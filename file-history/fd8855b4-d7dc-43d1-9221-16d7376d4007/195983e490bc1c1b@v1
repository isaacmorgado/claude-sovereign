      title: 'Why Core and Neck Matter',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Two of the most overlooked muscle groups that have outsized impact on your appearance:

**The Neck:**
A thick neck makes your head look proportionate, adds masculinity, and completely changes how you're perceived. Think about the difference between a pencil neck and a football player neck. Night and day.

**The Core:**
Beyond aesthetics, a strong core improves posture, supports lifting heavy, and defines that V-taper from waist. Weak core = weak everything else.

Most guys skip both because:
- Neck training seems weird or unsafe
- Core work is boring (crunches in the corner)
- Neither is a "mirror muscle"

This is a mistake. Both are trainable, and both pay massive dividends.`,

      content: `A thick neck is one of the most underrated aesthetic upgrades you can make:

**Visual Benefits:**
- Head looks proportionate to body
- Jawline appears stronger
- More masculine/dominant presence
- Fills out shirt collars
- Better photos from every angle

**Functional Benefits:**
- Reduced neck pain
- Better posture support
- Injury prevention (sports, accidents)
- Improved head position for mewing

**The Reality:**
Compare a skinny neck to a thick neck on the same person. It's a completely different look. Yet almost nobody trains it.

The neck is one of the fastest-growing muscle groups because most people have never trained it. You can add an inch to your neck in 2-3 months with consistent training.`,

      title: 'Neck Muscles to Train',
      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `Understanding what you're training helps you train it better:

**Sternocleidomastoid (SCM)**
- The muscles on the front/sides of your neck
- Creates that "thick neck" look from the front
- Trained with neck curls and lateral flexion

**Trapezius (Upper Traps)**
- The muscles connecting neck to shoulders
- Creates width and thickness from behind
- Trained with shrugs and neck extensions

**Splenius (Deep Neck Extensors)**
- Muscles on the back of the neck
- Important for head position and posture
- Trained with neck extensions

**Scalenes**
- Side of neck, often tight from desk work
- Important for balanced development
- Trained with lateral neck flexion

**Training All Directions:**
The neck moves in four directions:
1. Flexion (chin to chest)
2. Extension (looking up)
3. Lateral flexion (ear to shoulder)
4. Rotation (turning head)

Train all of them for balanced development.`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Start with bodyweight, progress to resistance:

**Beginner: Manual Resistance (First 4 Weeks)**
Use your hands to provide resistance:

1. **Neck Curls (Flexion)**
   - Push forehead against palm
   - Resist and try to bring chin to chest
   - 3x10-15 each direction

2. **Neck Extensions**
   - Cup back of head with hands
   - Resist and try to look up
   - 3x10-15

3. **Lateral Flexion**
   - Hand on side of head
   - Resist and try to touch ear to shoulder
   - 3x10-15 each side

**Intermediate: Neck Harness/Plate (After 1 Month)**
1. **Weighted Neck Curls**
   - Lie face up on bench, head off edge
   - Hold plate on forehead
   - Curl chin to chest
   - 3x15-20

2. **Weighted Neck Extensions**
   - Lie face down on bench, head off edge
   - Plate on back of head (or neck harness)
   - Extend neck up
   - 3x15-20

3. **Neck Harness Extensions**
   - Best for progressive overload
   - Start light (5-10 lbs)
   - Build to 25-45+ lbs over months

**Advanced: Neck Curls Machine**
If your gym has one (rare), use it. Best equipment for neck training.`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Here's a progressive neck training protocol:

**Phase 1: Manual Resistance (Weeks 1-4)**
- Frequency: 3x per week
- Duration: 5 minutes at end of workout
- All four directions, 2 sets each

**Phase 2: Light Weight (Weeks 5-8)**
- Add 2.5-5 lb plates
- Frequency: 2-3x per week
- 2-3 sets of 15-20 reps each direction
- Focus on mind-muscle connection

**Phase 3: Progressive Overload (Weeks 9+)**
- Increase weight when you hit 25 reps easily
- Work up to 3-4 sets of 15-20 reps
- 2x per week is sufficient at this stage

**Weekly Volume:**
- 6-12 sets per week is plenty
- Don't overtrain—neck recovers but can get sore easily
- Spread across 2-3 sessions

**Sample Session (10 Minutes):**
1. Neck Curls: 3x15-20
2. Neck Extensions: 3x15-20
3. Lateral Flexion: 2x15-20 each side

Add this at the end of any workout. It doesn't take long.`,

      title: 'Core: Beyond Crunches',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Your core is more than abs. It's the entire trunk stabilization system:

**Core Functions:**
1. **Anti-Extension** — Preventing back from arching (planks, ab wheel)
2. **Anti-Rotation** — Preventing torso twist (Pallof press)
3. **Anti-Lateral Flexion** — Preventing side bending (side planks, carries)
4. **Hip Flexion** — Bringing legs toward torso (leg raises)

**Why This Matters:**
Crunches only train one function (spinal flexion). A complete core routine trains all four. This builds functional strength that transfers to:
- Better posture
- Stronger lifts (squat, deadlift)
- Tighter waist appearance
- Reduced lower back pain

**The Ab Visibility Truth:**
You can do 1000 crunches but if you're at 20% body fat, you won't see your abs. Core training builds the muscle. Diet reveals it. Both are needed.`,

      title: 'Best Core Exercises',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Forget endless crunches. These exercises actually build a strong core:

**Anti-Extension:**
1. **Ab Wheel Rollouts** — The king of core exercises
2. **Plank Variations** — Start here if you're weak
3. **Dead Bug** — Coordination + stability

**Anti-Rotation:**
1. **Pallof Press** — Cable or band, squeeze and hold
2. **Single-Arm Carries** — Heavy dumbbell, walk straight
3. **Single-Arm Cable Rows** — Resist rotation while pulling

**Anti-Lateral Flexion:**
1. **Side Planks** — Basic but effective
2. **Suitcase Carries** — Heavy one-arm carry
3. **Copenhagen Planks** — Advanced, adductor + core

**Hip Flexion:**
1. **Hanging Leg Raises** — The best for lower abs
2. **Reverse Crunches** — Easier variation
3. **Lying Leg Raises** — Floor version

**The Vacuum:**
Not a strength exercise, but critical for waist control:
- Exhale fully
- Suck stomach in as hard as possible
- Hold 15-30 seconds
- Do daily, 5-10 reps`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Core can be trained frequently because the muscles recover fast:

**Option 1: Dedicated Core Days (2-3x/Week)**
Add 10-15 minutes of core work after upper body sessions:

- Ab Wheel Rollouts: 3x8-12
- Hanging Leg Raises: 3x10-15
- Pallof Press: 2x10-12 each side
- Side Plank: 2x30-45 sec each side

**Option 2: Integrated (Every Session)**
Add 1-2 core exercises to every workout:

- Day 1: Ab Wheel + Pallof Press
- Day 2: Leg Raises + Side Planks
- Day 3: Plank + Dead Bug
- Day 4: Repeat

**Option 3: Supersetting**
Between sets of other exercises:
- Superset Bench Press with Ab Wheel (during rest)
- Superset Squats with Dead Bug
- Efficient use of time

**Volume Guidelines:**
- 6-12 sets of direct core work per week
- Compounds (squats, deadlifts) also train core
- Don't overthink—consistency matters more than perfection

**Daily Vacuum Practice:**
- Morning, before eating: 5-10 vacuums, 15-30 sec holds
- This is cumulative—daily practice shrinks waist appearance`,

      id: 'obliques-warning',
      title: 'A Note on Oblique Training',
      humorLevel: 'medium-high',
      content: `Here's something most people get wrong:

**The Goal:**
A narrow waist and visible V-taper.

**The Mistake:**
Heavy weighted oblique exercises (side bends, wood chops with heavy weight).

**The Problem:**
Your obliques are muscles. If you train them with heavy resistance, they grow. Bigger obliques = wider waist. This is the opposite of what you want.

**The Solution:**
- Skip heavy direct oblique work entirely
- Obliques get enough stimulus from:
  - Compound lifts (squats, deadlifts)
  - Anti-rotation work (Pallof press)
  - Side planks (isometric, not hypertrophy-focused)

**For Most Guys:**
Never do weighted side bends. Never do heavy wood chops. Your obliques are probably already developed enough from other training. Adding size to them will widen your waist.

**Exception:**
If you're a competitive athlete who needs rotational power (golfer, baseball player), train obliques. For aesthetics? Skip the heavy stuff.`,

        'Weighted side bends can increase waist width',

**Week 5-8: Build**
- Neck: Add light weight (5-10 lbs), 3x per week
- Core: Progress to harder variations, add Pallof press
- Vacuum: 10 holds of 30 seconds

**Week 9+: Progress**
- Neck: Progressive overload, 2-3x per week, working toward 25+ lbs
- Core: Full routine, 2x per week, focus on getting stronger
- Vacuum: Maintenance, daily habit

**Expected Results:**
- Neck: 0.5-1 inch growth in first 2-3 months
- Core: Visible improvement in 4-6 weeks (if diet is right)
- Posture: Noticeable improvement in 2-4 weeks

**The Payoff:**
These are two of the highest-ROI muscle groups you can train. Minimal time investment, maximum visual and functional return. Don't skip them.`,
