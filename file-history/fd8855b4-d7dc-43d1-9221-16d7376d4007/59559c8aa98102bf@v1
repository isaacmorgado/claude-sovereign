      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Walking into the gym without a plan is like going to the grocery store hungry—you'll make bad decisions and leave unsatisfied.

**The Problem:**
Most guys either:
- Do random exercises they saw on Instagram
- Hit chest and arms every day, ignoring everything else
- Overcomplicate with 6-day PPL splits when they can barely make it 3x/week
- Follow a pro bodybuilder's routine when they've been lifting for 6 months

**The Fix:**
Choose a split that matches your:
- Available training days
- Experience level
- Recovery capacity
- Goals

Then stick with it for at least 8-12 weeks before changing anything.`,

      content: `Before we get into splits, these principles apply to everything:

**1. Progressive Overload**
You must increase weight, reps, or sets over time. If you're lifting the same weight for the same reps month after month, you're not growing.

**2. Volume Matters**
10-20 sets per muscle group per week is the hypertrophy sweet spot. Less than 10 is probably not enough. More than 20 has diminishing returns.

**3. Intensity (Effort)**
Most sets should be within 1-3 reps of failure. If you could do 5 more reps, you're not working hard enough.

**4. Recovery**
Muscles grow when you rest, not when you lift. Sleep 7-9 hours. Eat enough protein. Take rest days seriously.

**5. Consistency > Perfection**
A 3-day routine done consistently beats a 6-day routine you keep missing. Pick something sustainable.`,

      title: 'Bro Split (5 Days/Week)',
      humorLevel: 'medium-high',
      content: `**The Classic:**
- Monday: Chest
- Tuesday: Back
- Wednesday: Shoulders
- Thursday: Arms
- Friday: Legs

**The Truth:**
The bro split is often mocked as "suboptimal" because each muscle only gets hit once per week. Science says 2x per week frequency is better for hypertrophy.

**But Here's the Thing:**
If you've been training for years and want maximum volume per session, or if it's the only split you'll stick to consistently, it can still work.

**When It Makes Sense:**
- Advanced lifters who need 15-20+ sets per muscle
- Those who enjoy destroying one muscle group per session
- People who've tried other splits and prefer this

**When It Doesn't:**
- Beginners (you don't need that much volume)
- People who miss gym days frequently (then you never hit that muscle)
- Natural lifters who benefit from frequency

**The Compromise:**
If you like the bro split style, consider hitting each muscle 1.5x per week:
- Chest + Triceps
- Back + Biceps
- Shoulders + Legs (light)
- Arms + Rear Delts
- Legs (heavy)`,

      title: 'Choosing the Right Exercises',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Not all exercises are equal. Here's how to prioritize:

**Tier 1: Compound Movements (Build Your Foundation)**
These should make up 60-70% of your training:
- Squat variations
- Deadlift variations
- Bench press variations
- Overhead press variations
- Row variations
- Pull-up/pulldown variations

**Tier 2: Compound Accessories (Support Development)**
- Lunges, leg press, RDLs
- Dips, incline press
- Face pulls, rear delt work
- Curl and tricep compound movements

**Tier 3: Isolation (Target Weaknesses)**
- Lateral raises (for V-taper)
- Bicep curls (for arm peak)
- Tricep extensions (for arm size)
- Leg curls/extensions (for leg detail)
- Calf raises (for calf size)

**The Mistake:**
Building your routine around cable machines and isolation exercises. These are supplements to compounds, not replacements.`,
      tips: [
        'Master form on compounds before going heavy',
        'Isolations are for lagging body parts',
        'If short on time, cut isolations first, never compounds'

    {
      id: 'rep-ranges',
      title: 'Rep Ranges and What They Do',
      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `Different rep ranges serve different purposes:

**1-5 Reps (Strength Focus)**
- Heavy weight, low reps
- Best for building maximal strength
- Less time under tension for hypertrophy
- Good for compounds (squat, bench, deadlift)

**6-12 Reps (Hypertrophy Sweet Spot)**
- Moderate weight, moderate reps
- Best for muscle growth
- Good balance of mechanical tension and metabolic stress
- Where most of your training should live

**12-20+ Reps (Metabolic/Endurance)**
- Lighter weight, high reps
- Great for smaller muscles (side delts, rear delts)
- Good for pump and finishing sets
- Less effective for large muscle growth

**The Reality:**
Muscles grow across all rep ranges when taken close to failure. The "6-12 for hypertrophy" rule is a guideline, not a law.

**Practical Application:**
- Compounds: 5-10 reps
- Secondary compounds: 8-12 reps
- Isolations: 10-20 reps

Mix it up within these guidelines for variety.`,

      title: 'How to Progress',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `If you're not progressing, you're not growing. Here's how to ensure constant improvement:

**Method 1: Linear Progression (Beginners)**
Add weight every session:
- Week 1: Bench 135 x 3x8
- Week 2: Bench 140 x 3x8
- Week 3: Bench 145 x 3x8
- Continue until you stall

**Method 2: Double Progression (Intermediate)**
Work within a rep range, increase weight when you hit the top:
- Week 1: 185 x 3x8
- Week 2: 185 x 3x9
- Week 3: 185 x 3x10
- Week 4: 190 x 3x8 (restart)

**Method 3: Volume Progression (Advanced)**
Keep weight same, add sets:
- Week 1: 3 sets
- Week 2: 4 sets
- Week 3: 5 sets
- Week 4: Deload

**When You Stall:**
1. Check sleep and nutrition first
2. Deload (reduce volume/intensity for 1 week)
3. Try a different rep range or exercise variation
4. Accept that progress slows after the beginner phase`,

      title: 'Which Split Should You Choose?',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `The best split is the one you'll actually do consistently. Here's the decision tree:

**How many days can you REALISTICALLY train per week?**

**3 Days → Full Body**
- Best bang for buck with limited time
- Perfect for beginners

**4 Days → Upper/Lower**
- Great balance of volume and recovery
- Good for most intermediates

**5 Days → Upper/Lower/Upper/Lower/Full or PPL**
- More flexibility
- Good volume and frequency

**6 Days → PPL (Push/Pull/Legs 2x)**
- Maximum volume and frequency
- Requires excellent recovery
- Advanced or those with great genetics

**Be Honest With Yourself:**
If you're planning a 6-day split but realistically make it to the gym 3-4 times per week, you're doing yourself a disservice. A 4-day split done consistently beats a 6-day split done randomly.`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Here's what to do:

**Step 1: Choose Your Split**
Based on your available training days and experience level. When in doubt, go with fewer days and build up.

**Step 2: Write It Down**
Physically write or type your routine. Every exercise, sets, reps, and rest periods.

**Step 3: Track Every Workout**
Use an app or notebook. Record weight x reps for every set.

**Step 4: Progress Each Session**
Add weight, reps, or sets whenever possible. If you completed all prescribed reps, increase something next time.

**Step 5: Stick With It**
Minimum 8-12 weeks before changing programs. Program hopping is one of the biggest gains killers.

**Step 6: Deload When Needed**
Every 4-6 weeks, take a lighter week. This isn't weakness—it's smart programming.

The gym is simple: show up, lift more than last time, recover, repeat. Don't overcomplicate it.`,
