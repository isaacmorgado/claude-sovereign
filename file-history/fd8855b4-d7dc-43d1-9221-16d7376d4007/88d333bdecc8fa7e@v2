## Style Guide & Tone

### The 80/20 Rule

```
80% = Serious, actionable information
20% = Humor, personality, slang, pop culture references
```

### Tone Characteristics

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use "you", "your", "bro" | Use "one should", "users", "customers" |
| Be brutally honest | Sugarcoat or hedge |
| Use community slang naturally | Over-explain every term |
| Make pop culture references | Use dated references (pre-2020) |
| Acknowledge the grind | Promise overnight results |
| Roast gently (with love) | Be mean-spirited or cruel |
| Validate their efforts | Be condescending |

### Voice Examples

**Opening a section:**
```
❌ "This section covers the importance of maintaining proper hydration levels."
✅ "If you're not drinking enough water, your face is literally retaining fluid to
    compensate. You're bloatmaxxing yourself. Here's how to fix it."
```

**Explaining a concept:**
```
❌ "Body fat percentage significantly impacts facial aesthetics."
✅ "At 18% body fat, you're hoping good lighting saves you. At 11%, you ARE the
    good lighting. Lean is life, and your jawline knows it."
```

**Product recommendation:**
```
❌ "Consider adding creatine monohydrate to your supplement regimen."
✅ "Creatine is the only supplement that actually does what it says. You'll look
    slightly bigger immediately. Yes, it's water. No, nobody can tell. Take it."
```

## Copy Transformation Examples

### Example 1: Nose Hair Maintenance

**Original:**
> Visible nose hairs or ear hairs are a massive subtle turnoff. Regularly trim or use specialized electric trimmers. People rarely notice good grooming here, but they definitely notice when you neglect it.

**Ross-Style:**
> Nostril tentacles waving at people mid-conversation is an instant mog-killer. Nobody's going to tell you—they'll just slowly lose attraction and not know why. Get a trimmer. Use it weekly. This is bare minimum NPC maintenance, and you're not an NPC.

---

### Example 2: Body Fat Percentage

**Original:**
> The difference between 18-20% and 10-12% is the difference between a below average and above average looking guy.

**Ross-Style:**
> At 18% body fat, you're hoping good lighting saves you. At 11%, you ARE the good lighting.

> Here's the brutal truth: you can have god-tier bone structure, but if it's buried under a layer of bloat, you're frauding yourself out of your own genetics. Lean is life. Your jawline is in there somewhere—go find it.

---

### Example 3: Creatine Supplement

**Original:**
> Creatine Monohydrate (3-5g daily) - Supports muscle development and cognitive function. Evidence level: Strong.

**Ross-Style:**
> **Creatine Monohydrate** — The only supplement that actually does what it says on the tin. 5g daily, no loading phase needed, and you'll look slightly bigger immediately.
>
> Yes, it's water weight. No, nobody can tell the difference. You'll also think faster—studies show cognitive benefits that nobody talks about because "brain gains" doesn't sound as cool as "muscle gains."
>
> If you're not taking this, you're literally leaving free gains on the table. It costs like $0.10/day. Lock in.

---

### Example 4: Sleep Section Opening

**Original:**
> Sleep is essential for recovery and hormone optimization. Poor sleep leads to increased cortisol and water retention.

**Ross-Style:**
> Your sleep schedule is committing crimes against your face and you don't even know it.
>
> Here's what happens when you doom-scroll until 2am: cortisol spikes, testosterone tanks, and your body hoards water like it's preparing for a drought. You wake up looking like you aged 5 years overnight—puffy, tired, and wondering why your jawline decided to take the day off.
>
> Fix your sleep. Everything else gets easier.

---

### Example 5: Jaw Training Warning

**Original:**
> Avoid overtraining the masseter muscles as this can lead to an overly wide appearance.

**Ross-Style:**
> Listen, I need you to put down the mastic gum for a second.
>
> If your gonial angle is already looking like Minecraft Steve, you've gone too far. The goal is a defined jaw, not storing acorns for winter. Some guys get so obsessed with jaw training they end up with a FWHR that makes their head look like a shipping container.
>
> Train smart. Check yourself weekly. If your face is getting wider than your shoulders, it's time to let those masseters atrophy a bit.

## Regional Link Strategy

### Amazon Domain Mapping

| Region | Domain | Affiliate Tag | Currency |
|--------|--------|---------------|----------|
| US | amazon.com | looksmaxx-20 | USD |
| UK | amazon.co.uk | looksmaxx-21 | GBP |
| DE | amazon.de | looksmaxx-21 | EUR |
| FR | amazon.fr | looksmaxx-21 | EUR |
| AU | amazon.com.au | looksmaxx-22 | AUD |
| Asia | amzn.asia | looksmaxx-22 | Various |

### Detection Priority

```typescript
1. localStorage['user_region']     // User preference (highest priority)
2. navigator.language              // Browser locale
3. Intl.DateTimeFormat().resolvedOptions().timeZone  // Timezone fallback
4. 'us'                            // Default fallback
```

### Locale → Region Mapping

```typescript
const LOCALE_MAP = {
  'en-US': 'us',
  'en-GB': 'uk',
  'en-AU': 'au',
  'de-DE': 'de',
  'de-AT': 'de',
  'fr-FR': 'fr',
  'fr-CA': 'us',  // Ships from US
  'ja-JP': 'asia',
  'ko-KR': 'asia',
  'zh-CN': 'asia',
  // ... etc
};
```

### Fallback Strategy

When product unavailable in region:
1. Show "Ships internationally" badge
2. Link to AU store (widest availability)
3. Show estimated shipping note
