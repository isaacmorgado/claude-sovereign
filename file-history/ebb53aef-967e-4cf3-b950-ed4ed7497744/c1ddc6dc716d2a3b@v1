**Procedures Covered:**
| Procedure | What It Does |
|-----------|--------------|
| Liposuction | Removes localized fat deposits |
| Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL) | Transfers fat to buttocks |
| Tummy Tuck (Abdominoplasty) | Removes excess abdominal skin |
| Breast Augmentation | Increases breast size |
| Breast Reduction | Reduces breast size |
| Breast Lift (Mastopexy) | Lifts sagging breasts |
| Mommy Makeover | Combination post-pregnancy |

**Important Principles:**
1. Surgery is not a weight loss solution
2. Best results at stable, healthy weight
3. Results are permanent but aging continues
4. Every surgery has risks
5. Choose surgeon based on skill, not price

**This Guide Covers:**
Each major procedure in detail, including costs, recovery, risks, and realistic expectations.`,

      title: 'Liposuction',
      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `Liposuction removes fat from specific areas that resist diet and exercise.

**What It Treats:**
- Stubborn fat deposits
- Common areas: abdomen, flanks (love handles), thighs, arms, back, chin

**What It's NOT:**
- Not a weight loss procedure
- Not for loose skin (may make it worse)
- Not permanent if you gain significant weight

**Techniques:**
| Technique | How It Works | Notes |
|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Tumescent | Fluid injected, fat suctioned | Standard, safest |
| Ultrasound (VASER) | Sound waves liquefy fat | Smoother results |
| Laser (SmartLipo) | Laser liquefies fat | Some skin tightening |
| Power-Assisted (PAL) | Mechanical vibration | Faster extraction |

**Best Candidates:**
- Near ideal weight (within 30% of goal)
- Good skin elasticity
- Localized fat deposits
- Realistic expectations

**Recovery:**
| Timeframe | Expect |
|-----------|--------|
| Days 1-3 | Significant swelling, soreness |
| Weeks 1-2 | Compression garment 24/7 |
| Weeks 2-6 | Swelling decreasing, can exercise lightly |
| Months 2-3 | Most swelling gone |
| Months 3-6 | Final result |

**Costs:**
- $2,000-5,000 per area (USA)
- Multiple areas: $5,000-15,000
- Turkey/Mexico: $1,500-4,000 total`,

      title: 'Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL)',
      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `The BBL transfers fat from your waist, back, and flanks to your buttocks—creating an hourglass figure.

**The Procedure:**
1. Liposuction of donor areas (360 lipo)
2. Fat processing and purification
3. Fat injection into buttocks (multiple layers)
4. Creates roundness and projection

**Why It's Popular:**
- Two benefits: smaller waist + larger buttocks
- Uses your own tissue (natural)
- Can be dramatic transformation

**The Critical Warning:**
**BBL has the highest mortality rate of any common cosmetic surgery.**

The risk is fat embolism—fat entering the bloodstream and traveling to lungs or heart. Rates have been reported as high as 1 in 3,000 (compared to 1 in 50,000 for most cosmetic surgery).

**Safer BBL Techniques:**
- Ultrasound-guided injection (sees where fat is going)
- Subcutaneous injection only (not into muscle)
- Experienced, high-volume surgeons
- Proper patient selection

**Candidates:**
- Enough donor fat (usually BMI 23+)
- Good skin elasticity
- Accepts risks after full understanding
- Can avoid sitting for 2-4 weeks

**Recovery:**
| Timeframe | Expect |
|-----------|--------|
| Weeks 1-2 | No sitting directly on buttocks |
| Weeks 2-4 | BBL pillow for sitting |
| Weeks 4-6 | Light sitting, no exercise |
| Months 2-3 | Resume normal activities |
| Months 3-6 | Final result (some fat reabsorbs) |

**Fat Survival:**
60-80% of transferred fat typically survives. Some reabsorption is normal. Weight gain after can increase size; weight loss will decrease it.

**Costs:**
- USA: $8,000-20,000
- Miami (BBL capital): $8,000-15,000
- Turkey: $3,000-6,000
- Colombia: $4,000-8,000`,

      title: 'Tummy Tuck (Abdominoplasty)',
      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `A tummy tuck removes excess abdominal skin and tightens the abdominal muscles.

**What It Treats:**
- Loose, sagging abdominal skin
- Separated abdominal muscles (diastasis recti)
- Excess fat in the abdomen
- Post-pregnancy changes
- After major weight loss

**Types:**

**Mini Tummy Tuck**
- Lower abdomen only
- Smaller incision
- No navel repositioning
- Less dramatic result
- Cost: $4,000-8,000

**Full Tummy Tuck**
- Hip to hip incision
- Navel repositioned
- Muscle tightening
- Removes more skin
- Cost: $6,000-15,000

**Extended Tummy Tuck**
- Includes flanks/sides
- Longer incision
- For significant weight loss patients
- Cost: $8,000-18,000

**Fleur-de-Lis**
- Vertical and horizontal incisions
- For massive weight loss
- Most extensive
- Cost: $10,000-20,000

**What's Removed:**
The "apron" of skin and fat from navel to pubic area. The remaining skin is pulled tight and sutured.

**Recovery:**
| Timeframe | Expect |
|-----------|--------|
| Days 1-5 | Significant pain, can't stand straight |
| Weeks 1-2 | Bent-over walking, drains out |
| Weeks 2-6 | Gradually straightening |
| Weeks 6-8 | Light exercise |
| Months 3-6 | Final result |

**The Scar:**
Hip to hip, hidden in bikini line. It's permanent but fades over 12-18 months. Worth considering if scarring is a major concern.`,

      title: 'Breast Procedures',
      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `Breast surgery is highly personal. Here's what each option offers:

**Breast Augmentation**
What: Implants to increase size

Types:
- Silicone (most natural feel)
- Saline (adjustable, firmer)
- Fat transfer (natural, limited increase)

Placement:
- Under muscle (more natural look, longer recovery)
- Over muscle (easier recovery, more visible edges)

Incision options:
- Under breast (inframammary)
- Around nipple (periareolar)
- Armpit (transaxillary)

Cost: $5,000-12,000
Recovery: 1-2 weeks off work, 6 weeks no exercise

**Breast Reduction**
What: Removes excess breast tissue and skin

Best for:
- Back/neck pain
- Very large breasts
- Asymmetry
- Often covered by insurance (medical necessity)

Cost: $5,000-12,000 (may be covered)
Recovery: 2-4 weeks, 6-8 weeks full activity

**Breast Lift (Mastopexy)**
What: Lifts and reshapes sagging breasts

Best for:
- Sagging after weight loss or pregnancy
- Nipples pointing downward
- Loss of volume/shape

Can combine with implants for lift + volume

Cost: $5,000-10,000
Recovery: 2-3 weeks, 6 weeks full activity

**Considerations:**

| Factor | Augmentation | Reduction | Lift |
|--------|--------------|-----------|------|
| Scars | Minimal | Significant | Moderate |
| Sensation changes | Possible | Possible | Possible |
| Breastfeeding impact | Usually ok | May affect | Usually ok |
| Revision rate | 10-20% over 10 yrs | Low | Low |`,

      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `A "mommy makeover" is a combination of procedures to address post-pregnancy body changes.

**Typical Combination:**
- Tummy tuck (addresses loose skin, separated muscles)
- Breast procedure (lift, augmentation, or reduction)
- Liposuction (stubborn fat areas)

**Why Combine:**
- One recovery period
- Cost savings vs. separate surgeries
- Comprehensive result
- Single anesthesia event

**Common Post-Pregnancy Issues Addressed:**
| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Loose abdominal skin | Tummy tuck |
| Diastasis recti (muscle separation) | Tummy tuck with repair |
| Deflated/sagging breasts | Lift and/or implants |
| Stubborn fat (flanks, thighs) | Liposuction |
| Stretched areolas | Nipple reduction |

**Timing:**
- Wait 6-12 months after last pregnancy
- Wait 3-6 months after stopping breastfeeding
- Be at stable weight
- Done having children (preferred)

**Recovery:**
More significant than single procedures:
- Week 1: Significant limitation
- Week 2-3: Moderate limitation
- Week 4-6: Light activity
- Week 8+: Resume exercise
- 6 months: Final result

**Costs:**
| Package | Range |
|---------|-------|
| Basic (tummy + breast lift) | $12,000-20,000 |
| Full (tummy + breast + lipo) | $18,000-30,000 |
| Extensive (all above + arm lift) | $25,000-40,000 |`,

3. Where is surgery performed? Is it accredited?
4. Who handles complications if they occur?
5. Can I see before/after of similar body types?
6. What's included in the quoted price?

**Before/After Evaluation:**
Look for:
