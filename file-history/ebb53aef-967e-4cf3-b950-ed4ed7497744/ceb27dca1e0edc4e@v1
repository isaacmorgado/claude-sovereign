      content: `Feminine beauty has measurable characteristics—softer angles, balanced proportions, and specific ratios. Understanding these helps you enhance what you have.

**Markers of Feminine Appearance:**
- Softer jawline (less angular)
- Fuller lips relative to face
- Higher, more arched brows
- Larger eyes relative to face
- Smaller, refined nose
- Full cheeks
- Smooth, clear skin

**What Affects Feminine Appearance:**
| Factor | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Bone structure | Fixed (without surgery) |
| Fat distribution | Hormonal, partially modifiable |
| Skin quality | Highly modifiable |
| Brows and eyes | Very modifiable |
| Lips | Modifiable with filler |
| Hair | Very modifiable |

**The Goal:**
Enhance what you have while maintaining natural appearance. Over-done work often looks less feminine, not more.

**This Guide Covers:**
1. Feature-by-feature enhancement
2. Non-surgical soft feminization
3. Grooming and styling
4. Makeup techniques
5. Procedures that help`,

**Head Hair:**

**Feminine Characteristics:**

Layers around the face soften angular features and create movement.

- Chin
- Sideburns

- Bikini area

**Hair Removal Options:**
| Method | Duration | Cost | Notes |
|--------|----------|------|-------|

| IPL/Laser | Long-term/permanent | High upfront | Best for dark hair, light skin |
| Electrolysis | Permanent | High | Works on all hair colors |
| Depilatory creams | 1-2 weeks | Low | Can irritate sensitive skin |

**Facial Hair:**
For visible facial hair (upper lip, chin):
- Laser/IPL most effective long-term
- Threading for shaping
- Dermaplaning removes peach fuzz (also exfoliates)`,

      title: 'Your Action Plan',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Here's how to approach feminine enhancement:

**Phase 1: Foundation (Month 1-2)**
- Optimize skincare routine (clarity, glow)
- Shape brows properly (threading, professional)
- Address any skin concerns (acne, texture)
- Establish hair care routine

**Phase 2: Grooming (Month 2-3)**
- Hair removal as desired (consider laser)
- Lash enhancement (serum, lift)
- Brow enhancement (lamination, tint)
- Basic makeup skills

**Phase 3: Non-Invasive Enhancement (Month 3-6)**
If desired:
- Consider lip filler (start conservative)
- Masseter Botox if jaw is concern
- Cheek filler for hollowness

**Phase 4: Evaluate (Month 6+)**
- What concerns remain?
- Are non-surgical options sufficient?
- Would procedures address root issues?

**Priority Order for Most Impact:**
1. Clear, glowing skin
2. Well-shaped brows
3. Enhanced lashes
4. Fuller lips (if desired)
5. Structural procedures (if needed)

**Budget Approach:**
| Budget | Focus |
|--------|-------|
| Low ($50-100/mo) | Skincare, grooming, makeup |
| Medium ($200-500/mo) | Add lash/brow treatments |
| Higher (as needed) | Filler, Botox, procedures |

**The Philosophy:**
Feminine enhancement should enhance YOUR natural features, not create a generic "Instagram face." Work with what you have. Soften, enhance, maintain—but don't lose what makes you unique.`,
