      content: `Glass skin (유리 피부) is the Korean beauty ideal of skin so hydrated, clear, and luminous that it looks like glass—smooth, poreless, and almost translucent.

**The Characteristics:**
- Intensely hydrated, not oily
- Even tone with no visible discoloration
- Smooth texture, minimal visible pores
- Natural luminosity (not shimmer or glitter)
- Plump, bouncy appearance

**What It's NOT:**
- Shiny/greasy skin
- Makeup-based glow
- Filters and facetune
- Genetics-only (though it helps)

**Can Anyone Achieve It?**
Realistically, genetics play a role. But most people can get 80% of the way there with the right routine. The key is hydration, barrier health, and texture refinement.

**This Guide Covers:**
1. The Korean skincare philosophy
2. The 7-step glass skin routine
3. Key K-beauty ingredients
4. Product layering order
5. Common mistakes to avoid`,

      title: 'The Korean Skincare Philosophy',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `K-beauty is fundamentally different from Western skincare:

**Western Approach:**
- Fix problems as they arise
- Aggressive actives (retinol, acids)
- Minimal steps, maximum strength
- "No pain, no gain" mentality

**Korean Approach:**
- Prevention over treatment
- Gentle, consistent care
- Layer multiple hydrating products
- Barrier health is everything
- Skin is meant to be nourished, not punished

**Core K-Beauty Principles:**

**1. Double Cleansing**
Oil-based cleanser first (dissolves makeup, sunscreen, sebum), then water-based cleanser. Clean slate without stripping.

**2. Layers of Hydration**
Instead of one heavy moisturizer, multiple lightweight layers that absorb better and hydrate deeper.

**3. Essences and Toners**
Not the astringent "toners" of the West. Hydrating, fermented first layers that prep skin to absorb everything after.

**4. Pat, Don't Rub**
Pressing products into skin increases absorption and prevents tugging.

**5. Sunscreen Always**
Even indoors. Even on cloudy days. Non-negotiable.`,

      title: 'The Art of Layering',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `The order matters. Layering incorrectly = wasted product and poor results.

**The Golden Rule:**
Thinnest → Thickest consistency

**The Complete Order:**
1. Oil cleanser (PM only)
2. Water cleanser
3. Toner/First essence (watery)
4. Essence (slightly thicker)
5. Serum/Ampoule (targeted)
6. Emulsion (light moisturizer)
7. Cream (heavier moisturizer)
8. Facial oil (if used)
9. Sleeping pack (PM) or Sunscreen (AM)

**Layering Tips:**

**The 7-Skin Method:**
Apply 7 layers of the same hydrating toner. Sounds excessive, works incredibly. Each thin layer absorbs fully before the next.

**Wait Times:**
| Product | Wait Time |
|---------|-----------|
| After cleansing | Immediately apply toner |
| After AHA/BHA | 20 minutes (pH-dependent) |
| After Vitamin C | 10-15 minutes |
| After retinol | 20 minutes before next steps |
| Other layers | Until absorbed (usually 30-60 sec) |

**How to Know It's Absorbed:**
- Skin feels slightly tacky but not wet
- Product is no longer visible
- Skin feels plump, not greasy`,

**Oily Skin:**
- Skip heavy creams, use gel moisturizers

- Fragrance-free products
- Skip actives initially
- Centella and ceramides are safe bets
- Avoid: Too many new products at once

**Acne-Prone:**
- Non-comedogenic products
- BHA is your friend

      humorLevel: 'high',
      content: `Avoid these glass skin fails:

**Mistake 1: Too Many Steps, Wrong Products**
A 12-step routine with mediocre products beats nothing, but a 5-step routine with great products is more effective. Quality over quantity.

**Mistake 2: Skipping Sunscreen**
You're hydrating and brightening at night, then letting UV undo it during the day. SPF is part of glass skin.

**Mistake 3: Over-Exfoliating**
Using AHA, BHA, and retinol every day because you want faster results. Your barrier is destroyed. Now you have red, irritated, definitely-not-glass skin.

**Mistake 4: Applying Products Wrong**
Rubbing instead of patting. Applying to dry skin instead of damp. Not waiting between layers.

**Mistake 5: Expecting Overnight Results**
Korean women have done this since childhood. Your two weeks won't match their two decades. Be patient.

**Mistake 6: Ignoring Diet and Sleep**
No skincare routine overcomes chronic dehydration, poor sleep, and junk food. Internal health shows externally.

**Mistake 7: Copying Someone Else's Routine**
Your skin type is different. What works for oily Korean skin may not work for dry Western skin. Adapt.

**Mistake 8: Product Hoarding Without Consistency**
Buying 47 products and using each twice isn't a routine. Pick a core set and stick with it.`,

      content: `Products are only part of the equation:

**Diet:**
- High water intake (skin is 64% water)
- Fermented foods (kimchi, etc.) for gut-skin connection
- Low sugar, low dairy (controversial but many see improvements)
- Collagen-rich foods (bone broth, fish)
- Green tea antioxidants

**Sleep:**
- "Beauty sleep" is real
- Silk pillowcases to reduce friction
- Back sleeping to prevent sleep lines
- 7-9 hours for proper skin repair

**Stress:**
- Cortisol = inflammation = poor skin
- Korean beauty rituals double as self-care
- The routine itself is meditative

**Environment:**
- Humidifiers in dry climates
- Air purifiers for pollution
- Changing pillowcases frequently
- Clean phone screens

**What Korean Women Do Differently:**
- Start skincare early (taught as children)
- Consistent daily routine without skipping
- Prevention mindset over treatment
- Skin health = overall health philosophy
- Regular dermatologist visits are normalized`,

**Week 1: The Basics**

**Month 2-3: Refine**
- Adjust routine for your skin's response

- Consider sleeping masks

**Ongoing: Maintain**
- Consistency is everything
- Monthly photo comparisons
- Adjust for seasons (richer in winter, lighter in summer)

**Timeline Expectations:**
| Timeframe | What to Expect |
|-----------|----------------|

| 3 months | Significant improvement in skin quality |
| 6 months+ | Near-glass skin for most people |
