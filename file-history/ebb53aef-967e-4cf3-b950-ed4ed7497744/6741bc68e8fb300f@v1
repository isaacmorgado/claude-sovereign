Nostril tentacles waving at people mid-conversation. Crusty lips. Unibrow situation developing. Breath that could clear a room.

**Nobody tells you this stuff.** Your friends won't. Your family's given up. Tinder matches just unmatch without explanation.

This guide is the checklist. The bare minimum. The "if you're not doing this, nothing else matters" baseline.

Everything here is simple. Nothing is expensive. No excuses.`,

**The Protocol:**
1. **Brush 2x daily** — Electric toothbrush, 2 minutes minimum. If you're using a manual toothbrush in 2024, that's NPC behavior.
2. **Floss daily** — Yes, actually. The stuff between your teeth is rotting. Get string floss or a water flosser.
3. **Tongue scrape** — This is the secret weapon. 70% of bad breath comes from bacteria on your tongue. Takes 10 seconds, changes everything.

**The Reality Check:**
- You can't smell your own breath
- Everyone's too polite to tell you
- This is actively limiting your social and romantic life
- Fix it now`,

**Why This Matters:**
Your lips are one of the first things people notice. Dry, cracked lips read as "doesn't take care of himself" instantly.

**The Fix:**
- Apply lip balm or Aquaphor morning and night
- Reapply after eating or drinking
- At night, use a heavier occlusive (Aquaphor > chapstick)

**Common Mistakes:**
- Licking your lips (makes it worse)
- Flavored lip balms (you'll lick them)
- Forgetting entirely (check your lips right now)

**Pro tip:** Keep one by your bed, one in your pocket, one at your desk. The best lip balm is the one you actually use.`,

      content: `Nostril tentacles waving at people mid-conversation is an instant mog-killer. Nobody's going to tell you—they'll just slowly lose attraction and not know why.

**The Protocol:**
- Trim nose hairs weekly (Sunday maintenance)
- Check ear hair too (yes, you have some)
- Use a proper trimmer, not scissors (you WILL cut yourself)

**The Psychology:**
People rarely notice good grooming here, but they DEFINITELY notice when you neglect it. It's one of those things that can only hurt you, never help. Just eliminate it.

Get a trimmer. Use it weekly. This is bare minimum NPC maintenance, and you're not an NPC.`,

      content: `There's a zone between "unibrow" and "Instagram influencer overplucked" that you're aiming for.

**What to Do:**
1. **Define the gap** — There should be clear separation between brows. Pluck strays between them.
2. **Clean the edges** — Remove random hairs above and below the brow line.
3. **Don't reshape** — You're cleaning, not redesigning. Keep your natural brow shape.

**What NOT to Do:**
- Don't thin them out (thicker brows = more masculine)
- Don't create an artificial arch
- Don't touch the main body of the brow
- Don't wax (too aggressive for maintenance)

**The Goal:**
Clean and intentional, not "did someone do your eyebrows?" If people can tell you've groomed them, you've gone too far.`,

**Clean-Shaven:**
- Shave every 1-3 days depending on growth
- Use a proper shave cream (not canned foam)
- Shave with the grain first, then against if needed
- Moisturize after

**Stubble:**
- This is the sweet spot for most faces
- Maintain at 1-3mm with a trimmer
- Clean up the neck and cheek lines
- Edge the mustache above the lip line

**Beard:**
- Keep it trimmed and shaped
- Define the neckline (2 fingers above Adam's apple)
- Use beard oil if longer than 1 week growth
- Wash it (yes, like hair)

**The Key:** Whatever style you choose, it should look like a choice, not like you ran out of razors.`,

- Trim weekly
- File rough edges (yes, men can use nail files)
- Clean under nails daily
- Push back cuticles after shower (optional but clean look)

**What You're Avoiding:**
- Nails that extend past fingertips
- Visible dirt under nails
- Ragged, bitten edges
- Hangnails

**The Layers:**
1. **Base** — Shower daily with unscented or lightly scented soap
2. **Deodorant** — Antiperspirant, applied at night (not morning)
3. **Fragrance** — 2-3 sprays MAX of a quality cologne

**Application:**
- Spray on pulse points: wrists, neck, chest
- Don't rub wrists together (breaks down scent)
- Less is more—you want a "lean in" scent, not an announcement

**Cologne Investment:**
One quality fragrance beats five cheap ones. Bleu de Chanel or similar safe bet. Get compliments, not complaints.

**The Test:** If people can smell you from more than arm's length, you've applied too much.`,

**Daily:**
- Style it. Every day. Even if it's a 2-minute routine.
- Use product appropriate to your hair type (matte for thin, pomade for thick)
- Don't touch it throughout the day (transfers oil)

**Every 4-6 Weeks:**
- Get it cut by a real barber
- Find a style that works for your face shape and hair type
- Bring reference photos (they're not just for women)

**Washing:**
- Most guys over-wash (strips natural oils)
- Every 2-3 days is usually enough
- Use conditioner if your hair is longer than 1 inch

**If Thinning:**
- Accept it early or treat it early
- Minoxidil + finasteride (consult a doctor)
- Or just buzz it—a clean shave beats a comb-over every time`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `If you're noticing recession or thinning, you've got two choices: treat it or accept it. There's no middle ground of denial.

**Recognize the Signs Early:**
- Hairline moving back at temples (receding)
- Crown getting thinner (you can't see it, but others can)
- More hair in the drain/pillow
- Scalp visible under bright lights

**The Treatment Stack (The "Big 3"):**

| Treatment | What It Does | Cost |
|-----------|--------------|------|
| **Minoxidil 5%** | Stimulates follicles, extends growth phase | $20-40/6 months |
| **Finasteride 1mg** | Blocks DHT, stops progression | $10-30/month |
| **Ketoconazole Shampoo** | Anti-inflammatory, mild DHT blocker | $15/bottle |

**Timeline:**
- Months 1-3: Possible shedding (normal, it's working)
- Months 4-6: Stabilization, slowed loss
- Months 6-12: Regrowth begins for responders
- Year 1+: Maintenance mode

**The Decision:**
If you're going to treat, start NOW. The earlier you start, the more hair you save. Once a follicle is dead, it's gone.

**The Alternative:**
If treatment isn't for you, own the look:
- Buzz it short or shave clean
- Grow a beard if you can (bald + beard is a classic look)
- Get lean—face definition matters more when hair is gone
- Confidence > coping

We'll have a full hair loss guide coming soon. For now, don't wait—decide early.`,

      content: `Whether you're trying to grow a beard or maintain one, here's what actually matters:

**If You Can Grow One:**

**Stubble (1-5mm):**
- Trim every 2-3 days
- This is often the most attractive option for most faces
- Clean neckline 2 fingers above Adam's apple
- Edge cheek line naturally

**Short Beard (5-10mm):**
- Trim weekly with guard
- Use beard oil after showering
- Keep edges sharp

**Full Beard (10mm+):**
- Wash with beard shampoo
- Apply beard oil or balm daily
- Comb/brush to train direction
- Trim every 1-2 weeks for shape
- Consider a barber for initial shaping

**If You CAN'T Grow One (Yet):**

The Minoxidil beard protocol works for many guys:
1. Apply minoxidil 5% to cheeks 2x daily
2. Wait 6-24 months (yes, it takes time)
3. Vellus hairs → Terminal hairs
4. Once terminal, effects are permanent
5. Add dermarolling 0.5mm weekly for better absorption

**Important:** This is off-label use. Results vary. Most guys see significant improvement, but genetics still matter.

**Patchy Beard Solutions:**
- Let it grow longer—length hides patches
- Strategic trimming to balance density
- Focus on stubble length if very patchy
- Some patches fill in over time (give it 3-6 months)

We'll have a full beard growth guide with protocols coming soon.`,
