      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `The hourglass figure—wider shoulders and hips, smaller waist—is about proportions, not just size. And it's more achievable than you think.

**What Creates the Hourglass:**
- Developed shoulders (creates upper width)
- Narrow waist (the contrast point)
- Developed glutes and hips (creates lower width)
- Low enough body fat to see definition

**What You CAN Change:**
- Muscle development (glutes, shoulders, back)
- Body fat percentage and distribution
- Posture (affects how you look)
- Waist tightness through training

**What You CAN'T Change (Without Surgery):**
- Hip bone width
- Rib cage size
- Where you store fat genetically
- Overall skeletal frame

**The Good News:**
Most women focus only on cardio and "toning." Actually building muscle in the right places—glutes, shoulders, back—dramatically changes proportions.

**This Guide Covers:**
1. Training for curves
2. Waist management
3. Nutrition approach
4. Non-surgical enhancement
5. Surgical options
6. Realistic expectations`,

      content: `The gym is where you build the shape. Here's what to prioritize:

**Priority 1: Glutes**
This is the biggest opportunity. Most women are quad-dominant and glute-weak. Building glutes:
- Creates the lower "width" of the hourglass
- Lifts the appearance of your rear
- Balances leg proportions

**Best Glute Exercises:**
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Hip Thrusts | 4x10-12 | THE glute builder |
| Romanian Deadlifts | 3x10-12 | Stretches and loads |
| Bulgarian Split Squats | 3x10-12 | Unilateral focus |
| Cable Kickbacks | 3x15-20 | Isolation/finisher |
| Sumo Deadlifts | 3x8-10 | Hip-dominant pull |

**Priority 2: Shoulders**
Creates the upper "width" for hourglass proportion.

**Best Shoulder Exercises:**
| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Lateral Raises | 4x15-20 | Side width |
| Overhead Press | 3x8-10 | Overall development |
| Face Pulls | 3x15-20 | Rear delts, posture |
| Front Raises | 2x12-15 | Front cap |

**Priority 3: Back**
Creates V-taper from behind, improves posture.

**Weekly Split Example:**
| Day | Focus | Key Exercises |
|-----|-------|---------------|
| 1 | Glutes/Hamstrings | Hip thrusts, RDLs, leg curls |
| 2 | Upper Body | Shoulder press, lat pulldown, rows |
| 3 | Quads/Calves | Squats, leg press, lunges |
| 4 | Glutes/Back | Deadlifts, pull-ups, hip thrusts |
| 5 | Shoulders/Arms | Lateral raises, curls, triceps |`,

      title: 'Waist Management',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `The waist is the center of the hourglass. Here's how to keep it tight:

**What Widens the Waist:**
- Body fat (especially visceral)
- Heavy oblique training
- Poor posture (belly pooch)
- Bloating and digestive issues

**What Keeps It Tight:**
- Low body fat (18-25% for most women)
- Core stability without bulk
- Transverse abdominis training
- Good posture

**The Vacuum Exercise:**
The classic waist-tightening exercise:
1. Exhale all air
2. Suck stomach in as far as possible
3. Hold for 15-30 seconds
4. Repeat 5-10 times
5. Do daily, preferably morning on empty stomach

**Core Training (Right Way):**
| Do | Avoid |
|----|-------|
| Planks | Heavy weighted side bends |
| Dead bugs | Heavy cable woodchops |
| Bird dogs | High-rep oblique exercises |
| Vacuums | Russian twists with weight |
| Moderate ab work | Overdeveloping obliques |

**The Waist Trainer Myth:**
Waist trainers don't permanently reduce your waist. They:
- Temporarily compress
- May cause rib/organ issues long-term
- Don't burn fat or build muscle
- The results disappear when you remove them

**What Actually Works:**
- Low body fat through diet
- Core stability training
- Posture improvement
- Avoiding oblique overdevelopment`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `You can't out-train a bad diet, and you can't build curves without proper fuel:

**Phase 1: If You Need to Lose Fat**
- Moderate calorie deficit (300-500 below maintenance)
- High protein (0.8-1g per lb bodyweight)
- Prioritize whole foods
- Don't crash diet—preserves muscle

**Phase 2: Building Muscle (Curves)**
- Slight surplus (100-200 calories above maintenance)
- High protein (1g per lb minimum)
- Carbs around workouts for performance
- This is where curves actually get built

**The Recomp Option:**
At maintenance calories with high protein:
- Lose fat while gaining muscle
- Slower but effective for beginners
- Less dramatic weight changes
- Body composition improves

**Protein Is Non-Negotiable:**
| Protein Intake | Outcome |
|----------------|---------|
| Under 0.5g/lb | Muscle loss, no curves |
| 0.5-0.7g/lb | Maintenance, slow progress |
| 0.8-1g/lb | Optimal for most |
| 1g+/lb | Aggressive building |

**Meal Timing (Simple Version):**
- Protein every meal
- Carbs around training
- Fats for hormone health
- Total daily intake matters most`,

**Brazilian Butt Lift (BBL)**
- Fat transferred from waist/back to buttocks

**BBL Safety:**
- Most dangerous common cosmetic procedure
- Fat embolism risk (fat enters bloodstream)
- Choose ONLY board-certified plastic surgeon
- High-volume, experienced surgeon critical
- Newer ultrasound-guided techniques safer

**Liposuction**
- Removes fat from specific areas
- Waist, flanks, thighs, arms
- Can enhance hourglass by reducing waist
- Cost: $3,000-8,000 per area
- Recovery: 2-4 weeks, compression garments 4-6 weeks

**Tummy Tuck**
- Removes excess skin and fat
- Tightens abdominal muscles
- Best for: Post-pregnancy, major weight loss
- Cost: $6,000-15,000
- Recovery: 4-6 weeks significant, 3-6 months full

**Breast Augmentation/Reduction**

**Ectomorph (Naturally Thin):**

- Requires consistent surplus eating
- Glutes will grow, just takes longer
- Focus on heavy compound lifts
- Timeline: 1-2 years for significant change

- Builds muscle relatively easily
- Focus on proportions (don't overdevelop quads)
- Timeline: 6-12 months for noticeable change

**Endomorph (Naturally Curvier):**
- May need to lose fat to reveal shape
- Muscle builds under fat layer
- Easier to build lower body
- Focus on fat loss + muscle retention
- Timeline: Variable based on starting point

**What Training Can Achieve (No Surgery):**
| Area | Change Possible |
|------|-----------------|
| Glutes | 2-4 inches growth |
| Shoulders | Significant cap development |
| Waist | 1-2 inches reduction (fat loss) |

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Here's how to approach body contouring:

**Phase 1: Assessment**
- What's your current body fat %?
- What proportions do you want to change?
- Are you willing to train consistently?
- What's your budget for potential procedures?

**Phase 2: Foundation Training (Months 1-3)**
- Start resistance training 3-4x weekly
- Prioritize glutes, shoulders, back
- Learn proper form on key exercises
- Build work capacity and habit

**Phase 3: Nutrition Optimization (Ongoing)**
- Calculate maintenance calories
- Set protein goal (0.8-1g per lb)
- Slight deficit if fat loss needed, slight surplus if building
- Track for 4-8 weeks to assess

**Phase 4: Progressive Overload (Months 4-12)**
- Add weight or reps each week
- Train glutes 2-3x weekly
- Take monthly progress photos
- Measure key areas monthly

**Phase 5: Evaluate (12+ Months)**
- What has training achieved?
- What remains that bothers you?
- Consider non-surgical options for stubborn areas
- Surgical consultation if desired

**Measurement Protocol:**
| Area | How Often |
|------|-----------|
| Waist (narrowest) | Monthly |
| Hips (widest) | Monthly |
| Glutes (fullest) | Monthly |
| Thighs | Monthly |
| Photos (front, side, back) | Monthly |

**The Commitment:**
Natural body contouring takes 1-2+ years of consistent training. Most women quit before seeing real results. The transformation is possible, but it requires patience.`,
