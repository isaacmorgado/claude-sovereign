## The Problem

Most guys either:

- Do random exercises they saw on Instagram
- Hit chest and arms every day, ignoring everything else
- Overcomplicate with 6-day PPL splits when they can barely make it 3x/week
- Follow a pro bodybuilder's routine when they've been lifting for 6 months

## The Fix

Choose a split that matches your:

- **Available training days** — Be realistic
- **Experience level** — Beginners need less volume
- **Recovery capacity** — Sleep, stress, nutrition all matter
- **Goals** — Strength vs hypertrophy vs both

Then stick with it for at least 8-12 weeks before changing anything.`,

      content: `Before we get into splits, these principles apply to everything:

---

## 1. Progressive Overload

You must increase weight, reps, or sets over time. If you're lifting the same weight for the same reps month after month, you're not growing.

## 2. Volume Matters

| Weekly Sets Per Muscle | Effect |
|------------------------|--------|
| **< 10 sets** | Probably not enough for growth |
| **10-20 sets** | Hypertrophy sweet spot |
| **> 20 sets** | Diminishing returns |

## 3. Intensity (Effort)

Most sets should be within 1-3 reps of failure. If you could do 5 more reps, you're not working hard enough.

## 4. Recovery

Muscles grow when you rest, not when you lift:

- Sleep 7-9 hours
- Eat enough protein
- Take rest days seriously

## 5. Consistency > Perfection

A 3-day routine done consistently beats a 6-day routine you keep missing. Pick something sustainable.`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Best For:**
- Beginners (first 6-12 months)
- Busy schedules (only 3 gym days)
- Coming back after time off

---

## Why It Works

- High frequency per muscle (3x/week)
- More practice with compounds
- Easy to schedule
- Excellent for building foundation

| **Monday** | | |
| | Squat | 3x8-10 |
| | Bench Press | 3x8-10 |
| | Barbell Row | 3x8-10 |
| | Overhead Press | 3x10-12 |
| | Bicep Curls | 2x12-15 |
| **Wednesday** | | |

## Progression

Add 5 lbs to lower body lifts and 2.5 lbs to upper body lifts each session when you complete all reps.`,

      content: `**Best For:**
- Intermediate to advanced (2+ years)
- Those with 5-6 gym days available
- Maximum volume and frequency goals

---

## Why It Works

- High frequency (2x per muscle per week)
- High volume per session
- Clear organization
- Most popular split for bodybuilding

---

## The Structure

| Day | Focus | Key Muscles |
|-----|-------|-------------|
| **Push A** | Heavy compounds | Chest, Shoulders, Triceps |
| **Pull A** | Heavy compounds | Back, Biceps, Rear Delts |
| **Legs A** | Heavy compounds | Quads, Hamstrings, Calves |
| **Push B** | Volume focus | Same muscles, different angles |
| **Pull B** | Volume focus | Same muscles, different angles |
| **Legs B** | Volume focus | Same muscles, different emphasis |

---

## Sample Push Day

| Exercise | Sets x Reps | Notes |
|----------|-------------|-------|
| Bench Press | 4x6-8 | Main compound |
| Overhead Press | 3x8-10 | Secondary compound |
| Incline DB Press | 3x10-12 | Upper chest focus |
| Lateral Raises | 4x15-20 | Side delt isolation |
| Tricep Dips | 3x8-12 | Compound tricep |
| Cable Pushdowns | 3x12-15 | Isolation finisher |

## The Truth

The bro split is often mocked as "suboptimal" because each muscle only gets hit once per week.

Science says 2x per week frequency is better for hypertrophy.

---

## But Here's the Thing

If you've been training for years and want maximum volume per session, or if it's the only split you'll stick to consistently, it can still work.

### When It Makes Sense

- Advanced lifters who need 15-20+ sets per muscle
- Those who enjoy destroying one muscle group per session
- People who've tried other splits and prefer this

### When It Doesn't

- Beginners (you don't need that much volume)
- People who miss gym days frequently
- Natural lifters who benefit from frequency

---

## The Compromise

If you like the bro split style, consider hitting each muscle 1.5x per week:

- Chest + Triceps
- Back + Biceps
- Shoulders + Legs (light)
- Arms + Rear Delts
- Legs (heavy)`,

      title: 'Choosing the Right Exercises',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Not all exercises are equal. Here's how to prioritize:

---

## Tier 1: Compound Movements (Build Your Foundation)

These should make up 60-70% of your training:

| Movement Pattern | Exercises |
|------------------|-----------|
| **Squat** | Back Squat, Front Squat, Goblet Squat |
| **Hinge** | Deadlift, RDL, Good Morning |
| **Horizontal Push** | Bench Press, DB Press, Push-Ups |
| **Horizontal Pull** | Barbell Row, DB Row, Cable Row |
| **Vertical Push** | Overhead Press, DB Shoulder Press |
| **Vertical Pull** | Pull-Ups, Lat Pulldown, Chin-Ups |

---

## Tier 2: Compound Accessories

- Lunges, leg press, RDLs
- Dips, incline press
- Face pulls, rear delt work
- Curl and tricep compound movements

## Tier 3: Isolation (Target Weaknesses)

- Lateral raises (for V-taper)
- Bicep curls (for arm peak)
- Tricep extensions (for arm size)
- Leg curls/extensions (for leg detail)
- Calf raises (for calf size)

---

      humorLevel: 'low',

## The Ranges

| Reps | Focus | Best For |
|------|-------|----------|
| **1-5** | Strength | Compounds (squat, bench, deadlift) |
| **6-12** | Hypertrophy | Most training—the sweet spot |
| **12-20+** | Metabolic/Pump | Small muscles, finishing sets |

---

## The Reality

Muscles grow across all rep ranges when taken close to failure.

The "6-12 for hypertrophy" rule is a guideline, not a law.

## Practical Application

| Exercise Type | Rep Range |
|---------------|-----------|
| **Compounds** | 5-10 reps |
| **Secondary compounds** | 8-12 reps |
| **Isolations** | 10-20 reps |

Mix it up within these guidelines for variety.`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `If you're not progressing, you're not growing. Here's how to ensure constant improvement:

---

## Method 1: Linear Progression (Beginners)

Add weight every session:

| Week | Bench Press |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | 135 x 3x8 |
| 2 | 140 x 3x8 |
| 3 | 145 x 3x8 |
| 4 | 150 x 3x8 |

Continue until you stall.

---

## Method 2: Double Progression (Intermediate)

Work within a rep range, increase weight when you hit the top:

| Week | Weight x Sets x Reps |
|------|---------------------|
| 1 | 185 x 3x8 |
| 2 | 185 x 3x9 |
| 3 | 185 x 3x10 |
| 4 | 190 x 3x8 (restart) |

---

## Method 3: Volume Progression (Advanced)

Keep weight same, add sets:

| Week | Sets |
|------|------|
| 1 | 3 sets |
| 2 | 4 sets |
| 3 | 5 sets |
| 4 | Deload |

---

## When You Stall

1. Check sleep and nutrition first
2. Deload (reduce volume/intensity for 1 week)
3. Try a different rep range or exercise variation
4. Accept that progress slows after the beginner phase`,

      content: `The best split is the one you'll actually do consistently. Here's the decision tree:

## How many days can you REALISTICALLY train per week?

| Days Available | Recommended Split |
|----------------|-------------------|
| **3 Days** | Full Body |
| **4 Days** | Upper/Lower |
| **5 Days** | Upper/Lower/Upper/Lower/Full or modified PPL |
| **6 Days** | PPL (Push/Pull/Legs 2x) |

---

## Quick Guide

### 3 Days → Full Body
- Best bang for buck with limited time
- Perfect for beginners

### 4 Days → Upper/Lower
- Great balance of volume and recovery
- Good for most intermediates

### 5 Days → Flexible
- More flexibility
- Good volume and frequency

### 6 Days → PPL
- Maximum volume and frequency
- Requires excellent recovery
- Advanced or great genetics

      content: `Here's what to do:

---

## Step 1: Choose Your Split

Based on your available training days and experience level. When in doubt, go with fewer days and build up.

## Step 2: Write It Down

Physically write or type your routine. Every exercise, sets, reps, and rest periods.

## Step 3: Track Every Workout

Use an app or notebook. Record weight x reps for every set.

## Step 4: Progress Each Session

Add weight, reps, or sets whenever possible. If you completed all prescribed reps, increase something next time.

## Step 5: Stick With It

**Minimum 8-12 weeks before changing programs.**

Program hopping is one of the biggest gains killers.

## Step 6: Deload When Needed

Every 4-6 weeks, take a lighter week. This isn't weakness—it's smart programming.
