      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `Orthognathic surgery repositions the jaw bones to correct skeletal discrepancies. Unlike implants or fillers, this moves the actual bone.

**What It Corrects:**
- Underbite (lower jaw protrudes)
- Overbite (upper jaw protrudes/lower jaw recedes)
- Open bite (teeth don't meet)
- Crossbite (jaw misalignment)
- Facial asymmetry
- Sleep apnea (functional)

**Who Performs It:**
Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons (OMFS), often in coordination with orthodontists.

**The Reality:**
- Major surgery with significant recovery
- Often covered by insurance (functional issues)
- 6-12 month recovery for final result
- Usually requires braces before and after
- Life-changing results when appropriate

**This Guide Covers:**
1. Types of jaw surgery
2. Determining if you need it
3. The treatment process
4. Costs and insurance
5. Recovery timeline
6. Risks and complications`,

      title: 'Types of Jaw Surgery',
      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `Different procedures for different problems:

**Upper Jaw (Maxillary) Surgery - Le Fort I**
- Moves upper jaw forward, backward, up, or down
- Corrects: Upper jaw underdevelopment, gummy smile, open bite
- Incision: Inside mouth (no visible scar)
- Recovery: 4-6 weeks soft diet

**Lower Jaw (Mandibular) Surgery - BSSO**
(Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy)
- Moves lower jaw forward or backward
- Corrects: Underbite, recessed lower jaw
- Incision: Inside mouth
- Recovery: 4-6 weeks, may require wiring/bands

**Double Jaw Surgery (Bimaxillary)**
- Moves both jaws simultaneously
- Most dramatic changes
- Corrects: Complex deformities, severe cases
- Longer surgery (4-6 hours)
- Most comprehensive result

**Genioplasty (Chin Surgery)**
- Often combined with jaw surgery
- Moves chin bone forward, backward, up, down
- Fine-tunes lower facial profile

**Comparison:**
| Surgery | Duration | Recovery | Impact |
|---------|----------|----------|--------|
| Upper only | 2-3 hrs | 4-6 weeks | Moderate |
| Lower only | 2-3 hrs | 4-6 weeks | Moderate |
| Double jaw | 4-6 hrs | 6-8 weeks | Dramatic |
| With genio | +1-2 hrs | Same | Enhanced |`,

      content: `Not everyone with jaw concerns needs surgery:

**Medical Indications (Insurance May Cover):**
- Difficulty chewing or biting
- Chronic jaw pain (TMJ)
- Sleep apnea
- Significant overbite (>9mm)
- Significant underbite
- Open bite affecting function
- Facial injury repair

**Aesthetic Indications:**
- Receding lower jaw (weak chin appearance)
- Protruding lower jaw
- Facial asymmetry
- Long face syndrome
- Short face syndrome
- Profile imbalance

**Who's NOT a Candidate:**
| Factor | Concern |
|--------|---------|
| Still growing (under 16-18) | Jaw not finished developing |
| Unrealistic expectations | Surgery can't create perfection |
| Poor general health | Surgery risk too high |
| Unwilling to wear braces | Pre-surgical orthodontics required |
| Body dysmorphia | May not resolve psychological issues |

**The Evaluation:**
1. 3D CT scan and X-rays
2. Dental models and bite analysis
3. Computer prediction of surgical result
4. Orthodontist and surgeon coordination
5. Psychological readiness assessment`,

      title: 'The Treatment Process',
      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `Jaw surgery isn't quick—expect a 2-3 year journey:

**Phase 1: Pre-Surgical Orthodontics (6-18 months)**
- Braces align teeth for surgical positioning
- Teeth may look "worse" temporarily
- Creating space for jaw movement
- Can't be skipped (teeth must fit after move)

**Phase 2: Surgical Planning**
- 3D imaging and computer modeling
- Custom surgical guides created
- Surgical hooks placed on braces
- Pre-op appointments and clearances

**Phase 3: Surgery**
- General anesthesia
- Hospital stay: 1-2 nights usually
- Duration: 2-6 hours depending on type
- Titanium plates and screws placed (permanent)

**Phase 4: Immediate Recovery (1-2 weeks)**
- Significant swelling
- Liquid diet
- May have jaw bands limiting movement
- Pain managed with medication
- Work/school not possible

**Phase 5: Initial Healing (6-8 weeks)**
- Gradual introduction of soft foods
- Swelling decreasing but present
- Limited jaw opening
- Can return to desk work at 2-3 weeks
- No heavy exercise

**Phase 6: Post-Surgical Orthodontics (6-12 months)**
- Fine-tuning bite
- Braces adjusted as healing progresses
- Retainers after braces removed`,

**Insurance Coverage:**
| Scenario | Coverage Likelihood |
|----------|---------------------|
| Documented sleep apnea | High |
| Significant functional issues | High |
| TMJ with documentation | Moderate |
| Purely cosmetic | None |

**Getting Insurance to Cover:**
1. Document functional problems (difficulty chewing, TMJ)
2. Sleep study if sleep apnea suspected
3. Orthodontist/surgeon letters of necessity
4. Preauthorization before surgery
5. May need appeal process

**Medical Tourism:**
| Country | Range | Notes |

      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `This recovery is significant. Don't underestimate it:

**Week 1:**
- Maximum swelling (chipmunk face)
- Liquid diet only (syringe or cup)
- May have surgical bands limiting opening
- Significant bruising possible
- Sleep sitting up
- Numbness in parts of face (normal)

**Weeks 2-3:**
- Swelling decreasing but still significant
- Soft, mushy foods possible
- Can return to desk work (remote preferred)
- Energy still low
- People will notice something happened

**Weeks 4-6:**
- Swelling mostly resolved
- Soft foods, expanding diet
- Feeling more normal
- May return to light exercise
- Social life resuming

**Months 2-3:**
- Eating normally (avoid very hard foods)
- Swelling mostly gone
- Numbness may persist
- Exercise restrictions lifting
- Result becoming visible

**Months 3-12:**
- Subtle swelling continues to resolve
- Numbness usually resolves (may take longer)
- Final result emerges
- Bones fully healed around 3-6 months
- Hardware permanent but unfelt

**Long-Term:**
- Permanent bone position
- Numbness can be permanent (5-10% of patients)
- Bite stability with proper retention
- May need touch-up orthodontics`,

      content: `Know the risks before committing:

**Common (Expected):**
| Issue | Details |
|-------|---------|
| Swelling | 100%, takes months to fully resolve |
| Numbness | Lower lip/chin common, usually temporary |
| Bruising | Variable, resolves in 2-3 weeks |
| Nasal congestion | Especially upper jaw surgery |
| Bite feels "off" initially | Normal, settles with healing |

**Uncommon:**
| Complication | Incidence |
|--------------|-----------|
| Permanent numbness | 5-10% (usually partial) |
| Infection | 1-5% |
| Relapse (movement back) | Variable with retention |
| TMJ issues (new or worsened) | Variable |
| Need for revision | <5% |

**Rare but Serious:**
- Significant blood loss (rare)
- Bad split (bone fractures wrong)
- Hardware issues requiring removal
- Asymmetric results
- Airway compromise

**Nerve Damage:**
The inferior alveolar nerve (feeling in lower lip/chin) runs through the lower jaw. It's stretched during BSSO. Most recover feeling, but some have permanent alteration. This is the most common permanent issue.`,
      warnings: [
        'Permanent numbness is a real possibility—accept this before surgery',

      humorLevel: 'low',
      content: `If you're considering jaw surgery:

**Phase 1: Assessment (Month 1-2)**
- Document your concerns (photos, symptoms)
- Research OMFS surgeons in your area
- Check if concerns are functional or cosmetic
- Consider insurance coverage potential

**Phase 2: Consultations (Month 2-4)**
- See 2-3 maxillofacial surgeons
- Get 3D imaging done
- Discuss surgical options
- Understand the full timeline
- Get cost estimates

**Phase 3: Decision**
- Weigh recovery time vs. benefit
- Assess insurance coverage
- Plan for time off work/school
- Coordinate orthodontist and surgeon
- Begin pre-surgical orthodontics if proceeding

**Phase 4: Pre-Op Preparation**
- Complete orthodontic preparation
- All medical clearances
- Plan recovery support
- Stock up on soft foods
- Arrange time off

**Phase 5: Surgery and Recovery**
- Follow all pre/post-op instructions
- Patience with swelling and numbness
- Attend all follow-up appointments
- Complete post-surgical orthodontics

**The Decision:**
Jaw surgery is a major undertaking with significant recovery. But for the right candidate, it's the only solution that addresses the skeletal cause of facial imbalance. Implants and fillers can only do so much—moving the bone creates fundamental change.`,
