## 🐛 What Was Broken (Root Cause Analysis)

### Primary Issue: CEP Panel Connection Error ✅ FIXED

**Symptom:** "Connection Error: Check server is running"

**Root Cause:** The CEP panel was incorrectly detecting `file://` protocol as "development mode" and trying to connect to `localhost:3847` instead of the production Railway backend.

**Fixed In:** Commit 5e47942 (2026-01-11)

**Solution:** Changed `getBackendUrl()` to default to production URL for all CEP panels.

---

### Secondary Issue: Website Login Not Working ✅ FIXED

**Symptom:** Website login at `https://spliceclips.com/login` was failing

**Root Causes (all fixed):**
1. ✅ Changed backend URL default from `api.spliceclips.com` to `splice-api-production.up.railway.app`
2. ✅ CORS already had `spliceclips.com` in whitelist
3. ✅ Fixed cookie settings consistency (all now use `sameSite: lax`)

**Files Fixed:**
- `splice-website/src/lib/csrf.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/usage/route.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`

**Status:** Fixed - deploy to Vercel to apply

---

### Potential Issue: Customer ID Format ⚠️ NEEDS VERIFICATION

**Your Customer ID should be:** `cus_beta_danny_isakov`
**Setup script used:** `beta_danny_isakov` (missing `cus_` prefix)

**Impact:** JWT token generation requires `cus_` prefix. If database has wrong format, login will fail.

**Action Needed:** Database check (see Troubleshooting section)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start - What You Should Do Now

### Option 1: Install Fixed CEP Plugin (Recommended)

**This should work now - the connection error is fixed!**

1. **Download the fixed version:**
   ```
   https://spliceclips.com/downloads/splice-v6.0.3-dev.zip
   ```

2. **Install with ZXPInstaller:**
   - Get ZXPInstaller: https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer/
   - Drag the `.zxp` file into ZXPInstaller
   - Wait for "Installation successful"

3. **Restart Premiere Pro**

4. **Open SPLICE panel:**
   - Go to `Window → Extensions → SPLICE - AI Video Editor`

5. **Login with your license key:**
   - Click "Login" button
   - Enter: `SPLICE-Y2Q9-6G9G-MFQE`
   - Click "Activate"

6. **If login succeeds:**
   - ✅ You're all set! Proceed to feature testing
   - See full testing guide: [DANNY_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md](DANNY_TESTING_INSTRUCTIONS.md)

7. **If login still fails:**
   - Continue to Troubleshooting section below

---

### Option 2: Force Production Backend (Quick Fix)

If the fixed version still has issues, manually force the production URL:

1. **Open Chrome debugger:**
   - Open Chrome browser
   - Navigate to: `http://localhost:8092`
   - Find "SPLICE" in the list and click it

2. **Run this command in the console:**
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('spliceBackendUrl', 'https://splice-api-production.up.railway.app');
   location.reload();
   ```

3. **Try logging in again** with your license key

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Check 1: Is the Backend Healthy?

Run this diagnostic script:
```bash
cd /Users/imorgado/SPLICE
./diagnose-connection.sh
```

**Expected output:**
- ✅ DNS resolution successful
- ✅ Network connectivity: OK
- ✅ HTTPS endpoint accessible
- ✅ SSL certificate valid
- ✅ Health check: Healthy
- ✅ Backend response time: ~0.2s

**If any check fails:**
- You may have a firewall blocking `*.railway.app`
- Try from a different network (mobile hotspot vs WiFi)
- Check with your IT department about network restrictions

---

### Check 2: Verify Your Customer ID Format

Ask the developer to run this database query:
```sql
SELECT
  key,
  stripe_customer_id,
  activated_at,
  is_active,
  tier
FROM license_keys
WHERE key = 'SPLICE-Y2Q9-6G9G-MFQE';
```

**Expected result:**
```
key: SPLICE-Y2Q9-6G9G-MFQE
stripe_customer_id: cus_beta_danny_isakov  ← Must start with "cus_"
activated_at: [timestamp]
is_active: true
tier: Team
```

**If `stripe_customer_id` is missing `cus_` prefix:**

The developer needs to run this fix:
```sql
UPDATE license_keys
SET stripe_customer_id = 'cus_beta_danny_isakov'
WHERE stripe_customer_id = 'beta_danny_isakov';
```

---

### Check 3: Collect Debug Logs

If login still fails after the above checks:

1. **Open Chrome debugger** at `http://localhost:8092`
2. **Click on "SPLICE"** in the list
3. **Open the Console tab**
4. **Try to login** in the SPLICE panel
5. **Look for these log entries:**
   - `[SPLICE FETCH]` - Shows network requests
   - `[SPLICE DEBUG]` - Shows detailed error info
   - `[SPLICE]` - Shows backend URL being used

6. **Take screenshots** of:
   - All error messages in console
   - Network tab showing failed requests
   - The SPLICE panel showing the error

7. **Send logs to:** isaacfmor@gmail.com

## 🌐 Website Login (NOW FIXED)

**All website authentication issues have been fixed!**

**What was fixed:**
1. ✅ Backend URL now defaults to Railway: `https://splice-api-production.up.railway.app`
2. ✅ CORS already had `spliceclips.com` in whitelist
3. ✅ Cookie settings now consistent (all use `sameSite: lax`)

**Files that were updated (7 files):**
- `splice-website/src/lib/csrf.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/usage/route.ts`
- `splice-website/src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`

**To deploy these changes:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix website authentication: correct backend URLs and cookie settings"
git push origin main
```

Vercel will auto-deploy and the website login should work!

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For Danny:
1. ✅ Install the fixed CEP plugin (v6.0.3-dev)
2. ✅ Try to login with your license key
3. ✅ If it works, proceed to feature testing
4. ❌ If it fails, collect debug logs and send to developer
5. ⏸️ Don't try website login - it's broken (dev needs to fix)

### For Developer:
1. ⚠️ Verify Danny's customer ID format in database (has `cus_` prefix?)
2. ✅ Website environment variables - code now has correct fallback
3. ✅ CORS whitelist already has spliceclips.com
4. ✅ Cookie sameSite consistency - all fixed to `lax`
5. ✅ Backend URL fallbacks - all 7 files fixed
6. ⏳ Deploy website changes to Vercel

---

**🔐 Bottom Line:** The CEP plugin should work now. If it doesn't, we need to check your customer ID format in the database and verify there are no network restrictions blocking Railway.
