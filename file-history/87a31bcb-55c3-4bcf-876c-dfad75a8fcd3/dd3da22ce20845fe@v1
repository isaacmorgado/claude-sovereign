      content: `**Dirty Bulk:** Eat everything, gain weight fast, get fat, have to cut forever.

**Lean Bulk:** Small surplus, gain muscle with minimal fat, stay relatively lean year-round.

**The Math:**
- You can gain ~0.25-0.5lb of muscle per week maximum (natural)
- Anything above that is fat
- A 200-300 calorie surplus is enough to maximize muscle growth

**Why Lean Bulk Wins:**
- Less time cutting later
- Stay looking good year-round
- Better insulin sensitivity
- Better hormone profile
- More sustainable long-term`,

      title: 'Setting Up Your Bulk',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Step 1: Establish Maintenance**
Track at stable weight for 1 week.

**Step 2: Add Surplus**
Add 200-300 calories to maintenance.

**Step 3: Set Macros**
- Protein: 0.8-1g/lb
- Fat: 0.4g/lb
- Carbs: remaining calories (prioritize around training)

**Step 4: Track Progress**
- Weigh daily, average weekly
- Target: 0.25-0.5lb gain per week
- Take progress photos monthly
- If gaining faster = add less calories

**Timeline:**
- Bulk for 3-6 months
- Then mini-cut or maintain
- Avoid bulking above 15-18% body fat`,

      content: `**Training Must Improve:**
A bulk without progressive overload is just getting fat.

**Track:**
- Weights going up
- Reps going up
- Volume tolerance increasing

**Eating Strategy:**
- Don't force-feed
- Spread protein across meals
- Carbs before and after training
- Eat slightly more on training days if wanted

**When to Adjust:**
- Not gaining after 2-3 weeks? Add 100-200 calories
- Gaining too fast (>0.5lb/week)? Reduce 100-200 calories
- Strength not improving? Check recovery/sleep`,

      title: 'Common Bulking Mistakes',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Mistake 1: Bulking Too Hard**
500+ calorie surplus = mostly fat gain. Muscle growth has limits.

**Mistake 2: Dirty Bulking**
"I need to eat everything" = you'll just get fat faster.

**Mistake 3: Not Training Hard Enough**
Eating in surplus without progressive overload = storing fat, not building muscle.

**Mistake 4: Bulking Too Long**
Getting above 18-20% body fat tanks hormone optimization and makes cutting harder.

**Mistake 5: Neglecting Protein**
Just because you're eating more doesn't mean you're hitting protein targets.

**Mistake 6: Eating Junk Because "Bulking"**
Food quality still matters for energy, recovery, and overall health.`,

      title: 'Your Bulking Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Month 1: Setup**
- Find maintenance
- Add 200-300 calories
- Track weight and lifts

**Months 2-4: Execute**
- Gain 0.25-0.5lb per week
- Progressive overload in gym
- Adjust calories based on scale

**Month 5-6: Evaluate**
- How much fat gained?
- How much stronger?
- Time for mini-cut?

**When to Stop Bulking:**
- Reaching 15-18% body fat
- After 4-6 months
- Strength gains stalling

**The Cycle:**
1. Lean bulk 4-6 months
2. Mini-cut 4-8 weeks (back to 12-14%)
3. Repeat

**The Payoff:**
Done correctly, you build muscle year-round while staying relatively lean. No more "bulk to 25% then cut for 6 months" cycles.`,
