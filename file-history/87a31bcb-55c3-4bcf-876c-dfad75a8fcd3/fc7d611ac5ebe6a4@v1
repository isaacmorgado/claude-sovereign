      content: `Elite cognition isn't just lifestyle—there's chemistry behind it.

Most "nootropics" are cope. But tools that work exist, and they massively amplify everything else you've built the foundation.

**The Rule for Enhancement Use:**
Enhancers don't give you discipline—they magnify what already exists.

- If your dopamine system is trash, they make you impulsive
- If your environment is clean, they make you lethal

**The Hierarchy:**
1. Fix sleep, stress, and nutrition first
2. Then consider enhancers
3. Cycle and don't depend on them

**If someone hasn't built the fundamentals, taking these is like installing a turbo on a blown engine.**`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Used for acute performance blocks.**

**Caffeine + L-Theanine**
- Smooth stimulation without anxiety spikes
- The most reliable nootropic stack
- Dose: 100-200mg caffeine + 100-200mg L-Theanine
- Best for: Working memory, focus before deep work
- Cycle: Don't daily dose (cycle 5 on/2 off)

**Alpha-GPC / CDP-Choline**
- Sharpens working memory
- Best before deep work
- Dose: 300-600mg
- Don't daily dose—cycle

**NAC + Acetyl-L-Tyrosine**
- Actual dopamine precursor support
- Great if you feel mentally flat
- NAC: 600-1200mg
- Tyrosine: 500-1000mg morning (empty stomach)`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Semax / Selank (NASAL peptides)**
- Increase Brain-Derived Neurotropic Factor
- Improve learning rate, task initiation, and calm focus
- Research chemical—not mainstream
- Effects build over 2-4 weeks

**Lions Mane**
- Upregulates Nerve Growth Factor
- Slower but structural long-term gains
- 500-1000mg daily
- Takes weeks to notice effects

**Cerebrolysin (advanced)**
- Insane neuroplasticity potential
- Prescription/research peptide
- Not for beginners

**Category B Note:**
These are for optimization after basics are dialed. If you're not sleeping 8 hours and eating properly, skip this category.`,

      title: 'Category C: "Stimulant Mashers" To Avoid',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Adderall, Vyvanse, Ritalin**
- Brando-branded crap that destroys baseline dopamine and wreck long-term executive function
- If someone hasn't built the fundamentals, taking these is like installing a turbo on a blown engine

**The Problem:**
- Creates dependence
- Crashes baseline dopamine with chronic use
- Masks underlying issues instead of fixing them
- Long-term cognitive decline with abuse

**The Exception:**
If you have diagnosed ADHD and work with a doctor, these can be appropriate. For everyone else, they're a trap.

**The Alternative:**
Fix dopamine naturally, optimize environment, use Category A compounds strategically.`,

      title: 'Your Enhancement Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Tier 1: Daily Foundation (Safe, Sustainable)**
- L-Theanine: 100-200mg (with caffeine or solo)
- Creatine: 3-5g daily
- Omega-3: 2-3g (high EPA)

**Tier 2: Work Blocks (Situational)**
- Caffeine + L-Theanine before deep work
- Alpha-GPC for cognitively demanding tasks
- Tyrosine on days you feel flat

**Tier 3: Advanced (Cycle Carefully)**
- Lions Mane for long-term neurogenesis
- Semax/Selank for learning phases
- Only after basics are perfect

**The Rule:**
Enhancers should enhance—not compensate.

If you need stimulants to function, you have a lifestyle problem, not a supplementation problem.

Fix sleep, stress, environment, and dopamine habits first. Then use these tools to go from good to great.`,
