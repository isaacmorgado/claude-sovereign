      content: `Your testosterone levels follow your body fat, micronutrients, and energy availability.

**The Biggest Mistake:**
Guys oscillate between starving themselves and dirty bulking. Both destroy hormones for different reasons.

**Starvation Mode:**
- Severe calorie deficit = body shuts down "non-essential" functions
- Testosterone is "non-essential" when you're starving
- Your body prioritizes survival over reproduction

**Dirty Bulk Mode:**
- High body fat = high aromatase activity
- Aromatase converts testosterone to estrogen
- Result: high estrogen, suppressed testosterone

**The Sweet Spot:**
Maintain a slight surplus or maintenance calories with high micronutrient density.`,

      title: 'Optimal Zone for Testosterone',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Target: 10-15% body fat**

Leaner than that, you can maintain high T if your diet is clean and high in micronutrients (ignore the cope about 10% being "too low").

Above 15%, aromatase increases and testosterone drops.

**The Math:**
- Below 10%: T can drop if calories too low
- 10-15%: Optimal zone for most men
- 15-20%: Aromatase starts converting T to estrogen
- 20%+: Significant hormonal dysfunction

**The Priority:**
If body fat is high, fix that before worrying about supplements or protocols.

You fix that before you fix hormones.`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**1. Eat Enough Fat: 60-100g Daily**
Cholesterol leads to testosterone. Fat is the building block.

Depending on size:
- Minimum 60g fat daily
- Up to 100g for larger men

**2. Prioritize Red Meats**
Beef, eggs, salmon—these are rich in zinc, B vitamins, omega-3s.

**3. Avoid Seed Oils Completely**
Inflammatory and anti-androgenic.

Replace with:
- Olive oil
- Avocado oil
- Butter
- Coconut oil

**4. Zero Sugar Binges**
Spikes insulin → crashes T short-term.

**5. Maintain Slight Surplus or Maintenance**
Severe deficits tank hormones fast.

**6. Fix Gut Health**
Bloating, inflammation, and food sensitivities can indirectly tank libido and mood.`,

      title: 'Micronutrients That Matter',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**The Essential Stack:**

**Zinc**
- Direct testosterone precursor
- Lost through sweat (athletes need more)
- Food sources: Red meat, oysters, pumpkin seeds
- Supplement: 15-30mg daily if not getting from food

**Magnesium**
- Involved in 300+ enzymatic reactions including T production
- Most people are deficient
- Supplement: 200-400mg glycinate before bed

**Vitamin D**
- Actually a hormone, not a vitamin
- Low D = low T (strongly correlated)
- Supplement: 2000-5000 IU daily

**B Complex**
- Energy metabolism and hormone production
- Get from red meat or supplement

**Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)**
- Reduces inflammation
- Supports cell membrane health
- 2-3g fish oil daily`,

      content: `**Step 1: Fix Body Fat First**
If above 15%, prioritize fat loss before anything else.

**Step 2: Hit Macros**
- Protein: 1g per lb bodyweight
- Fat: 0.4-0.5g per lb (minimum 60g)
- Carbs: Fill remaining calories

**Step 3: Food Quality**
- Prioritize whole foods
- Red meat 3-4x per week
- Remove seed oils
- Minimize processed foods

**Step 4: Supplement Gaps**
- Vitamin D: 2000-5000 IU
- Magnesium: 200-400mg
- Zinc: 15-30mg (if not eating red meat regularly)
- Omega-3: 2-3g EPA/DHA

**The Compounding Effect:**
These changes take 4-8 weeks to show up in blood work. Be patient and consistent.

A guy eating 2500 calories of steak, eggs, and vegetables will have better hormones than a guy eating 2500 calories of protein bars and seed oils.`,
