      content: `Most blood tests don't tell you anything about how you look. These are the markers that directly influence fat, fullness, pumps, energy, mood, and recovery—the ones that actually change your appearance.

There are 5 categories of toxins that silently sabotage your aesthetics:
1. Plastics & Microplastics
2. Cheap Skin & Hair Products
3. Heavy Metals in Cookware
4. Tap Water Contaminants
5. Air Quality & Mold

**The Problem:**
You can do everything else right—sleep, training, nutrition—and still look worse than you should because of environmental exposure.

**The Good News:**
Simple swaps fix 95% of this.`,

      title: '1. Plastics & Microplastics (Water + Food Contact)',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Plastic literally leaches xenoestrogens into your system.**

These increase estrogen storage, worsen skin, and mess with hormones.

**The Problem:**
- BPA and phthalates mimic estrogen
- Heating plastic releases more chemicals
- Microplastics accumulate in tissues
- Affects testosterone, thyroid, and fat storage

**ROI:** Less bloat, better testosterone, clearer skin.

**The Fix:**
- Switch all water to glass or stainless steel
- Never microwave food in plastic
- Replace plastic Tupperware with glass
- Don't drink from heated plastic bottles (gym, car, sun)

**This is 95% of the ROI.** The other swaps help, but plastic is the biggest offender.`,

      title: '2. Cheap Skin & Hair Products',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Anything artificial/fragrance-heavy destroys your skin barrier and introduces endocrine disruptors.**

**The Problem:**
- Fragrances = undisclosed chemicals
- Parabens = endocrine disruptors
- SLS/SLES = strips skin barrier
- Deodorant aluminum = controversial but concerning

**ROI:** Better skin, water retention, fewer breakouts.

**The Fix:**
- Use fragrance-free or low-tox grooming products
- Switch deodorant to aluminum-free
- Smoother skincare formulas (no synthetic fragrance)
- Avoid cheap body washes that strip your skin microbiome

**Fragrances = the worst offenders** (especially body sprays)

Read ingredient labels. If it has "fragrance" or "parfum" listed, it's a blend of unknown chemicals.`,

      title: '3. Heavy Metals in Cookware',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Non-stick pans degrade and release microplastics into your food.**

**The Problem:**
- PTFE (Teflon) releases toxic fumes when overheated
- Scratched non-stick = particles in your food
- Cheap cookware leaches aluminum
- These accumulate over time

**ROI:** Reduced inflammation + improved gut health.

**The Fix:**
- Switch to stainless steel or cast iron
- Only use non-stick for low-heat cooking
- Replace damaged/scratched non-stick pans immediately
- Avoid aluminum cookware for acidic foods

**Priority:** Replace any scratched Teflon pans first.

Cast iron is cheap, lasts forever, and actually adds iron to your food (a plus for many men).`,

      title: '4. Tap Water Contaminants',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Unfiltered tap water contains chlorine, fluoride, microplastics, and sometimes pharmaceutical residue.**

**The Problem:**
- Chlorine disrupts gut microbiome
- Fluoride affects thyroid function
- Microplastics are everywhere now
- Heavy metals vary by location

**ROI:** Better digestion, clearer skin, less water retention.

**The Fix:**
- Get a Berkey-style countertop filter or Brita Elite minimum
- Showerhead filter helps if you have hard water
- Know your local water quality (check EWG database)

**The Minimum:**
A basic carbon filter removes chlorine and improves taste. A reverse osmosis system removes almost everything.

If you're drinking unfiltered tap water, you're drinking whatever your pipes and treatment plant put in it.`,

      id: 'air',
      title: '5. Air Quality & Mold',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Bad air = lower testosterone, worse sleep, more inflammation.**

**The Problem:**
- Indoor air is often more polluted than outdoor
- Mold exposure causes chronic inflammation
- Poor air quality disrupts sleep
- VOCs from furniture, paint, cleaning products

**ROI:** Better sleep, sharper facial features, improved recovery.

**The Fix:**
- Keep your room ventilated
- Use an air purifier (HEPA filter)
- Avoid candles with synthetic fragrance
- Sun-dry sheets weekly
- Check for mold if you have unexplained symptoms

**Signs of Mold Exposure:**
- Chronic fatigue
- Brain fog
- Skin issues
- Respiratory problems
- Symptoms worse at home

If you suspect mold, get it tested. It's more common than people think.`,

1. Stop microwaving plastic
2. Switch to glass/stainless water bottle
3. Replace scratched non-stick pans

**Tier 2: Do This Month**
4. Switch to fragrance-free products
5. Get a water filter
6. Get a small air purifier for bedroom

**Tier 3: When You Can**
7. Replace plastic food storage with glass
8. Audit cleaning products
9. Check home for mold

**The 80/20:**
Plastic + fragrance products cause 80% of the issues. Fix those first.

Don't overthink it—just swap these and you're done. The goal isn't perfection, it's removing the biggest offenders.`,
