      content: `Most guys sleep in a room that actively fights their biology—bright lights, hot rooms, noise, EMF, stimulants.

Your environment should be designed so your physiology has no choice but to wind down.

**The 4 Pillars of Sleep Environment:**
1. Temperature (your #1 sleep lever)
2. Light (your circadian "on/off switch")
3. Sound (noise control)
4. Air quality (often overlooked)

Get these right and sleep quality improves automatically.`,

      title: '1. Temperature (Your #1 Sleep Lever)',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Target: 65-68°F (18-20°C)**

Use a fan or AC. Cold room, warm blankets.

Your core temperature must drop to fall asleep—this single variable fixes insomnia for 70%+ of people.

**Setup:**
- Thermostat to 65-68°F at night
- Breathable sheets (cotton, bamboo, linen)
- Avoid heavy synthetic blankets that trap heat
- Consider sleeping with less clothing

**Pro Tip:** A warm shower 1 hour before bed causes a rebound cooling effect that helps initiate sleep.

If you're waking up sweating or kicking off blankets, your room is too hot.`,

      title: '2. Light (Your Circadian "On/Off Switch")',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Zero overhead lights after sunset. Use lamps only.**

If you need to navigate at night, use red light only.

This is how you protect melatonin and actually sleep deeply.

**Rules:**
- No LED alarm clocks (or cover them)
- Blackout curtains or sleep mask
- No standby lights from electronics
- Red/amber night lights only if needed

**Blue light = daytime signal.**
**Warm/red light = nighttime signal.**

Use salt lamps, warm LEDs, or red bulbs for the last 1-2 hours before bed.

Your bedroom should be **dark enough that you can't see your hand** when lights are off.`,

      title: '3. Noise & Sound Control',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**White noise machine or fan. Earplugs if you live with loud people.**

Your nervous system cannot downshift if it's being stimulated.

**The Problem:**
Even tiny noises spike cortisol and fragment sleep—you won't remember waking, but your sleep quality suffers.

**Solutions:**
- White noise machine or fan (consistent background noise)
- Earplugs (if partner snores or street noise)
- No music or podcasts in bed—silence only

**Key Rule:**
Bed = sleep only (no scrolling, no content consumption).

Your brain should associate your bed with exactly one thing: unconsciousness.`,

      title: '4. Air Quality & Devices',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Huge for sleep depth and facial aesthetics.**

Low oxygen = restless sleep. Better air improves oxygen saturation, which leads to deeper sleep, which also leads to better recovery and fullness.

**Air Quality Setup:**
- Use an air purifier (HEPA filter)
- Crack a window slightly for airflow
- Avoid candles/incense—they pollute air
- Keep plants out of bedroom at night (they release CO2)

**Device Rules:**
- No TV in the bedroom
- Charge phone outside the room
- If you absolutely must keep it near you, put it in airplane mode

Your phone is the fastest way to destroy melatonin and keep your brain active.

**Pre-Bed Bathroom Setup (Elite-Level Biohack):**
- Warm shower 1 hour before bed (drops core temp afterward)
- Dim lighting in the bathroom
- No mirrors—avoid looking at your face at night (it spikes alertness)

This creates a perfect downward cortisol curve.`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Tonight:**
- Set thermostat to 65-68°F
- Remove or cover any light sources in bedroom
- Put phone in another room or airplane mode

**This Week:**
- Get blackout curtains or a sleep mask
- Set up white noise (fan or machine)
- Switch to lamps only after sunset

**Investment Priorities:**
1. Blackout solution ($20-50)
2. White noise machine or fan ($20-40)
3. Air purifier if allergies/pollution ($50-150)
4. Quality bedding if yours traps heat

**The Goal:**
Your bedroom should feel like a cave—cool, dark, quiet. When you walk in, your body should automatically start winding down.

Better air = better sleep = sharper face/better recovery = better aesthetics.`,
