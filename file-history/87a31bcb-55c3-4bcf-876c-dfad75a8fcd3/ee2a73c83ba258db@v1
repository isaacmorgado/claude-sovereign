      content: `**Best For:**
- Intermediate-Advanced lifters
- Those who can train 6 days/week
- People who love being in the gym
- Those wanting maximum volume

**The Science:**
- Each muscle hit 2x per week
- Maximum volume per muscle group
- More exercise variety
- Muscles fully recover before next session

**The Trade-off:**
- Requires 6 days of commitment
- More total gym time
- Recovery can be challenging
- Not for beginners

**Warning:**
This is a lot of volume. If you're not sleeping 8+ hours and eating 1g/lb protein, you won't recover properly.`,

      title: 'Adding Variation',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Option 1: Same Workouts Twice**
- Push 1 = Push 2
- Simpler, easier to track progress
- Good for beginners to PPL

**Option 2: Heavy/Light Split**
- Push 1: Heavy (4-8 reps)
- Push 2: Light (10-15 reps)
- Better for advanced lifters
- More exercise variety

**Sample Heavy/Light:**

**Push 1 (Heavy):**
Bench 4×4-6, OHP 4×6-8, Dips 3×6-8, Lateral Raise 3×10-12, Close Grip Bench 3×8-10

**Push 2 (Light):**
Incline DB 4×10-12, Machine Press 3×12-15, Cable Flye 3×12-15, Lateral Raise 4×15-20, Tricep Pushdown 3×12-15

**Rotate Exercises:**
- Can swap similar movements week to week
- Keep main compounds consistent
- Variety in accessories is fine`,

      content: `**This Split Demands:**
- 8+ hours sleep (non-negotiable)
- 1g protein per lb bodyweight
- Proper pre/post workout nutrition
- At least 1 full rest day

**Signs You're Under-Recovering:**
- Strength going down
- Always tired
- No motivation
- Getting sick often
- Joints aching

**If You Can't Recover:**
- Drop to Upper/Lower (4 days)
- Sleep more
- Eat more
- Add deload weeks more often

**Deload Protocol:**
- Every 4-6 weeks (more frequent than other splits)
- 50% weight, same exercises
- Don't skip deloads`,

      content: `**Prerequisites:**
- 6+ months of consistent training
- Can commit to 6 days per week
- Sleep and nutrition are dialed in

**Week 1: Setup**
- Start with moderate weights
- Learn the movement patterns
- Don't ego lift

**Weeks 2-4: Execute**
- Follow progression protocol
- Track everything
- Monitor recovery

**Week 5: Deload**
- 50% weight
- Active recovery

**Weeks 6+: Continue**
- Progress and evaluate
- Adjust volume as needed

**Time Per Session:** 60-75 minutes

**The Payoff:**
Maximum volume, maximum frequency, maximum results—if you can recover from it. This is for people who love training and want to spend 6+ hours per week in the gym.

If that's not you, Upper/Lower is more efficient.`,
