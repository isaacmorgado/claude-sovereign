      content: `Your cardiovascular markers determine how well your body can sustain hard training, stay lean, and recover without fatigue spillover.

**Poor blood pressure or cholesterol routinely lowers performance, sleep quality, pump intensity, and inflammation control.**

**What Good CV Health Gets You:**
- Better pumps (improved blood flow)
- Faster recovery between sessions
- More capacity for high-volume training
- Reduced inflammation
- Better sleep quality

**You can't reach elite aesthetics with poor cardiovascular health**—your body simply won't perform or recover at the level required.`,

      title: 'Blood Pressure',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Key Markers to Track:**

**Blood Pressure**
- Ideal: 115-125 / 70-80
- Unideal: Above 130/80

**What High BP Causes:**
- Reduced recovery, higher inflammation (water pumps)
- Headaches and fatigue
- Long-term organ damage
- Worse sleep quality

**Resting Heart Rate**
- Ideal: 45-60 bpm
- Elite: 45-48 bpm
- Below 40 bpm usually indicates endurance adaptations

**What RHR Tells You:**
Low RHR = good cardiovascular conditioning
High RHR = potential stress, poor fitness, or overtraining

Under 40 bpm usually indicates significant endurance adaptations (don't benefit unless already at endurance athlete level).`,

      id: 'lipids',
      title: 'Lipid Markers',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**apoB**
- Ideal: <80 mg/dL
- High apoB + high LDL-P = increased cardiovascular risk

**LDL-P / HDL Ratio**
- Aim for low LDL-P and high HDL
- HDL > 50 mg/dL ideal
- Low LDL + cardio improves body composition

**Why These Matter for Aesthetics:**
- Better blood flow = better pumps
- Lower systemic inflammation = tighter look
- Better sleep quality from improved autonomic balance
- More capacity for high-volume training (advanced / bigger splits)

**When These Allow for Better Training:**
- 45s-60s rest between sets (improved recovery)
- Higher volume without fatigue
- Better nutrient delivery to muscles`,

      title: 'How to Improve These Markers',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**For Blood Pressure:**
- Daily Zone 2 cardio (20-30 minutes)
- Reduce seed oils
- Increase olive oil, avocado, macadamia
- Add fish oil (1-2g EPA/DHA daily)
- Limit alcohol
- Manage stress (cortisol raises BP)
- Ensure adequate potassium intake

**For Lipid Profile:**
- Every 1% body fat drop improves BP and apoB
- Zone 2 cardio most effective
- Omega-3 fatty acids
- Reduce processed foods
- Add fiber (soluble fiber binds cholesterol)

**For Resting Heart Rate:**
- Consistent Zone 2 cardio training
- Improve sleep quality
- Reduce chronic stress
- Avoid overtraining`,

      title: 'Your Cardiovascular Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Test These:**
- Blood pressure (home monitor, $20-40)
- Resting heart rate (morning, before getting up)
- Lipid panel with apoB (blood test)

**Minimum Weekly Cardio:**
- 3x20-30 min Zone 2 (conversational pace)
- Benefits: Improved recovery, better BP, enhanced fat oxidation

**Daily Habits:**
- 10-15 min walking
- Stress management (see cortisol guide)
- 7-9 hours sleep

**Supplementation:**
- Omega-3: 1-2g EPA/DHA daily
- Magnesium: 200-400mg (supports heart rhythm)
- CoQ10: 100-200mg (optional, supports mitochondria)

**The Connection:**
Cardiovascular health is the foundation for training capacity. Without it, you can't sustain the volume and intensity needed for optimal physique development.

A guy with great CV markers can train harder, recover faster, and maintain definition more easily than a guy with poor markers at the same body composition.

Don't neglect cardio in favor of lifting only.`,
