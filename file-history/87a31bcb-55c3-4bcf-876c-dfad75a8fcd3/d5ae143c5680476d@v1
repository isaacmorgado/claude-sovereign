But here's what nobody tells you: **most guys fail not because they don't know what to do, but because their mindset is cooked from day one.**

They're either:
- Paralyzed by analysis (reading guides instead of taking action)
- Expecting overnight results (then quitting after 2 weeks)
- Comparing themselves to genetic outliers (and feeling defeated)
- Looking for shortcuts (spoiler: there aren't any)

This guide is about fixing that before you waste months spinning your wheels.`,

      content: `You've bookmarked 47 articles. You've saved 200 Instagram posts. You've downloaded 12 PDFs. You've done exactly **zero** actual work.

**This ain't it, chief.**

The perfect routine doesn't exist. There's no secret combination of products and exercises that will unlock chad-tier genetics. There's just consistent effort over time.

Here's the brutal truth: a mediocre plan executed consistently beats a perfect plan you never start.

**Action Step:** Pick ONE thing from this app to improve. Just one. Do it for 30 days before adding anything else.`,

Real change takes **months to years**, depending on what you're working on:

| Change | Timeline |
|--------|----------|
| Better skin (routine) | 6-12 weeks |
| Body recomposition | 3-6 months |
| Posture improvement | 3-6 months |
| Hair regrowth (minox) | 6-12 months |
| Mewing (adults) | 1-2+ years |

**The guys who win are the ones who forget about results and just lock in on the process.**

Think about it: if you had started 6 months ago, you'd already be there. You didn't. So start now and stop checking daily.`,

- Won the genetic lottery
- Have professional lighting in every photo
- Are on gear and won't admit it
- Use filters/editing
- Got surgery and claim "just mewing bro"

**This is NPC behavior.**

Here's a better frame: you're not trying to become someone else. You're trying to mog your past self. That's it.

Your only competition is the guy you were 6 months ago. If he'd be jealous of where you are now, you're winning.`,

The internet is full of people trying to sell you things you don't need:
- Miracle supplements that do nothing
- Expensive gadgets that collect dust
- "Secret" techniques that are just repackaged basics

**Here's what actually works:**
1. Sleep 7-9 hours
2. Eat enough protein
3. Lift weights
4. Use sunscreen
5. Stay lean
6. Groom yourself

That's 90% of it. Everything else is optimization on top of this foundation. If you're not doing these six things consistently, nothing else matters.`,

      content: `You miss one gym session and think "welp, the whole week is ruined."
You eat one bad meal and say "might as well order pizza for the rest of the week."
You skip your skincare once and abandon the routine entirely.

**This is self-sabotage with extra steps.**

Progress isn't linear. Life happens. The goal isn't perfection—it's **consistency over time**.

Missing one day means nothing. Missing one day, then letting it spiral into one week, then one month? That's the killer.

**The rule:** If you miss, just get back on track the next opportunity. No guilt, no drama. Just reset and continue.`,

You want Botox but you've never worn sunscreen.
You're considering hair transplants but you sleep 5 hours a night.

**You're skipping chapters, my guy.**

Here's the priority order:
1. **Free tier:** Sleep, hydration, basic hygiene, mewing, posture
2. **Low cost ($20-50/mo):** Gym, skincare basics, grooming tools
3. **Medium cost ($50-200/mo):** Supplements, better products, minoxidil
4. **High cost ($500+):** Treatments, procedures, surgery

Don't level skip. The expensive stuff doesn't work if the foundation is garbage.

Surgery on a 25% body fat face is like putting a spoiler on a Honda Civic. Fix the car first.`,

      content: `Here's what the successful guys do:

**1. Accept the timeline**
You're playing a 1-2 year game minimum. Accept that now or quit.

**2. Build systems, not goals**
"I want a better jawline" is a goal. "I chew mastic gum for 20 minutes after every meal" is a system. Systems win.

**3. Track ruthlessly**
Take monthly photos. Same lighting, same angle, same expression. This is the only objective measure.

**4. Iterate slowly**
Add one new thing every 4-6 weeks. Not five things at once. You need to know what's actually working.

**5. Focus on the 80/20**
20% of actions produce 80% of results. For most guys:
- Getting lean (diet + exercise)
- Skincare (cleanser, moisturizer, sunscreen)
- Grooming (hair, brows, facial hair)

**Nail these before anything else.**`,
