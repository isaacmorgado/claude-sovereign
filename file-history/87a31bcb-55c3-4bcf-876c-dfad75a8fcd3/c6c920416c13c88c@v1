      content: `Forget the fancy programs. Muscle growth comes from three things:

1. **Progressive Overload** - Doing more over time
2. **Sufficient Volume** - Enough sets per muscle
3. **Recovery** - Sleep, nutrition, rest

**The Hierarchy:**
1. Consistency (showing up)
2. Progressive overload (getting stronger)
3. Volume (enough work)
4. Exercise selection (mostly doesn't matter)
5. Program specifics (matters least)

**The Reality:**
Any program works if you progressively overload and recover properly. The "best" program is the one you'll actually do consistently.`,

      title: 'Progressive Overload',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**The #1 driver of muscle growth.**

If you're not progressively overloading, you're not growing. Period.

**Ways to Progressively Overload:**
1. Add weight (primary method)
2. Add reps (same weight, more reps)
3. Add sets (more total volume)
4. Better form (more tension on target muscle)

**Practical Application:**
- Track every workout
- Try to beat last session (even by 1 rep)
- When you hit rep target, add weight
- Example: 3x8-12 → hit 3x12 → add 5lbs → back to 3x8

**The Mistake:**
Most guys don't track. They do the same weight for months and wonder why they're not growing.

**Track. Beat. Progress.**`,

      id: 'volume',
      title: 'Volume & Frequency',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Volume = Sets × Reps × Weight**

More specifically: **Hard sets per muscle per week** is what matters.

**Minimum Effective Volume:**
- 10-12 sets per muscle per week (beginners)
- 15-20 sets per muscle per week (intermediate)
- 20-25 sets per muscle per week (advanced)

**Frequency:**
How often you hit each muscle:
- 2x per week minimum for most muscles
- Spreading volume across the week > cramming into one day

**Example:**
- 16 sets of chest per week
- Better as 8 sets × 2 days than 16 sets × 1 day

**Why Frequency Matters:**
- Muscle protein synthesis peaks 24-48 hours post-workout
- Hitting muscle 2x per week = more growth signals`,

      title: 'Recovery is Where Growth Happens',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**You don't grow in the gym. You grow recovering from the gym.**

**Recovery Requirements:**
- **Sleep:** 7-9 hours (non-negotiable)
- **Protein:** 0.8-1g per pound bodyweight
- **Rest Days:** 2-3 per week minimum
- **Stress Management:** High cortisol = poor recovery

**Signs of Under-Recovery:**
- Strength going down
- Always feeling tired
- Getting sick more often
- Joints aching
- No motivation to train

**Signs of Good Recovery:**
- Strength trending up
- Energy is good
- Looking forward to training
- Pumps feel good

**The Mistake:**
Training 7 days a week with 5 hours of sleep doesn't make you hardcore—it makes you small.`,

      content: `**Step 1: Pick a Program**
See specific split guides (Full Body, Upper/Lower, PPL).

**Step 2: Track Everything**
- App or notebook
- Exercises, sets, reps, weight
- How you felt

**Step 3: Focus on Getting Stronger**
- Progressive overload every session
- Small wins add up
- Strength = size (for naturals)

**Step 4: Prioritize Recovery**
- Sleep 7-9 hours
- Hit protein targets
- Take rest days seriously

**The Mindset:**
Training is simple. Not easy, but simple.

1. Show up consistently
2. Try to beat last session
3. Eat enough protein
4. Sleep enough
5. Be patient

Do this for years. That's the secret.`,
