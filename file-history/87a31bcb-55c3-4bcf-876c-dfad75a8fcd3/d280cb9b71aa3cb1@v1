      content: `You're not as fat as you think—you're probably just holding water.

**Common Causes of Bloating/Puffiness:**
- High sodium intake
- Low water intake (paradoxically)
- High carb intake (glycogen holds water)
- Poor sleep
- High cortisol/stress
- Food sensitivities
- Alcohol
- Hormonal fluctuations

**The Reality:**
2-8 lbs of your "weight" is water. This can make you look dramatically different day-to-day without any actual fat change.

**The Goal:**
Reduce unnecessary water retention for a tighter, more defined appearance.`,

      title: 'The 24-72 Hour Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**For a quick debloat (before event, photoshoot, etc.):**

**Day 1-2:**
- Increase water intake to 1 gallon+
- Reduce sodium to <1500mg
- Cut carbs to <50g
- No alcohol
- No dairy (if sensitive)
- No artificial sweeteners

**Day 3 (Event Day):**
- Moderate water (normal intake)
- Very low sodium
- Low carbs until event
- Small carb meal 2-3 hours before (optional pump)

**What Happens:**
- High water + low sodium = body flushes water
- Low carbs = glycogen depletes, releasing water
- Reduced inflammation = less puffiness

**Warning:**
This is for short-term aesthetics. Don't do this constantly—it's not sustainable or healthy long-term.`,

      title: 'Daily Anti-Bloat Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**For ongoing reduction in water retention:**

**Hydration:**
- Drink 3-4L water daily (more = body holds less)
- Add electrolytes (paradoxically reduces retention)
- Front-load water earlier in day

**Sodium:**
- Keep consistent (not too low, not too high)
- Avoid huge spikes (processed foods, restaurant meals)
- 2000-3000mg is fine for active people

**Carbs:**
- Moderate, consistent intake
- Avoid huge swings (low all week, binge on weekend)
- Each gram of carb holds 3-4g water

**Sleep:**
- 7-9 hours
- Poor sleep = cortisol = water retention

**Stress:**
- Manage cortisol (see cortisol guide)
- High stress = puffy face`,

      title: 'Debloating Supplements',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Actually Work:**

**Dandelion Root**
- Natural diuretic
- 500-1500mg daily
- Don't use long-term

**Potassium**
- Balances sodium
- Get from food (bananas, potatoes) or supplement
- 3500-4700mg daily total

**Magnesium**
- Reduces water retention
- 200-400mg glycinate before bed

**Vitamin B6**
- Mild diuretic effect
- 50-100mg daily
- Especially helpful for hormonal bloating

**What Doesn't Work:**
- "Detox teas" (just make you poop)
- Most fat burners
- Waist trainers (lol)

**Warning:**
Don't abuse diuretics. They can cause electrolyte imbalances and are not sustainable.`,

      title: 'Identify Your Triggers',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Common Bloating Triggers:**

**Dairy**
- Lactose intolerance is common
- Try eliminating for 1 week

**Gluten**
- Some people are sensitive (not celiac)
- Try eliminating for 1 week

**Artificial Sweeteners**
- Sugar alcohols especially (sorbitol, maltitol)
- Can cause gas and bloating

**FODMAPs**
- Fermentable carbs
- Beans, onions, garlic, certain fruits
- May cause bloating in sensitive individuals

**Carbonated Drinks**
- Literally putting gas in your stomach
- Switch to flat water

**How to Identify:**
1. Eliminate suspected trigger for 7-14 days
2. Note if bloating improves
3. Reintroduce and see if it returns
4. Keep a food diary

**The 80% Rule:**
For most people, the main triggers are: too much sodium, too little water, inconsistent carb intake, poor sleep, and stress.`,

      title: 'Your Debloating Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**This Week (Baseline):**
- [ ] Increase water to 3-4L daily
- [ ] Track sodium (aim for consistency)
- [ ] Sleep 7-9 hours
- [ ] Note which meals cause bloating

**Ongoing:**
- [ ] Keep carb intake consistent (no huge swings)
- [ ] Limit alcohol
- [ ] Manage stress/cortisol
- [ ] Consider eliminating dairy/gluten trial

**Before Events:**
- [ ] 48-72 hour protocol (high water, low sodium, low carb)
- [ ] Reduce water day-of slightly
- [ ] Small carb meal before for pump (optional)

**Supplement Stack (Optional):**
- Magnesium: 200-400mg nightly
- Potassium: From food primarily
- Dandelion root: Short-term use only

**The Payoff:**
Consistent hydration + consistent sodium + good sleep + managed stress = you'll naturally hold less water and look tighter day-to-day.

Most of the variation in how you look is water, not fat. Control the water, control your appearance.`,
