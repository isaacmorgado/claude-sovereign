      content: `Your hormones respond to your lifestyle—testosterone rises in men who live in a way that signals strength, capability, and low stress.

**The Signal:**
When your body perceives:
- Physical capability (strength training)
- Resource abundance (good nutrition)
- Low threat (managed stress)
- Social status (confidence, achievement)

...it produces more testosterone.

When it perceives the opposite, testosterone drops.

This isn't broscience—it's how the endocrine system evolved.`,

      title: 'Training Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Rule:** 4-6 days per week of resistance training

**What Boosts Testosterone:**
- Prioritize heavy compounds + hypertrophy
- Squats, deadlifts, bench, rows, overhead press
- Progressive overload over time

**What Kills Testosterone:**
- Avoid chronic high-intensity cardio—raises cortisol and suppresses testosterone
- Overtraining without recovery
- Undereating while training hard

**The Protocol:**
- Martial arts 1-2x weekly (optional but great for movement + confidence boost)
- 4-5 lifting sessions per week
- 1-2 rest days minimum

**The Signal:**
Your body reads resistance training as "this organism needs to be strong." It responds by optimizing hormones for strength and muscle.`,

      title: 'Sunlight & Light Exposure',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**10-20 minutes morning sun boosts testosterone and circadian rhythm.**

Vitamin D3 if you're indoors or in low-light seasons.

**Why It Matters:**
- Vitamin D is actually a hormone precursor
- Low Vitamin D = low testosterone (strongly correlated)
- Morning light also sets circadian rhythm for optimal hormone timing

**The Protocol:**
- Get outside within 1 hour of waking
- 10-20 minutes of direct sunlight
- No sunglasses (light needs to hit your eyes)
- Supplement D3 (2000-5000 IU) if sun isn't available

**The Signal:**
Light exposure tells your body "it's daytime, be active and productive." This aligns all downstream hormone cascades.`,

      title: 'Sexual Discipline',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**The Facts:**
- Excessive porn kills dopamine and lowers testosterone indirectly
- Reasonable ejaculation frequency is fine—abstinence extremes aren't necessary
- The issue is dopamine dysregulation, not ejaculation itself

**The Problem with Porn:**
- Trains your brain to need novelty for arousal
- Reduces motivation and drive
- Can cause erectile dysfunction
- Creates unrealistic expectations

**The Protocol:**
- Eliminate or drastically reduce porn
- Real sexual activity is fine and healthy
- If you choose to abstain, 7-day cycles show a testosterone spike around day 7

**The Signal:**
A man with controlled impulses and healthy sexual function signals high status to his endocrine system.`,

      title: 'Environmental Detox (Massive ROI)',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Remove xenoestrogens from your environment.**

These are endocrine disruptors that mimic estrogen and suppress testosterone.

**The Swaps:**
- Don't microwave plastic
- Ditch fragrance-heavy body washes, deodorants
- Use glass/stainless steel for water
- Avoid cheap cooking pans with endocrine disruptors
- Reduce exposure to phthalates and BPA (massive endocrine disruptors)

**Where They Hide:**
- Plastic food containers
- Non-stick cookware
- Conventional deodorants
- Air fresheners
- Receipt paper (BPA coating)

**The ROI:**
This costs nothing but removing products. The upside is significant—reduced estrogen load and better testosterone:estrogen ratio.`,

      title: 'Social Frame & Status',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**This is underrated:** testosterone increases when men feel dominant, respected, and socially capable.

**What Raises Testosterone:**
- Winning, progress, achieving goals
- Higher testosterone → higher testosterone (positive feedback loop)
- Stagnation, insecurity, purposelessness → lower testosterone

**The Protocol:**
- Set and achieve goals (any domain)
- Build competence in something
- Take on challenges that stretch you
- Maintain strong social connections
- Avoid chronic isolation

**The Signal:**
Your lifestyle literally signals your endocrine system.

A man who:
- Trains hard
- Gets sunlight
- Avoids toxins
- Has purpose and achievement

...will have measurably higher testosterone than a man who doesn't, regardless of genetics.`,
