      content: `Your hormones control how easily you build muscle, stay lean, recover, and look sharp day-to-day.

When these markers drift off, you feel it instantly—worse pumps, slower recovery, easier fat gain, softer facial features, poor recovery, and poor aesthetics.

**Key Markers to Track:**
- Total Testosterone
- Free Testosterone
- SHBG
- Estradiol
- LH / FSH
- Prolactin
- DHT
- Thyroid (TSH, Free T3, Free T4)

**The Goal:**
Understand what optimal looks like, so you can identify problems before they become obvious symptoms.`,

      title: 'Testosterone Markers',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Total Testosterone**
- Ideal: 650-1200 ng/dL
- Red Flags: <500 ng/dL
- Higher T = better recovery, easier leanness, stronger libido, better mood

**Free Testosterone**
- Ideal: 15-30 pg/dL
- Red Flags: <12 ng/dL
- Free T = what your body can actually use

**Why Both Matter:**
You can have high total T but low free T (bound up by SHBG). This gives you symptoms of low T despite "good" numbers.

**SHBG (Sex Hormone Binding Globulin)**
- Ideal: 20-45 nmol/L
- Too high = low free T (even with good total)
- Too low = T clears too fast, hormonal instability

**Signs of Low Testosterone:**
- Low energy, motivation
- Poor recovery from training
- Fat gain, especially midsection
- Weak erections, low libido
- Brain fog, mood issues`,

      id: 'estrogen',
      title: 'Estrogen & Related Markers',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Estradiol (E2)**
- Ideal: 20-35 pg/mL
- Too low = joint pain, flat mood, low libido
- Too high = water retention, mood swings, gyno risk

**Why E2 Matters:**
This is the most important marker for how "alive" and "full" you feel. Too low is as bad as too high.

**LH / FSH**
- LH Ideal: 3-8 mIU/mL
- FSH Ideal: 3-10 mIU/mL
- Shows natural testicular function and fertility status

**Prolactin**
- Ideal: <12 ng/mL
- High prolactin kills libido, lowers T, worsens mood

**DHT (Dihydrotestosterone)**
- Ideal: 30-80 ng/dL
- High DHT = strong androgenic drive (libido, strength, confidence)
- But also = hair loss risk if genetically prone`,

      id: 'thyroid',
      title: 'Thyroid Markers',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Your thyroid controls metabolic rate.** Low thyroid = slower metabolism, easier fat gain, fatigue, cold hands/feet.

**TSH (Thyroid Stimulating Hormone)**
- Ideal: 1.0-2.0 mIU/L
- Higher = thyroid is struggling (hypothyroid)
- Lower = thyroid overactive (hyperthyroid)

**Free T4**
- Ideal: 1.0-1.5 ng/dL
- The "storage" thyroid hormone

**Free T3**
- Ideal: 3.0-4.0 pg/mL
- The "active" thyroid hormone
- This is what actually speeds up metabolism

**Signs of Low Thyroid:**
- Fatigue despite good sleep
- Cold hands and feet
- Difficulty losing fat
- Brain fog
- Hair loss
- Constipation

**The Connection:**
Low thyroid often mimics low testosterone symptoms. Many guys think they have low T when it's actually thyroid.`,

      title: 'Your Hormone Panel Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Basic Hormone Panel:**
- Total Testosterone
- Free Testosterone
- Estradiol
- SHBG
- TSH

**Comprehensive Panel (Add):**
- LH, FSH
- Prolactin
- Free T3, Free T4
- DHT (if hair loss concern)

**Testing Protocol:**
- Test in the morning (8-10am) when T peaks
- Fast 12 hours
- No heavy training day before
- No alcohol 48 hours before

**When These Markers Drift Off:**
When your physique starts looking "flat" or "watery" despite good diet and training, these markers usually explain why.

**What to Do If Markers Are Off:**
1. Optimize lifestyle first (sleep, stress, nutrition)
2. Retest in 8-12 weeks
3. If still off, consult with an endocrinologist or hormone specialist
4. Don't jump to TRT without trying lifestyle optimization first`,
