      content: `**Best For:**
- Intermediates (6+ months training)
- Those who can train 4 days/week
- People wanting more volume than full body
- Natural lifters seeking optimal frequency

**The Science:**
- Each muscle hit 2x per week
- More volume per session than full body
- Good balance of frequency and recovery
- Flexible scheduling

**The Sweet Spot:**
Upper/Lower is arguably the most efficient split for natural lifters. Hits the sweet spot of frequency, volume, and recovery.`,

      content: `**Strength Days (A Days):**
- Rep range 4-6
- When you hit 3×6, add 5-10lbs
- Stay at lower end longer (form matters more)

**Hypertrophy Days (B Days):**
- Rep range 8-12
- When you hit top of range for all sets, add weight
- Can also add sets instead of weight

**Weekly Progress Target:**
- Add 1 rep to at least one exercise per session
- Or add weight to at least one exercise per week

**Deload Protocol:**
- Every 6-8 weeks
- Use 50-60% of normal weight
- Keep same exercises, just lighter
- Recover and reset`,

- Add 2 sets of flyes to Upper B
- Or replace OHP with another press variation

**If Back is Weak:**
- Add 2 sets of pull-ups or pulldowns
- Prioritize back exercises first in workout

**If Arms are Weak:**
- Add an arm day (optional 5th day)
- Or add 2-3 sets to each upper day

**If Legs are Weak:**
- Add 2 sets of leg press or hack squat
- Prioritize squats early when fresh

**Schedule Flexibility:**
- Can do Mon/Tue/Wed/Fri if needed
- At least 1 rest day between same muscle groups

      content: `**Week 1: Setup**
- Find starting weights for all exercises
- Start at 70-80% of what you think you can do
- Focus on form, not ego

**Weeks 2-6: Execute**
- Follow progression protocol
- Track everything
- Don't miss sessions

**Week 7: Deload**
- 50-60% weight
- Same exercises
- Active recovery

**Weeks 8+: Continue**
- Back to normal weights
- Keep progressing
- Evaluate at week 12

**Time Per Session:**
- Upper: 60-75 minutes
- Lower: 50-60 minutes

**The Payoff:**
4 days per week, hitting everything twice. More volume than full body, more recovery than PPL. For most naturals, this is the sweet spot.`,
