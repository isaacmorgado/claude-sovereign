      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Your drive, action & appearance all hinge on how cleanly your brain regulates dopamine.

Most guys think they lack motivation, when in reality they burnt their dopamine on cheap stimulation—fix your reward system, and you become someone who actually wants to execute.

**What Dopamine Does:**
- Controls motivation and drive
- Determines what you find rewarding
- Affects follow-through on goals
- Influences mood and energy

**The Problem:**
Your brain just wants reward—you decide what it attaches to.

If you feed it:
- Scrolling, porn & constant novelty: you wire it to chase distraction
- Training, business & delayed reward: you wire it to chase achievement

**This is why some guys can't sit still and work while others seem effortlessly disciplined.**`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Your brain just wants reward—you decide what it attaches to.

**Cheap Dopamine Sources:**
- Scrolling social media
- Porn
- Video games
- Constant snacking
- Novelty-seeking

**Expensive Dopamine Sources:**
- Training
- Building skills
- Creating things
- Achieving goals
- Delayed gratification

**The Swap:**
Swap them for the ones you want it to chase.

If you feed it:
- Scrolling, porn & constant novelty: you wire it to chase distraction
- Training, business & delayed reward: you wire it to chase achievement

**The Result:**
You become someone who naturally wants to do hard things because your brain has learned that's where the reward comes from.`,

      content: `**How you spend your first few waking hours dictates your entire day.**

If you feed it:
- No phone for 30-60 minutes after waking
- Sunlight within 10 minutes (or light therapy)
- Delay caffeine 60-120 minutes

**Cheap dopamine hits in the morning:**
- Scrolling immediately
- Stimulating content before work
- Coffee the second you wake up

**This alone shifts your brain from seeking stimulation to seeking pursuit.**

**Earned Dopamine Beats Cheap Dopamine**
Cheap dopamine feels good but destroys drive.
Earned dopamine builds momentum.

**Train it through:**
- Task before pleasure
- Finishing projects before scrolling
- Boredom tolerance (5-minute scrolling daily)

**This is how you rewire the brain so it actually wants to work.**`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Focus isn't something you feel—it's something you structure.

**A. Either With:**
- One task at a time
- 45/15 | 90/15 break structure
- Same time daily

**Make productivity the path of least resistance—that's real discipline.**

**B. The Work Ritual:**
- Same workspace
- Same pre-work routine
- Notifications OFF
- Phone in another room

**The Goal:**
Create a system where focus is the default, not something you have to summon through willpower.

When your environment and habits are structured for focus, discipline becomes automatic.`,

      title: 'Your Dopamine Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Daily Non-Negotiables:**
- No phone first 30-60 minutes
- Morning light exposure
- Delayed caffeine (90+ minutes)
- One deep work block before any entertainment

**Weekly Practices:**
- 1-2 days with minimal/no social media
- Boredom tolerance training (sit with nothing for 10 min)
- Review: Did I earn my dopamine or steal it?

**The Compounding Effect:**
Week 1: Feels hard, you want distraction
Week 2-3: Slightly easier, noticing more drive
Week 4+: Your brain starts seeking productive work naturally

**The Goal:**
You don't enhance chaos—you enhance execution.

If your dopamine system is trash, making you impulsive. If your environment is clean, they make you lethal.

**Your Environment is Key:**
When you change the room, your brain changes with it. Structure your environment so focus is the default output, not something you fight yourself to do.`,
