      title: 'Does Carb Timing Matter?',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**The Short Answer:** A little. Not as much as total intake.

**The Hierarchy:**
1. Total daily calories (most important)
2. Total protein intake
3. Total carb intake
4. Carb timing (least important, still helps)

**When Timing Matters Most:**
- Training hard 4-6x per week
- Trying to maximize performance
- Fine-tuning already-solid nutrition

**When Timing Doesn't Matter:**
- You're not hitting basics consistently
- Training is casual/infrequent
- You're just starting out

**The Reality:**
If your total calories and macros are off, carb timing won't save you. If they're dialed in, timing can give you an extra 5-10% edge.`,

      title: 'Carbs Around Training',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Pre-Workout (1-3 Hours Before)**
- 30-60g carbs
- Complex sources: rice, oats, potatoes
- Provides fuel for session
- Prevents low blood sugar during training

**Intra-Workout (During)**
- Only needed for sessions >90 minutes
- Simple carbs: sports drink, fruit
- Most people don't need this

**Post-Workout (Within 2 Hours)**
- 30-80g carbs (based on training volume)
- Replenishes glycogen
- Supports recovery
- Can be simple or complex

**The Window:**
The "anabolic window" is overhyped but not fake. You have 2-4 hours post-workout where nutrient uptake is enhanced. Don't stress about eating immediately, but don't wait 8 hours either.`,

      title: 'Daily Carb Distribution',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Option 1: Even Distribution**
- Split carbs evenly across meals
- Simple, easy to track
- Works for most people

**Option 2: Training-Focused**
- Most carbs around training
- Lower carbs other meals
- Better for performance

**Option 3: Carb Backloading**
- Low carbs during day
- High carbs at night
- Can improve sleep
- Works for some people

**Sample Training Day (200g Carbs):**
- Breakfast: 30g (eggs + oats)
- Lunch: 40g (rice + chicken)
- Pre-Workout: 50g (rice + protein)
- Post-Workout: 60g (rice + protein shake)
- Dinner: 20g (vegetables + meat)

**Sample Rest Day (150g Carbs):**
- Spread more evenly
- No need for peri-workout loading`,

      title: 'Carb Sources Matter',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**For Performance (Around Training):**
- White rice (fast digesting)
- Potatoes
- Fruit
- Rice cakes
- Sports drinks (intra only)

**For Sustained Energy (Other Meals):**
- Oats
- Brown rice
- Sweet potatoes
- Whole grains
- Legumes

**Limit:**
- Added sugars (except around training)
- Processed carbs
- Sugary drinks

**The Simple Rule:**
- Training time: Simple, fast-digesting carbs are fine
- Other times: Prefer complex, fiber-rich carbs

**Fiber Note:**
25-40g fiber daily from vegetables, fruits, and whole grains. Supports gut health, satiety, and digestion.`,

      title: 'Your Carb Timing Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Step 1: Get Total Carbs Right**
Based on your calorie needs and goals (see nutrition basics guide).

**Step 2: Prioritize Around Training**
- 40-50% of daily carbs around workout window
- Pre + post workout combined

**Step 3: Fill in the Rest**
- Remaining carbs spread through other meals
- Lower carbs at meals far from training

**Example Setup (150g Carbs, Training at 5pm):**
- 7am Breakfast: 20g
- 12pm Lunch: 30g
- 3pm Pre-Workout Snack: 40g
- 7pm Post-Workout Dinner: 50g
- 9pm Snack: 10g

**Rest Day Adjustment:**
- Drop total carbs slightly (optional)
- Distribute more evenly
- No peri-workout priority needed

**The Key:**
Don't overcomplicate this. Hit your total carbs, put more around training, and you're 90% there.`,
