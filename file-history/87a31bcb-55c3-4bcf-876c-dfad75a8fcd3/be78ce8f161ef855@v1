      content: `You don't grow in the gym—you grow while recovering. Training is the stimulus. Recovery is where the adaptation happens.

Most guys overtrain and under-recover. They look flat, hold water, feel tired, and wonder why they're not making progress.

**What Proper Recovery Gets You:**
- Faster muscle repair and growth
- Lower baseline cortisol
- Better sleep quality
- Sharper facial definition (less puffiness)
- More consistent energy

**The Problem:**
Recovery isn't sexy. Nobody posts their sleep on Instagram. But it's where 80% of your results actually come from.`,

      content: `These aren't just "nice to have"—they directly improve sleep onset, depth, and recovery output.

**1. Sauna (4x Sleep Hormone Production)**
- 15-20 min, 170-200°F
- 2-4x per week
- Increases growth hormone and melatonin production
- Best done 2-3 hours before bed

**2. Cold Exposure (20-60 seconds)**
- A fast nervous-system reset
- Cuts stress loops and makes you calmer
- Cold showers work—you don't need ice baths
- Do it earlier in day, not right before bed

**3. Walking (10-15 min)**
- Lowers cortisol
- Improves digestion
- Sharpens mental clarity
- Reduces inflammation
- Not for fat loss—for nervous system regulation

**4. Massage Gun / Soft Tissue Work**
- 5-10 min on tight areas
- Reduces muscle tension that disrupts sleep
- Focus on traps, neck, hip flexors`,

      content: `**1. Smart Caffeine Timing**
- Delay caffeine 90 minutes after waking
- If bedtime = 11:00pm, cutoff caffeine at 3:00pm
- Swap late coffees for decaf/herbal tea or decaf

Caffeine early in the day spikes cortisol instantly. Most guys don't feel it, but their face shows it.

**2. 10-15 Minutes of Light Daily Movement**
Walking or light mobility:
- Lowers cortisol
- Improves digestion
- Sharpens mental clarity
- Reduces inflammation

Not for fat loss—for nervous system regulation.

**3. Breathwork to Kill Stress Instantly**
Protocol:
- 4-second inhale, 6-8 second exhale
- 2-5 minutes

Breathing impacts your nervous system more than any supplement.

**4. Night-Time Stimulus Shutdown**
Night rule: 1 hour before bed = no high-stimulus screens

This alone shifts your brain from seeking stimulation to seeking rest.`,

      title: 'Lifestyle Recovery Rules',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**1. Hydration**
- 3-4L water daily
- Front-load earlier in day (less before bed)
- Add electrolytes if training hard

**2. Caffeine Protocol**
- No caffeine within 8 hours of bed
- Earlier is better
- If you need coffee to function, you're under-recovered

**3. Alcohol Rule**
- Alcohol destroys REM sleep
- Even "moderate" drinking measurably reduces recovery
- If you drink, stop 3+ hours before bed minimum
- Ideally: zero alcohol when optimizing

**4. Sleep Schedule Consistency**
- Same wake time every day (including weekends)
- Same wind-down routine
- Predictable = recoverable

These rules are boring. They also work.`,

      content: `**Daily (Non-Negotiable):**
- Morning light exposure (10-20 min)
- 10-15 min walking
- Wind-down routine 1 hour before bed
- No caffeine after 2pm

**2-4x Per Week:**
- Sauna (15-20 min) OR
- Cold exposure (1-3 min)
- Soft tissue work / stretching

**Weekly:**
- 1 full rest day (no training)
- Track sleep quality (Oura, Whoop, or just subjective 1-10)

**Monthly:**
- Assess: Are you recovering? Energy stable? Face tight?
- If not, add recovery before adding training volume

**The Mindset Shift:**
Stop thinking "I need to train harder."
Start thinking "I need to recover better."

The guy who sleeps 8 hours and trains 4x/week will out-progress the guy who sleeps 6 hours and trains 6x/week.`,
