      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Everybody wants to "lock in"—but their brain is literally underpowered.

Foggy thinking, low drive, indecision—most of it isn't psychological. **It's electrical starvation.**

**Your brain runs on:**
- Sodium/potassium balance
- Dopamine precursors
- Omega-3 mediated signaling
- Sleep-driven glymphatic clearance

**The Problem:**
Most guys are deficient in one or more of these. They try to "focus harder" when their brain literally doesn't have the fuel to focus.

**It isn't that you need more focus—your brain just hasn't been physically powered to think.**`,

      title: 'Salt + Electrolytes First Thing',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Fixes brain fog and restores electrical firing.**

Your brain runs on electrical signals. Those signals require proper sodium/potassium balance.

**Protocol:**
- Himalayan salt + water OR LMNT first thing
- Before coffee, before food

**What It Does:**
- Clears morning brain fog
- Improves focus and alertness
- Supports hydration
- Enables proper neurotransmitter function

**Signs You Need This:**
- Morning brain fog that coffee doesn't fix
- Low energy despite sleep
- Lightheadedness when standing
- Afternoon crashes

**The Simple Fix:**
1/4 tsp salt in water first thing. Costs nothing, works immediately.`,

      title: 'Protein as the First Meal',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Stabilizes neurotransmitters which results in a calmer mind and cleaner execution.**

**The Problem with Carb-First Meals:**
- Blood sugar spike → crash
- Dopamine spike → crash
- Foggy, sluggish mid-morning

**The Protein-First Protocol:**
- 30-40g protein as first meal
- Eggs, meat, protein shake
- Minimal carbs until later in day (if cutting)

**What It Does:**
- Provides amino acids for neurotransmitter production
- Stabilizes blood sugar
- Sustained energy without crashes
- Better focus and mood

**Your brain loves it more than your muscles do.**`,

      title: 'Creatine (3-5g/day)',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Yes, it improves memory, working speed, and decision-making.**

Most people think creatine is just for muscles. It's not.

**The Science:**
- Your brain uses creatine for ATP (energy)
- Creatine crosses the blood-brain barrier
- Improves cognitive performance, especially under stress
- Benefits memory, processing speed, and decision-making

**Protocol:**
- 3-5g daily
- Timing doesn't matter
- Take consistently (effects build over time)

**Who Benefits Most:**
- People under stress or sleep-deprived
- Vegetarians (lower baseline creatine)
- Anyone doing mentally demanding work

**The ROI:**
Creatine costs ~$0.10/day and has decades of safety data. One of the highest-ROI supplements for both body and brain.`,

      content: `**Magnesium Glycinate at Night**
- Better sleep = cleaner dopamine cycling the next day
- 200-400mg before bed
- Supports 300+ enzymatic reactions including neurotransmitter synthesis

**Omega-3 (EPA Priority)**
- Reduces inflammation that slows signaling
- Your thinking literally sharpens
- 2-3g fish oil daily (high EPA)
- DHA for structure, EPA for inflammation

**Choline Sources**
- Eggs, liver, or supplemental Alpha-GPC
- Precursor to acetylcholine (memory, focus)
- Most people are deficient

**B Vitamins**
- Energy metabolism in brain cells
- Get from red meat or supplement B-complex`,

      content: `**Morning:**
- Salt + water (before anything else)
- High-protein first meal
- Delay caffeine 90 minutes (or pair with L-Theanine)

**Daily:**
- Creatine 3-5g
- Omega-3 2-3g (high EPA)
- Choline from eggs or supplement

**Evening:**
- Magnesium glycinate 200-400mg

**Total Monthly Cost:** ~$30-40

**The Hierarchy:**
1. Sleep (brain's recovery window)
2. Electrolytes (electrical function)
3. Protein (neurotransmitter building blocks)
4. Creatine + Omega-3 (performance + anti-inflammation)

**The Point:**
You can't think your way to better focus if your brain is physically underpowered.

Feed it properly, and clarity becomes the default state—not something you have to fight for.`,
