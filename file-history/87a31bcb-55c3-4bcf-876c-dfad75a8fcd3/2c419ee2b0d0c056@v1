      title: '1. Sauna (Heat Exposure)',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Protocol:** 15-20 minutes at 170-200°F, 2-4x per week

**Benefits:**
- 4x growth hormone increase
- Improved cardiovascular function
- Enhanced sleep quality (melatonin boost)
- Reduced inflammation
- Improved insulin sensitivity

**Best Timing:**
- 2-3 hours before bed (for sleep benefits)
- OR post-workout (for recovery)
- NOT right before bed (core temp too elevated)

**How It Works:**
Heat stress triggers heat shock proteins that repair damaged cells and boost recovery. It also mimics the cardiovascular effects of moderate exercise.

**Practical Tips:**
- Dry sauna > steam room for these benefits
- Start with 10 min and build up
- Stay hydrated (drink water before and after)
- Don't use post-workout if prioritizing hypertrophy (may blunt muscle protein synthesis)`,

      id: 'cold-exposure',
      title: '2. Cold Exposure',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Protocol:** 20-60 seconds of cold shower, or 1-3 min cold plunge

**Benefits:**
- Fast nervous-system reset
- Cuts stress loops
- Makes you calmer and harder to rattle
- Increases norepinephrine (focus and alertness)
- May improve brown fat activation

**Best Timing:**
- Morning (for alertness)
- After high-stress periods
- NOT right before bed (too stimulating)
- NOT immediately post-workout if hypertrophy is the goal

**The Truth:**
You don't need ice baths. Cold showers work. The benefit comes from the cold stress response, not the specific temperature.

**Practical Tips:**
- End your shower with 20-60 seconds of coldest setting
- Focus on breathing slowly through it
- The stress inoculation is the point—it builds resilience`,

      id: 'walking',
      title: '3. Low-Intensity Walking',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Protocol:** 10-15 minutes, light daily movement

**Benefits:**
- Lowers cortisol
- Improves digestion
- Sharpens mental clarity
- Reduces inflammation
- Promotes lymphatic drainage (reduces puffiness)

**Best Timing:**
- Post-meal (improves glucose response)
- Morning (locks in circadian rhythm)
- Evening (wind-down before bed)

**Why It Works:**
Walking activates the parasympathetic nervous system. It's not exercise—it's nervous system regulation.

**The Mistake:**
Most guys think walking is "too easy" to matter. But it's one of the highest-ROI recovery tools because it's sustainable, free, and effective.

**Practical Tips:**
- No headphones occasionally (reduces stimulation)
- Outside > treadmill (natural light + fresh air)
- Don't turn it into cardio—keep it easy`,

      id: 'massage',
      title: '4. Soft Tissue Work & Massage',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Protocol:** 5-10 minutes daily on tight areas

**Benefits:**
- Reduces muscle tension
- Improves blood flow
- Decreases cortisol
- Better sleep when done before bed
- Faster recovery between sessions

**Tools:**
- Massage gun (Theragun, Hypervolt, cheap Amazon versions work)
- Foam roller
- Lacrosse ball (for specific trigger points)

**Key Areas:**
- Traps and neck (holds stress)
- Hip flexors (tight from sitting)
- Glutes and piriformis
- Upper back/thoracic spine

**Timing:**
- Evening: Focus on relaxation (lighter pressure, slower movements)
- Pre-workout: Focus on activation (faster, moderate pressure)

**Practical Tips:**
- 30-60 seconds per area is enough
- Don't go too hard—moderate pressure works
- Consistency > intensity`,

      title: 'Modality Rankings by ROI',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Tier 1: Non-Negotiable (Free, Massive Impact)**
1. Sleep optimization
2. Walking (10-15 min daily)
3. Breathwork (2-5 min)
4. Hydration

**Tier 2: High ROI (Low Cost, High Benefit)**
1. Cold shower (free)
2. Soft tissue work (one-time equipment cost)
3. Sunlight exposure (free)

**Tier 3: Worth It If Accessible**
1. Sauna (gym membership or home unit)
2. Professional massage (1-2x/month)
3. Float tank (occasional)

**Tier 4: Diminishing Returns**
1. Cryotherapy chambers
2. Red light therapy beds
3. Hyperbaric oxygen

**The Point:**
Don't skip Tier 1-2 while chasing Tier 4. The basics done consistently beat fancy modalities done occasionally.

Most guys need more sleep and walking, not more biohacks.`,
