      content: `Most guys think sleep hygiene is candles and lavender sprays. In reality, it's about eliminating the physiological friction that ruins sleep quality without you even noticing.

**The Real Sleep Drivers:**
1. Light discipline (your brain's chemical signals)
2. Nervous system state (sympathetic vs parasympathetic)
3. Core body temperature
4. Sleep pressure (adenosine buildup)

Get these right, and sleep becomes effortless. Ignore them, and no amount of melatonin will save you.`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Your eyes dictate your brain's chemical signals. If you flood your retina with blue/white light at night, melatonin drops and your entire system refuses to switch into sleep mode.

What you want is warm, low-intensity lighting and zero bright screens 1 hour before bed.

**The Goal:** Make your environment look like sunset.

**Core Rules:**
- Disable bright overhead lights after sunset
- Switch screens to warm-tone mode
- Avoid LED white light in the last hour before bed
- Use lamps, not ceiling lights

You're basically signaling to your brain: "we're done for the day."

**Blue Light = Daytime Signal**
Even a few minutes of bright screen exposure can delay melatonin release by 30-60 minutes.`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `You cannot go from scrolling TikTok to "deep sleep." Your nervous system has gears. Most guys try to sleep while still in fight-or-flight mode.

A proper wind-down routine shifts you from **sympathetic (stress)** to **parasympathetic (recovery)**.

**High-ROI Protocol:**
- Drop stimulants after 2pm
- Stop work / mental stimulation 1 hour before bed
- Slow breathing (4-6 seconds exhale focus)
- Light stretching to release tension
- Switch into silence: no blue-light, no notifications

**The Entire Goal:** Reduce cortisol, increase melatonin, and calm the mind.

If you go to bed wired, you'll either not fall asleep or your sleep quality will be trash even if you're unconscious for 8 hours.`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `These are the things most guys don't realize are destroying their sleep:

**Doomscrolling Before Bed**
Keeps your brain in reactive mode. Content consumption = dopamine hits = alertness.

**Heavy Meals 1-2 Hours Before Sleeping**
Induces bloating, heartburn, and keeps your digestive system active when it should be resting.

**Alcohol**
Destroys REM sleep and testosterone. One drink can measurably reduce sleep quality.

**Porn**
Triggers dopamine and overstimulates before rest.

**Late-Night Cardio or Heavy Lifts**
Raises cortisol when you need it dropping.

**The Rule:**
Sleep is hormonal. If you trash your hormones before bed, no amount of "8 hours" will save you.`,

      title: '4. Core Temperature Management',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Your core temperature must drop to initiate and maintain deep sleep.

**The Science:**
- Body temp naturally drops 1-2°F during sleep
- If your bedroom is too hot, you can't initiate this drop
- This is why hot rooms cause fragmented sleep

**Optimal Setup:**
- Bedroom temperature: 65-68°F (18-20°C)
- Use breathable sheets (cotton, bamboo)
- Consider sleeping naked or with minimal clothing
- A warm shower 1-2 hours before bed actually helps (causes rebound cooling)

**Cold Room + Warm Blankets** = The ideal setup

This single variable fixes insomnia for 70%+ of people.`,

      content: `**Tonight:**
- Switch to warm lighting after sunset
- No screens in the last hour (or heavy warm filter)
- Drop bedroom temp to 65-68°F

**This Week:**
- No caffeine after 2pm
- No alcohol within 3 hours of bed
- Add 5-min breathing/stretching before bed

**Ongoing:**
- Protect your wind-down window religiously
- Track what disrupts your sleep and eliminate it
- Prioritize sleep over late-night productivity

**The Result:**
Dial in these drivers and you'll fall asleep faster, stay asleep longer, and wake up actually feeling recovered—without any supplements.`,
