      content: `Most "stress supplements" are useless. These are the few that actually lower cortisol, improve sleep, and keep you calmer under load.

**The Reality:**
- 90% of supplements are marketing
- These are the 10% with actual evidence
- They work best on top of good habits (not as replacements)

**What They Do:**
- Lower baseline cortisol
- Improve sleep quality
- Reduce anxiety without sedation
- Support recovery

**What They Don't Do:**
- Fix a garbage lifestyle
- Replace sleep
- Work miracles overnight`,

      title: 'Ashwagandha (KSM-66 / Sensoril)',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**The most reliable cortisol-lowering supplement.**

**Benefits:**
- Lowers cortisol 20-30%
- Better sleep, less stress blunting, calmer mood
- May support testosterone in stressed individuals

**Dose:** 300-600mg daily

**Forms:**
- KSM-66: More stimulating, better for daytime
- Sensoril: More calming, better for evening

**Timing:**
- Morning or evening (experiment)
- With food

**Notes:**
- Effects build over 2-4 weeks
- Cycle off occasionally (8 weeks on, 2 weeks off)
- Some people don't respond—that's normal`,

      id: 'l-theanine',
      title: 'L-Theanine',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Smooths caffeine and stabilizes focus.**

**Benefits:**
- Reduces stress spikes
- Eliminates caffeine jitters
- Promotes calm alertness (not sedation)

**Dose:** 100-200mg with caffeine

**Best Use:**
- Take with your morning coffee
- Smooths the caffeine curve
- No crash, no jitters, better focus

**Why It Works:**
L-Theanine increases alpha brain waves (calm focus) and GABA (relaxation) without causing drowsiness.

**Notes:**
- Works immediately
- Can also take before bed for relaxation
- Very safe, no cycling needed`,

      id: 'magnesium',
      title: 'Magnesium Glycinate / Threonate',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Your nighttime nervous-system reset.**

**Benefits:**
- Lowers evening cortisol
- Helps you fall asleep faster
- Improves sleep quality
- Supports 300+ enzymatic reactions

**Dose:** 300-400mg before bed

**Forms:**
- **Glycinate:** Best for sleep and relaxation
- **Threonate:** Crosses blood-brain barrier, best for cognition
- **Citrate:** Good absorption, can cause loose stools
- **Oxide:** Cheap, poor absorption (avoid)

**Why Most People Need It:**
Most diets are magnesium-deficient. Training and sweating deplete it further.

**Notes:**
- Take 30-60 min before bed
- Start with 200mg and increase if needed
- Glycinate is the best all-around form`,

      title: 'Other Worth Mentioning',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Rhodiola Rosea**
- Keeps you sharp under pressure
- Reduces mental fatigue
- Balances cortisol during heavy workload
- Dose: 200-400mg in the morning

**Glycine**
- Underrated sleep enhancer
- Lowers core temp (helps sleep onset)
- Reduces nighttime cortisol
- Dose: 3-5g before bed

**Omega-3 (EPA/DHA)**
- Indirect cortisol control via inflammation reduction
- Better mood, less water retention
- Dose: 1-2g EPA/DHA daily

      title: 'The Practical Stack',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Tier 1: Start Here**
- Magnesium Glycinate: 300-400mg before bed
- L-Theanine: 100-200mg with morning coffee

**Tier 2: Add If Needed**
- Ashwagandha: 300-600mg daily (if high stress)
- Omega-3: 1-2g EPA/DHA daily

**Tier 3: Situational**

**The Rule:**
Supplements should enhance good habits, not replace them.

A guy sleeping 8 hours with no supplements will outperform a guy sleeping 5 hours with every supplement on this list.

Fix the basics first. Then optimize with supplements.`,
