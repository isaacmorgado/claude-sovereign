      content: `**Best For:**
- Beginners (first 6-12 months)
- Busy people (only 3 days available)
- Those returning after a break
- Natural lifters who want efficiency

**The Science:**
- Each muscle hit 3x per week
- More frequent protein synthesis spikes
- Compounds hit everything efficiently
- Less total gym time needed

**The Trade-off:**
- Less volume per muscle per session
- Can't focus heavily on weak points
- Harder to recover from as you advance

**The Sweet Spot:**
If you can only train 3 days per week, full body is optimal.`,

      title: 'Progression Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**How to Progress:**

1. Start with a weight you can do for the LOW end of the rep range
2. Each session, try to add 1 rep
3. When you hit the HIGH end of the rep range for all sets, add weight

**Example:**
- Week 1: Bench 135lbs × 6,6,6
- Week 2: Bench 135lbs × 7,6,6
- Week 3: Bench 135lbs × 8,7,7
- Week 4: Bench 135lbs × 8,8,8
- Week 5: Bench 140lbs × 6,6,6 (add weight, restart)

**Weight Jumps:**
- Upper body: 5lb increments
- Lower body: 10lb increments
- Can use microplates (2.5lb) for slower progress

**When Progress Stalls:**
- Check recovery (sleep, food)
- Deload for a week (50% weight)
- Consider moving to Upper/Lower split`,

      title: 'Execution Tips',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Warm-Up:**
- 5 min cardio
- Empty bar × 10 for main lifts
- 50% × 5, 70% × 3, then work sets

**Rest Periods:**
- Compounds: 2-3 minutes
- Accessories: 60-90 seconds

**Form Priority:**
- Squat: Depth to parallel or below, knees tracking toes
- Deadlift: Neutral spine, hinge at hips
- Bench: Arch back, retract scapula, feet planted
- Row: No swinging, squeeze at top

**Common Mistakes:**
- Going too heavy too soon
- Not tracking workouts
- Skipping leg exercises
- Not eating enough to recover

**Time Per Session:** 45-60 minutes`,

      title: 'Getting Started',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Week 1: Find Your Starting Weights**
- Start conservative (you can always add)
- Should be challenging but not failing
- Leave 2-3 reps in reserve

**Weeks 2-8: Execute and Progress**
- Follow the progression protocol
- Track every workout
- Don't skip sessions

**Week 9+: Evaluate**
- Still making progress? Continue
- Stalling? Deload then continue
- Want more volume? Move to Upper/Lower

**Nutrition:**
- Protein: 1g per pound bodyweight
- Surplus for muscle gain, deficit for fat loss
- Sleep 7-9 hours

**The Payoff:**
3 days a week, 45-60 minutes per session. That's 3 hours per week for significant muscle growth.

Most people overthink this. Just do the program, eat enough protein, sleep enough, and progress will come.`,
