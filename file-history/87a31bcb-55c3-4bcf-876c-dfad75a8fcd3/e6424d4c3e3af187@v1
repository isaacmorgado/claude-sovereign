      title: 'Why Organ Health Matters for Aesthetics',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Your organs determine how efficiently you can train, digest food, and recover. When liver or kidney function suffers outside optimal ranges, you instantly feel it—worse pumps, slower recovery, fatigue, water retention, poor digestion, and a softer look.

**Organ health is the hidden lever behind how "clean" or "watery" your physique looks day to day.**

This keeps it simple: check the markers that directly influence how you look and feel.

**Key Markers:**
- Liver Enzymes (ALT, AST)
- Kidney Function (Creatinine, eGFR)
- Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium)
- Hydration Markers (BUN, BUN:Creatinine Ratio)`,

      id: 'liver',
      title: 'Liver Enzymes (ALT, AST)',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Ideal:** ALT <30, AST <30
**Elevated** = poor recovery, inflammation, reduced nutrient partitioning

**What Elevated Liver Enzymes Mean:**
- Your liver is working harder than it should
- Often from: alcohol, supplements, medications, or fatty liver
- Results in: puffier look, slower recovery, fatigue

**How to Improve:**
- Hydrate properly (electrolytes, not just water)
- Prioritize whole foods and reduce processed fats
- Keep alcohol to near-zero (this is huge)
- Avoid unnecessary supplements
- Prioritize sleep (liver recovers during deep sleep)
- Take rest days from training

**The Connection:**
High levels = sluggish liver detox = puffier, less sharp appearance.

Your liver processes everything you consume. If it's overtaxed, recovery and aesthetics suffer.`,

      id: 'kidney',
      title: 'Kidney Function (Creatinine, eGFR)',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Creatinine** varies with muscle mass—focus on eGFR for optimal function.

**eGFR (Estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate)**
- Ideal: >90 (higher is better)
- Low function = water retention, fatigue, impaired recovery

**BUN (Blood Urea Nitrogen)**
- Ideal: 10-16 mg/dL
- Keep stable with mid-range focus

**BUN:Creatinine Ratio**
- High ratio = under-hydration or excessive protein intake
- Low hydration = flat look, poor pumps, high fatigue

**Why It Matters:**
Your kidneys filter waste and regulate fluid balance. When they're stressed:
- Water retention increases
- Electrolyte balance suffers
- You look "watery" or puffy
- Energy and recovery decline

**How to Improve:**
- Stay properly hydrated
- Don't mega-dose protein (1g/lb is plenty)
- Limit NSAIDs (ibuprofen, etc.)
- Moderate caffeine`,

      id: 'electrolytes',
      title: 'Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium)',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**These dictate hydration, fullness, and muscle contractions.**

**Electrolyte Imbalance = flat muscles, poor performance, cramps**

**Sodium**
- Don't fear salt (especially if training hard)
- Low sodium causes water retention paradoxically
- 3-5g daily for active individuals

**Potassium**
- Target: 3,500-4,700mg daily
- From food: bananas, potatoes, avocados
- Critical for muscle function and fluid balance

**Magnesium**
- Most people are deficient
- 200-400mg daily supplement recommended
- Glycinate form best for absorption

**Signs of Electrolyte Imbalance:**
- Muscle cramps
- Fatigue despite sleep
- Flat-looking muscles
- Poor pumps
- Headaches

**The Fix:**
- Add electrolytes to water (especially around training)
- Don't restrict salt unless medically necessary
- Supplement magnesium
- Eat potassium-rich foods`,

      title: 'Your Organ Function Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Test These:**
- Comprehensive Metabolic Panel (CMP)
  - Includes: electrolytes, kidney function, liver enzymes, glucose
- Cost: Usually $20-50 at direct labs

**Optimize These:**
1. Hydration (3-4L water + electrolytes)
2. Sleep quality (liver recovery happens during deep sleep)
3. Alcohol reduction (biggest liver stressor)
4. Whole food diet (reduces liver load)

**Add Taurine for Kidney & Electrolyte Support**
- 1-2g daily
- Supports kidney function and electrolyte balance

**Periodic Blood Donation (If Hematocrit High)**
- Keeps blood viscosity optimal
- Helps liver manage iron stores

**Take Rest Days Seriously**
- Kidneys recover from training stress too
- Overtraining taxes all organs

**The Bottom Line:**
Organ health is the hidden lever. If your liver or kidneys are struggling, no amount of training optimization will make you look your best.

Get the basics right: sleep, hydration, minimal alcohol, and your organs will support everything else you're trying to achieve.`,
