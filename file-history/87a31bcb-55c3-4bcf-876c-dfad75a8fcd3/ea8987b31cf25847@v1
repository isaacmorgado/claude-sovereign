      content: `These habits give you the highest aesthetic return with the least effort.

**What Chronic High Cortisol Does:**
- Water retention (puffy face)
- Muscle catabolism (flat muscles)
- Fat storage (especially visceral and face)
- Poor sleep quality
- Suppressed testosterone
- Worse skin (breakouts, dullness)

**The Truth:**
Most guys walk around with chronically elevated cortisol and don't know it. They blame genetics for their puffy face when it's actually stress hormones.

Lower cortisol = tighter face, better recovery, better aesthetics.`,

      id: 'caffeine',
      title: '1. Smart Caffeine Timing',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Rule:** Delay caffeine 90 minutes after waking. If bedtime = 11:00pm, cutoff caffeine at 3:00pm.

Swap late coffees for decaf/herbal tea or decaf.

**Why It Matters:**
Caffeine early in the day spikes cortisol instantly. Most guys don't feel it, but their face shows it.

**The Protocol:**
- Wait 90 min after waking for first coffee
- This lets natural cortisol awakening response happen
- Hard cutoff 8-10 hours before bed
- No energy drinks (way too much caffeine + other stimulants)

**The Result:**
More stable energy, less afternoon crash, better sleep, lower baseline cortisol.`,

      title: '2. 10-15 Minutes of Light Daily Movement',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `Walking or light mobility:
- Lowers cortisol
- Improves digestion
- Sharpens mental clarity
- Reduces inflammation

**Not for fat loss—for nervous system regulation.**

**The Protocol:**
- 10-15 min walk daily (more is fine)
- Preferably outside
- No headphones occasionally (reduces stimulation)
- Post-meal is ideal timing

**Why It Works:**
Walking activates the parasympathetic nervous system. It's the simplest way to shift from stress mode to recovery mode.

Don't underestimate this because it's "easy."`,

      title: '3. Breathwork to Kill Stress Instantly',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Protocol:** 4-second inhale, 6-8 second exhale. 2-5 minutes.

Breathing impacts your nervous system more than any supplement.

**The Science:**
- Long exhales activate parasympathetic nervous system
- Reduces cortisol within minutes
- Lowers heart rate and blood pressure
- Improves HRV (heart rate variability)

**When to Use:**
- Before bed (sleep onset)
- After stressful events
- Before important meetings/conversations
- Any time you feel wired

**Advanced Protocol (NSDR/Yoga Nidra):**
- 10-20 minute guided sessions
- Deeply restorative
- YouTube: "NSDR" or "Yoga Nidra"

This is the closest thing to a reset button for your nervous system.`,

      title: '4. Night-Time Stimulus Shutdown',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Night rule:** 1 hour before bed = no high-stimulus screens

This alone shifts your brain from seeking stimulation to seeking rest.

**What Counts as High-Stimulus:**
- Social media scrolling
- News
- Video games
- Work emails
- Intense TV shows

**What's Allowed:**
- Reading (physical book ideal)
- Light conversation
- Stretching
- Calm music
- Boring content (if you must screen)

**Why It Matters:**
Every piece of stimulating content triggers dopamine, which keeps cortisol elevated. Your brain can't wind down if you're feeding it novelty until the moment you try to sleep.`,

      title: '5. Eat Without Stress',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**If you're anxious before meals:**
- 3 slow breaths
- Sit tall
- Eat slowly

**Why It Matters:**
- Lower satiety + higher inflammation = worse skin, worse digestion, worse nutrient absorption
- Eating while anxious or distracted keeps cortisol high and digestion low

**The Protocol:**
- No phones during meals
- Sit down (don't stand/walk while eating)
- Chew thoroughly
- Take 3 breaths before first bite

**The Result:**
Better digestion, better nutrient absorption, lower cortisol response to food, less bloating.

This sounds trivial but makes a measurable difference.`,

      title: 'Your Daily Cortisol Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Morning:**
- Delay caffeine 90 minutes
- Morning light exposure
- No checking phone immediately

**Afternoon:**
- Caffeine cutoff by 2-3pm
- 10-15 min walk
- Avoid emotional/stressful content

**Evening:**
- Stimulus shutdown 1 hour before bed
- 5-10 min breathwork or stretching
- Eat dinner without screens

**The Goal:**
Create a downward cortisol curve through the day—high in morning (natural), declining through afternoon, low by evening.

Most guys have the opposite: flat or elevated cortisol all day, then can't sleep.

**The Payoff:**
Lower cortisol, elevate sleep quality, and let your body naturally increase testosterone output. This is your hormonal foundation.`,
