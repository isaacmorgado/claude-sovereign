**The Philosophy:**
You don't need to become a hippie. You just need to remove the obvious endocrine disruptors from daily use.

**The Result:**
- Better skin clarity
- Reduced breakouts
- Less water retention
- Better sleep
- Improved recovery
- Better hormone function

This directly improves skin clarity + reduces breakouts.`,

      title: '1. Water & Storage Swaps',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**This is 95% of the ROI.**

| Toxic | Safe Swap |
|-------|-----------|
| Plastic water bottle | Glass water bottle (no plastic) |
| Plastic shaker | Stainless steel shaker |
| Plastic Tupperware | Glass food containers |
| Plastic in microwave | Glass or ceramic only |

**Why It Matters:**
Plastic leaches xenoestrogens, especially when heated. Every time you drink from a plastic bottle that's been in a hot car or microwave plastic, you're dosing yourself with endocrine disruptors.

**The Fix:**
- Get a glass or stainless water bottle ($15-30)
- Replace plastic food storage gradually
- Never heat plastic, ever

**ROI:** Less bloat, better testosterone, clearer skin.`,

      title: '2. Grooming & Hygiene Swaps',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**This directly improves skin clarity + reduces breakouts.**

| Toxic | Safe Swap |
|-------|-----------|
| Fragrance deodorant | Aluminum-free deodorant |
| Cheap body wash | Fragrance-free formula |
| Scented lotion | Smoother skincare formulas (no synthetic fragrance) |
| Body spray | Nothing (or essential oil-based) |

**The Problem:**
"Fragrance" on a label means a proprietary blend of potentially dozens of chemicals. Many are endocrine disruptors.

**Avoid:**
- Cheap body washes that strip your skin microbiome
- Synthetic fragrances (especially body sprays)
- Products with long ingredient lists of unpronounceable chemicals

**The Fix:**
- Switch to fragrance-free versions of what you already use
- Check ingredient lists—fewer = better
- Prioritize products labeled "unscented" or "fragrance-free"`,

      title: '3. Cooking & Food Prep Swaps',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**This alone reduces internal inflammation.**

| Toxic | Safe Swap |
|-------|-----------|
| Non-stick (Teflon) | Stainless steel pan |
| Aluminum cookware | Cast iron skillet |
| Plastic spatulas | Wooden spatula (avoid melting plastic spatulas) |
| Scratched pans | Replace immediately |

**The Problem:**
- Scratched Teflon releases microplastics into food
- Overheated non-stick releases toxic fumes
- Cheap cookware can leach metals

**The Fix:**
- Stainless steel for most cooking
- Cast iron for high-heat (and it adds iron to food)
- Stop using any scratched non-stick pans
- Wooden or silicone utensils

**Priority:** If you have scratched non-stick pans, throw them out today.`,

      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Better air = better sleep = better recovery = better aesthetics.**

| Toxic | Safe Swap |
|-------|-----------|
| Scented candles | Beeswax candles or nothing |
| Air fresheners | Open windows |
| No air filtration | Small air purifier |
| Synthetic bedding | Cotton or bamboo sheets |

**The Fix:**
- Small air purifier in bedroom ($50-100)
- Clean sheets once a week
- Open windows for airflow
- Don't sleep in a room with mold or dampness
- Optional: Himalayan salt lamp for night lighting

**The Sleep Connection:**
Poor air quality directly affects sleep quality. Better air = deeper sleep = better recovery = tighter face.

**Signs Your Air Is Bad:**
- Wake up congested
- Stuffy nose at home but not elsewhere
- Dust buildup despite cleaning
- Musty smell`,
