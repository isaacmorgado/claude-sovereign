      title: '1. Hydration Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Target:** 3-4L water daily (more if training hard or hot climate)

**Why It Matters:**
- Dehydration = higher cortisol
- Even 2% dehydration impairs cognitive and physical performance
- Proper hydration improves nutrient delivery and waste removal
- Better hydration = less water retention (counterintuitive but true)

**Protocol:**
- Start day with 500ml water (before coffee)
- Front-load hydration earlier in day
- Reduce intake 2 hours before bed (to avoid waking to pee)
- Add electrolytes if training hard or sweating a lot

**Signs You're Dehydrated:**
- Dark urine
- Headaches
- Fatigue
- Dry mouth/skin
- Poor workout performance

Chronic mild dehydration is extremely common and makes you look and feel worse.`,

      id: 'caffeine',
      title: '2. Caffeine Management',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Rule:** No caffeine within 8-10 hours of bedtime

**Why It Matters:**
Caffeine has a half-life of 5-6 hours. If you drink coffee at 4pm and sleep at 11pm, you still have 50% of that caffeine in your system.

**Optimal Protocol:**
- Delay first coffee 90 minutes after waking (lets natural cortisol awakening happen)
- Hard cutoff: 2pm (if sleeping at 10-11pm)
- If you "need" coffee to function, you're under-recovered

**Caffeine Replacement After Cutoff:**
- Decaf coffee (still has some, but minimal)
- Herbal tea
- Sparkling water

**The Truth:**
If you're dependent on caffeine, it's masking a recovery problem. Address the root cause (sleep, stress, nutrition) rather than medicating with stimulants.`,

      title: '3. Alcohol Rules',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Baseline Rule:** Alcohol destroys REM sleep and testosterone

Even "moderate" drinking measurably reduces:
- Sleep quality (especially REM)
- Testosterone production
- Growth hormone release
- Next-day recovery
- Fat oxidation

**If You're Going to Drink:**
- Stop 3+ hours before bed minimum
- Hydrate aggressively (1 glass water per drink)
- Accept that recovery will be impaired
- Don't drink on training days

**Optimal Protocol:**
Zero alcohol when optimizing. This isn't moralizing—it's just the biochemistry.

**The Face Test:**
Compare your face the morning after drinking vs. after a clean night. The puffiness, dark circles, and dullness tell you everything you need to know.

Alcohol is the fastest way to undo a week of good habits.`,

      id: 'schedule',
      title: '4. Schedule Consistency',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Rule:** Same wake time every day, including weekends

**Why It Matters:**
Your circadian rhythm runs on consistency. Every time you sleep in on weekends, you're giving yourself jet lag.

**The Protocol:**
- Pick a wake time and stick to it ±30 minutes
- Same wind-down routine every night
- Same pre-sleep environment

**What Consistency Gets You:**
- Faster sleep onset
- Deeper sleep stages
- More predictable energy
- Better hormone timing

**The Hard Truth:**
If you wake at 7am weekdays and 11am weekends, you're resetting your circadian rhythm every Monday. This is why Mondays feel terrible.

Boring schedules = optimized biology.`,

      title: 'Your Lifestyle Recovery Checklist',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Daily Non-Negotiables:**
- [ ] 3-4L water (front-loaded)
- [ ] Caffeine cutoff by 2pm
- [ ] Consistent wake time
- [ ] Wind-down routine

**Weekly Rules:**
- [ ] Minimize/eliminate alcohol
- [ ] 1 full rest day from training
- [ ] Track sleep quality (even subjectively)

**Monthly Check-In:**
- Am I recovering? Energy stable?
- Is my face tight or puffy?
- Do I need coffee to function?
- How's my training performance?

**The Compounding Effect:**
None of these are dramatic. All of them compound.

A guy who:
- Sleeps 8 hours consistently
- Cuts caffeine by 2pm
- Doesn't drink
- Stays hydrated

...will outperform and outlook a guy with "better genetics" who ignores this stuff.

Recovery is the multiplier on everything else you do.`,
