      content: `Fat loss is simple but not easy. Here's how to do it without destroying your hormones, muscle, or sanity.

**The Formula:**
Caloric deficit + high protein + resistance training = fat loss with muscle retention

**The Numbers:**
- Deficit: 300-500 calories below maintenance
- Protein: 1g per pound bodyweight (non-negotiable)
- Rate: 0.5-1% of bodyweight per week

**Why Moderate Deficits Win:**
- Aggressive cuts = more muscle loss
- Aggressive cuts = worse hormone response
- Aggressive cuts = harder to sustain
- Moderate cuts compound over weeks into significant fat loss`,

      title: 'Setting Up Your Cut',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Step 1: Find Maintenance**
Track food for 1 week at stable weight. That's your maintenance.

**Step 2: Create Deficit**
Subtract 300-500 calories from maintenance.

**Step 3: Set Macros**
- Protein: 1g/lb (protect muscle)
- Fat: 0.3g/lb minimum (hormones)
- Carbs: remaining calories

**Step 4: Track Progress**
- Weigh daily, average weekly
- Take progress photos bi-weekly
- Measurements monthly

**Target Rate:**
- 0.5-1lb per week
- Faster = likely losing muscle
- Slower = might need to reduce calories more`,

      title: 'Volume Eating & Hunger Management',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**The Secret to Sustainable Cutting: Volume Eating**

Eat foods that fill you up without many calories.

**High Volume, Low Calorie Foods:**
- Vegetables (unlimited basically)
- Egg whites
- Lean proteins (chicken breast, white fish)
- Fruits (especially berries)
- Popcorn (air-popped)
- Clear soups

**Satiety Hacks:**
- Start meals with vegetables or soup
- Drink water before and during meals
- Eat protein first
- Slow down (takes 20 min to feel full)
- Use smaller plates

**Managing Hunger:**
- Some hunger is normal during a cut
- Constant extreme hunger = deficit too aggressive
- If starving all day, add 100-200 calories back`,

      title: 'Common Cutting Mistakes',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Mistake 1: Cutting Too Aggressively**
More than 1% bodyweight per week = muscle loss territory.

**Mistake 2: Not Enough Protein**
Protein protects muscle. Skimp on it and you'll look worse, not better.

**Mistake 3: Dropping Calories Too Fast**
Start moderate. You can always reduce more later. Can't undo metabolic adaptation.

**Mistake 4: Too Much Cardio**
Cardio helps but isn't required. If you're doing 2 hours daily, something's wrong with your diet.

**Mistake 5: Weekend Blowouts**
One big cheat day can erase a week of deficit. Controlled refeeds > binges.

**Mistake 6: Neglecting Training**
Keep lifting heavy. Muscle retention requires stimulus. Don't switch to "toning" workouts.`,

      title: 'Your Cutting Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Week 1-2: Setup**
- Calculate maintenance and set 400cal deficit
- Hit 1g/lb protein daily
- Track everything

**Weeks 3-8: Execute**
- Target 0.5-1lb loss per week
- Adjust calories every 2-3 weeks if stalled
- Keep training intensity high

**When to Add Cardio:**
- Start with diet only
- Add 2-3 sessions of 20-30min LISS when progress stalls
- Don't exceed 4-5 sessions weekly

**When to Take a Break:**
- After 8-12 weeks of cutting
- If energy/libido crash
- Diet break: eat at maintenance for 1-2 weeks

**End Goal:**
- Get to 10-15% body fat
- Then transition to maintenance or lean bulk
- Don't cut indefinitely

**The Payoff:**
A proper cut reveals the muscle you've built. It's where all your work becomes visible.`,
