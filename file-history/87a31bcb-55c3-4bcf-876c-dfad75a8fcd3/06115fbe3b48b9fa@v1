      content: `Your internal markers dictate how lean you stay, how hard you look, and how fast you recover.

When these are optimized, you stay tighter, fuller, and sharper year-round with far less effort.

**The Key Categories:**
1. Glucose & Insulin Sensitivity
2. Inflammation (CRP & Ferritin)
3. Lipids, Hydration & Electrolytes

**Why This Matters:**
Poor control makes you look softer even at the same body fat. These markers explain why two guys at 12% body fat can look completely different.`,

      title: 'Glucose & Insulin Sensitivity',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Targets:**
- Fasting Glucose: 70-90 mg/dL
- HbA1c: 4.8-5.2
- Fasting Insulin: Low-normal range (<5 mU/L ideal)

**What Good Insulin Sensitivity Gets You:**
- Better nutrient partitioning (nutrients go to muscle, not fat)
- Tighter waistline
- Cleaner pumps
- Consistent leanness
- Better energy management

**What Poor Control Gets You:**
- Softer look even when lean
- Blood sugar crashes
- Easy fat gain
- Constant hunger

**How to Improve:**
- Lower body fat (biggest factor)
- Resistance training
- Walking after meals
- Reduce processed carbs
- Sleep 7-9 hours consistently`,

      id: 'inflammation',
      title: 'Inflammation (CRP & Ferritin)',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**CRP (C-Reactive Protein)**
- Target: <1.0 mg/L (ideal <0.5)
- Test only after 48-72 hours without training

**What High CRP Means:**
- Systemic inflammation
- Water retention (puffy, less defined)
- Slower recovery
- More "off days"

**Ferritin**
- Target: 50-150 ng/mL

**What Ferritin Shows:**
- Iron storage status
- Low = fatigue, poor performance
- High = inflammation marker

**Low inflammation = crisp definition, reduced water retention, and fewer "off days."**

Elevated markers create puffiness, fatigue, and a blurrier look even when lean.

**How to Improve:**
- Remove inflammatory foods (seed oils, processed foods)
- Improve sleep quality
- Address any chronic infections/issues
- Add omega-3 fatty acids
- Reduce alcohol`,

      title: 'Lipids, Hydration & Electrolytes',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Lipid Targets:**
- apoB: Low
- HDL: High
- Triglycerides: <100 mg/dL

**What Good Lipids Get You:**
- Better blood flow and recovery
- Reduced inflammation
- Improved nutrient delivery

**Electrolytes (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium)**
- These dictate hydration, fullness, and muscle contractions
- Electrolyte imbalance = flat muscles, poor performance, cramps

**Hydration Markers:**
- BUN/Creatinine ratio
- Healthy ratio indicates proper hydration

**When hydration and lipids are dialed in, you maintain:**
- Vein visibility
- Muscle fullness
- High pump quality
- Avoid the "watery" or "flat" look depending on the day

**How to Optimize:**
- Hydrate properly (not just water—add electrolytes)
- Don't fear salt (especially if training hard)
- 200-400mg magnesium daily
- Omega-3 fatty acids for lipid profile`,

      title: 'Your Metabolic Marker Protocol',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**Test These:**
- Fasting glucose
- Fasting insulin
- HbA1c
- CRP (high-sensitivity)
- Lipid panel (with apoB if available)
- Basic metabolic panel (includes electrolytes)

**Optimize These First:**
1. Body fat (get to 12-15%)
2. Sleep quality
3. Food quality (remove processed oils)
4. Consistent training

**Signs Your Metabolic Markers Are Off:**
- Looking puffy despite being lean
- Energy crashes throughout day
- Poor gym performance
- Slow recovery
- Constant hunger

**The Connection:**
These markers explain why some guys can stay shredded on 3000 calories while others get soft on 2000.

When glucose, insulin, and inflammation are optimized, your body becomes a more efficient machine—partitioning nutrients properly, recovering faster, and maintaining definition effortlessly.

Fix these before worrying about advanced protocols.`,
