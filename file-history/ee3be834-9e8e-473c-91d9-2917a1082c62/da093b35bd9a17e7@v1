# LOOKSMAXX

A facial metrics analysis and visualization system with Next.js frontend and MediaPipe-based facial landmark detection. Now with FaceIQ-compatible scoring and results UI.

## Current Focus
Section: Bug Fixes - Flaw Impact Calculation
Files: `src/lib/insights-engine.ts`

## Last Session (2025-12-21)

Fixed flaw impact amplification bug:
- Removed incorrect `* matchedMetrics.length` multiplier from line 2236 in insights-engine.ts
- Impact now correctly calculated as `(10 - avgScore) * 0.5` without metric count inflation
- TypeScript verification passed (test file errors not in main app)

Stopped at: Bug fixed, dev server running on port 3002

## Next Steps

1. Implement female-specific ethnicity overrides (currently TODO at lines 1038-1044 in insights-engine.ts)
2. Enhance ADVICE_DATABASE with specific procedure names (lip lift, alarplasty, etc.)
3. Add more custom Bezier curves (only 5/66 from FaceIQ implemented)
4. Implement supplement/product e-commerce layer (see `supplement_implementation.md`)
