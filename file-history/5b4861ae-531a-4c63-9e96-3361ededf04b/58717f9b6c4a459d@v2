## 2. How LOOKSMAXX Calculates "Your Potential" Scores

### Scoring Formula Components

Based on community-documented formulas, LOOKSMAXX uses four main scoring categories:

| Category | Weight | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| **HARM (Harmony)** | 32% | Proportional balance of facial features (27 characteristics including jaw width, facial thirds, eye spacing, gonial angle) |
| **DIMO (Dimorphism)** | 20% | Masculine/feminine characteristics (11 features: eye depth, brow ridge, chin structure, facial hair) |
| **ANGU (Angularity)** | 20% | Facial definition and sharpness (9 measurements: mandible visibility, cheekbone prominence, jaw contours) |
| **MISC (Miscellaneous)** | 26% | Skin quality, eye area, coloring, lower third, lips, nose, symmetry (7 categories) |

### Score Calculation Process

1. **Raw Score Calculation**: Each category has its own scale converted to 0-100
2. **Weighted Average**: `(HARM*0.32) + (MISC*0.26) + (ANGU*0.22) + (DIMO*0.20)`
3. **Balance Penalty**: Calculate spread between highest and lowest category scores; apply penalty: `spread * 0.5` subtracted from weighted average
4. **Final Rating**: Result produces 1-10 rating reflecting "balance and cohesion"

### Alternative Weighting (Some Sources)
- Harmony: 40%
- Features: 25%
- Dimorphism: 20%
- Angularity: 15%

## 3. Improvement Percentage Estimates

### Weight Loss / Leanmaxxing Impact

From user reports with LOOKSMAXX ratings:

| Change | Impact |
|--------|--------|
| Losing to 15% body fat | +1.5 points overall |
| Angularity improvement | +4 points (subscale) |
| Harmony improvement | +1 point (subscale) |
| Dimorphism improvement | +1 point (subscale) |

**Leanmaxxing effects documented:**
- Better EME (eye-mouth-eye) ratios
- Better philtrum to chin ratios
- Improved ogee curves
- Deeper canine fossa
- Better jawline visibility

### Morph Improvement Examples

From user-shared LOOKSMAXX analyses:

| Original Score | Morphed Score | Change | Modifications |
|---------------|---------------|--------|---------------|
| Top 26% harmony | Top 0.3% harmony | ~85 percentile jump | Extended nose/forehead by "a couple mm" |
| Base morph | 8.73 (top 0.002%) | Major improvement | Lowered mouth, droopier nose tip |

**Important caveat**: Users note that even with high harmony improvements, the visual difference may appear minimal due to other factors (angle, misc features).

## 4. Treatment Recommendations System

### LOOKSMAXX's "Your Plan" Features

According to official documentation:
- Personalized treatment options based on facial analysis data
- Projected potential scores after treatments
- Both surgical and non-surgical recommendations
- "Order of Operations" step-by-step plan

**Disclaimer**: All recommendations are for "educational and informational purposes only" - not medical advice.

### Example Recommendations from User Reports

One user (4/10 rating, bottom 25%) received:

**Identified Flaws:**
- Philtrum length ratio: 1.75 (ideal: 0.325-0.4)
- Upper eyelid excess (UEE)
- Facial recession
- Thin upper lip

**Recommended Procedures:**
1. Bimax (bilateral maxillary-mandibular advancement)
2. Upper eyelid fat grafting
3. Lip flip surgery
4. Jaw angle implants (post-bimax)
5. Lip lift (for philtrum correction)

**Projected outcome**: "Mid-tier normie status achievable; high-tier normie unlikely given structural limitations"

---

## 5. Order of Operations for Treatment Plans

### General Surgical Sequencing Principles

1. **Foundation First**: Address skeletal structure before soft tissue
2. **Recession Before Enhancement**: Fix recession with bimax/Le Fort before implants
3. **Nose After Jaw**: Rhinoplasty after bimax (bimax widens nose)
4. **Implants Last**: Jaw angle implants after skeletal procedures

### Typical Sequence from Community

1. **Bimax/Le Fort** (if recessed) - Foundation
2. **Genioplasty** (if needed) - Often combined with bimax as "trimax"
3. **Rhinoplasty** - After jaw has settled
4. **Implants** (jaw angle, cheek, etc.) - Fine-tuning
5. **Soft tissue procedures** - Last stage

**Example user plan**: "trimax first, then rhino, then implants, then LL [limb lengthening]" with "necessary rest periods" between.

## 6. Hardmaxxing Tier List (ROI Ranking)

### S-Tier (Highest ROI)
| Procedure | Rationale |
|-----------|-----------|
| Otoplasty | Very safe, affordable, high impact for those with flared ears |
| Fat grafting/transfer | Inexpensive, permanent, addresses common deficiencies |
| Genioplasty | Low-cost, minimal risk, often insurance-covered |
| Bimax/Trimax | Best ROI if done properly, transforms severe recession |
| Hair transplant | Minimal risk, affordable via Turkey, dramatic impact |

### A-Tier (Strong ROI)
| Procedure | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Lower eyelid retraction repair | Inexpensive, low danger |
| Implants | Quick results, customizable (infection risk) |
| Buccal fat removal | Excellent for low body-fat individuals |
| Canthoplasty/canthopexy | Affordable, may need future adjustments |
| Rhinoplasty | High impact for obvious nasal issues |
| Limb lengthening | Transformative for height (lengthy recovery) |

### B-Tier (Moderate ROI)
| Procedure | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| MSE + face pulling | Excellent orthodontics |
| Fillers/Botox | Quickest/easiest but requires maintenance |
| Lip lift | Low risk, affordable, situational |
| Chin wing osteotomy | Moderate cost, botch potential |

### C-Tier (Limited ROI)
| Procedure | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Orbital decompression | Good surgery but 1/5 botch rate |
| Brow lift | Situational effectiveness |

### D-Tier (Poor ROI)
| Procedure | Notes |
|-----------|-------|
| Clavicle lengthening | Extremely expensive, extended disability |
| Liposuction | Natural weight loss recommended instead |

## 7. Softmaxxing vs Hardmaxxing Recommendations

### Softmaxxing (Non-invasive, reversible)
**Community consensus: 50-70% of looks potential comes from softmaxxing**

| Category | Recommendations |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Skincare** | "Most important softmax" - sunscreen, tretinoin, dermarolling |
| **Leanmaxxing** | Cut to 10-15% body fat for visible bone structure |
| **Mewing** | Correct tongue posture (more effective for younger people) |
| **Minoxidil** | Oral 10x stronger than topical but heart risks; topical safer |
| **Eyebrows** | "One of highest ROI softmaxxes" - slightly darker than hair |
| **Sleep/Stress** | Reduce inflammation/cortisol for less puffiness |
| **Electrolytes** | 3:1 potassium:sodium ratio reduces facial puffiness |

### When to Hardmax

Per community consensus:
1. Complete all softmaxxing first
2. Reach natural genetic ceiling
3. Live with baseline appearance for years
4. Consult qualified professionals
5. Only proceed if specific structural issues identified

**Warning**: "Hardmaxxing is permanent, high-risk optimization that can be transformative only after full softmaxxing, but will permanently worsen your appearance if misapplied or rushed."

---

## 8. Cost-Benefit Analysis Methodology

### Factors Considered

1. **Impact** (how much improvement possible)
2. **Cost** (financial investment required)
3. **Risk** (botch rate, complications, reversibility)
4. **Recovery** (downtime, healing period)
5. **Specificity** (how many people actually need it)

### Pound-for-Pound Analysis

User argument: "Tier lists should consider cost into their rankings."

Example: While geniplasty/bimax is top-tier for impact, rhinoplasty for a bulbous nose "is a fraction of the cost" so ranks higher on value basis.

### Risk-Adjusted Returns

| Procedure | Impact | Risk | Value Assessment |
|-----------|--------|------|------------------|
| Bimax | Very High | Moderate | High value IF indicated |
| Rhinoplasty | High | Moderate | High value for obvious issues |
| Orbital decompression | High | High (1/5 botch) | Lower value due to risk |
| Fat grafting | Moderate | Low | Good value |

## 9. Accuracy & Reliability Concerns

### User-Reported Issues with LOOKSMAXX

| Concern | Details |
|---------|---------|
| **Score inflation** | "It heavily overrates if anything" - some report subtracting 1.5 points |
| **Landmark placement** | Incorrect placement leads to inflated scores |
| **Feature limitations** | "None of these apps take into account shape and tightness of each feature" |
| **Inconsistency** | Same user got scores from 4/10 to 6.29/10 depending on photo conditions |
| **Deep-set eyes** | Tool requires guessing for hidden upper eyelids |
| **Gonial angle mapping** | Difficult to accurately mark on photos |

### Reliability Tips from Users

1. Run 3-4 tests and exclude outliers
2. Avoid 2x zoom (causes score deflation)
3. Follow landmark placement instructions carefully
4. Use consistent lighting and angle
5. Consider scores as estimates, not absolutes

---

## 10. Morphing/Simulation Methodology

### What LOOKSMAXX Provides

- Custom morph showing potential changes
- Before/after comparison
- Estimated score change with modifications

### Technical Approach (Inferred)

1. Identify facial features below ideal ratios
2. Digitally adjust those features toward ideal values
3. Recalculate harmony score on morphed image
4. Calculate percentage improvement

### Limitations

- Morphs may not be surgically achievable
- Example: "probably lefort 1/2 or genio" suggested for one morph, user clarified changes involved "midface height and forehead height" - not directly surgically addressable
- Visual improvement may appear minimal despite large score improvement

---

## 11. Implementation Recommendations for LOOKSMAXX App

### Potential Score Calculation

```typescript
interface PotentialScoreParams {
  currentScore: number;
  identifiedFlaws: Flaw[];
  availableTreatments: Treatment[];
}

interface Treatment {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  targetFlaw: string;
  estimatedImprovement: number; // 0-100 scale
  difficulty: 'softmax' | 'hardmax';
  cost: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  risk: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high';
  recovery: number; // weeks
}
```

### Suggested Improvement Estimates

| Treatment Type | Score Impact |
|----------------|--------------|
| Leanmaxxing (to 10-15% BF) | +0.5 to +1.5 points |
| Skincare optimization | +0.1 to +0.3 points |
| Mewing (young users) | +0.1 to +0.5 points |
| Rhinoplasty | +0.3 to +1.0 points |
| Bimax (if recessed) | +0.5 to +2.0 points |
| Genioplasty | +0.2 to +0.8 points |
| Jaw angle implants | +0.2 to +0.5 points |

### Order of Operations Algorithm

```typescript
function prioritizeTreatments(flaws: Flaw[]): Treatment[] {
  // 1. Softmax first
  const softmax = flaws.filter(f => f.treatableWith === 'softmax');

  // 2. Skeletal foundation
  const skeletal = ['bimax', 'lefort', 'genioplasty'];

  // 3. Nose after jaw
  const nasal = ['rhinoplasty'];

  // 4. Implants after skeletal
  const implants = ['jaw_angle', 'cheek', 'chin'];

  // 5. Soft tissue last
  const softTissue = ['lip_lift', 'blepharoplasty'];

  return [...softmax, ...skeletal, ...nasal, ...implants, ...softTissue];
}
```
