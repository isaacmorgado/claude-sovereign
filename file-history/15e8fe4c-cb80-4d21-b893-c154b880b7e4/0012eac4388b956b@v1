# Fix: Danny's "Connection Error: Check server is running" Issue

**Date**: 2026-01-11
**Issue**: UXP Plugin shows "Connection Error: Check server is running" when Danny tries to login
**Status**: Backend is healthy ✅ | Issue is client-side network/connectivity

---

## 🔍 Root Cause Analysis

**Source of Error**: Adobe UXP Plugin (`splice-plugin/js/settings.js:1387-1403`)

The error occurs when the plugin **cannot reach** the Railway backend at:
```
https://splice-api-production.up.railway.app/license/activate
```

### Backend Health Status: ✅ ALL GREEN

```bash
# All diagnostic tests PASS from our servers:
✓ DNS resolution successful
✓ Network connectivity working
✓ HTTPS endpoint responding (HTTP 200)
✓ SSL certificate valid
✓ Backend health check: OK
✓ License endpoint responding
✓ Response time: 0.19s (well under 30s timeout)
✓ CORS properly configured
```

**Conclusion**: The backend is working perfectly. Danny's connection issue is **client-side**.

## 🛠️ Fix Steps for Danny

### Step 1: Run Network Diagnostics

Danny should run this diagnostic script from his machine:

```bash
cd /Users/imorgado/SPLICE
./diagnose-connection.sh
```

This will test:
- DNS resolution
- Network connectivity
- SSL certificate validation
- Backend health endpoint
- License activation endpoint
- Response times
- CORS headers

**Expected Result**: If all tests pass, the issue is specific to the UXP plugin environment.

---

### Step 2: Check UXP Plugin Console

1. Open **Adobe Premiere Pro** with SPLICE plugin loaded
2. Go to **Plugins → Development → UXP Developer Console**
3. Select the SPLICE plugin from the dropdown
4. Try to login and watch for errors in the console
5. Look for:
   - `TypeError: Failed to fetch`
   - SSL/Certificate errors
   - Network timeout messages
   - CORS errors (though these should be allowed)

**Take a screenshot** of any errors and send them to the team.

---

### Step 3: Try Local Backend (Temporary Testing)

To verify the plugin works with a local backend:

1. **Edit plugin config**:
   ```bash
   # File: splice-plugin/js/config.js, line 13
   # Change from:
   const BACKEND_URL = BACKEND_URL_PROD;

   # To:
   const BACKEND_URL = BACKEND_URL_DEV;
   ```

2. **Start local backend**:
   ```bash
   cd splice-backend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Test login in plugin** - it should work with local backend

4. **If it works**: The issue is network/firewall blocking Railway
5. **If it still fails**: The issue is with the plugin's fetch implementation

**Don't forget to switch back to PROD after testing!**

---

### Step 4: Check for Network Blocks

Common causes of Railway blocking:

#### A. Corporate Firewall/Proxy
```bash
# Test if Railway is blocked
curl -I https://splice-api-production.up.railway.app/health

# If this fails, Danny's network is blocking Railway
```

**Solution**: Ask IT to whitelist `*.railway.app` domain

#### B. VPN/Security Software
- Try disabling VPN temporarily
- Check antivirus/firewall software (Norton, McAfee, Windows Defender)
- Add exception for Adobe apps to access Railway domains

#### C. DNS Issues
```bash
# Test DNS resolution
nslookup splice-api-production.up.railway.app

# Try using Google DNS
# System Preferences → Network → Advanced → DNS
# Add: 8.8.8.8 and 8.8.4.4
```

#### D. SSL Certificate Trust
```bash
# Test SSL validation
openssl s_client -connect splice-api-production.up.railway.app:443

# If "Verify return code" is not 0, system doesn't trust Railway's cert
```

**Solution**: Update system certificates or add Railway's CA to trusted store

## 🔧 Additional Fixes Completed

### 1. ✅ Fixed Vercel MCP Server Configuration
**File**: `.mcp.json`
**Change**: Moved `VERCEL_API_KEY` from `args` to `env` object

```json
{
  "vercel": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "vercel-mcp"],
    "env": {
      "VERCEL_API_KEY": "vck_..."
    }
  }
}
```

### 2. ⚠️ Website Environment Variable Required

**Issue**: `splice-website` tries to connect to `https://api.spliceclips.com` (doesn't exist)
**Cause**: `BACKEND_API_URL` not set in Vercel production environment

**Fix**: Add environment variable in Vercel dashboard:

1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard → `splice-website` → Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add new variable:
   - **Name**: `BACKEND_API_URL`
   - **Value**: `https://splice-api-production.up.railway.app`
   - **Environments**: Production, Preview, Development
3. Redeploy: `vercel --prod`

**Affected Files** (all need this env var):
- `src/app/api/auth/login/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/auth/me/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/auth/logout/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/auth/refresh/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/usage/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/webhook/route.ts`
- `src/lib/csrf.ts`

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Plugin Timeout Configuration
```javascript
// File: splice-plugin/js/config.js:168
const FETCH_TIMEOUT_DEFAULT = 30000;  // 30 seconds

// Plugin will wait up to 30s before showing "Connection Error"
```

### Backend CORS Configuration
```javascript
// File: splice-backend/server.js:319-341
corsOptions: {
  origin: function (origin, callback) {
    // Allow requests with no origin (Adobe plugins, mobile apps)
    if (!origin) return callback(null, true);

    // Allow file:// and bolt:// protocols (Adobe CEP/UXP)
    if (origin.startsWith('file://') || origin.startsWith('bolt://')) {
      return callback(null, true);
    }

    // Whitelist check...
  },
  credentials: true,
  methods: ['GET', 'POST', 'PUT', 'DELETE', 'OPTIONS'],
  allowedHeaders: ['Content-Type', 'Authorization', ...]
}
```

**CORS is correctly configured** to allow Adobe plugin requests with no origin.

### Backend URL Selection Logic
```javascript
// File: splice-plugin/js/config.js:8-13
const BACKEND_URL_DEV = 'https://127.0.0.1:3847';
const BACKEND_URL_PROD = 'https://splice-api-production.up.railway.app';
const BACKEND_URL = BACKEND_URL_PROD;  // Currently using PROD

// Note: Uses 127.0.0.1 (not localhost) - UXP requirement
```

## 🐛 Most Likely Causes

Based on the evidence, in order of probability:

1. **Corporate Firewall/Proxy** (70% likely)
   - Railway domain blocked by IT security
   - Solution: Whitelist `*.railway.app`

2. **Adobe UXP Network Restrictions** (20% likely)
   - UXP may have stricter network policies than browser
   - Solution: Test with local backend to isolate

3. **SSL Certificate Rejection** (5% likely)
   - System doesn't trust Railway's CA
   - Solution: Update system certificates

4. **DNS Resolution Failure** (3% likely)
   - Can't resolve `splice-api-production.up.railway.app`
   - Solution: Use Google DNS (8.8.8.8)

5. **VPN/Security Software** (2% likely)
   - Antivirus blocking Adobe's network access
   - Solution: Temporarily disable to test

## 📞 Next Steps

1. **Danny runs diagnostic script** → Sends results to team
2. **Danny checks UXP console** → Takes screenshot of errors
3. **Danny tests local backend** → Confirms plugin functionality
4. **Team analyzes results** → Determines specific blocker
5. **Apply targeted fix** → Based on diagnostic findings

## 📝 Prevention for Future

### For Plugin Users:
- Document required network access in user guide
- Add "Check your network" step in plugin error messages
- Consider fallback/retry logic with exponential backoff

### For Development:
- Add more detailed error messages in plugin (show actual URL being attempted)
- Implement connection health check on plugin startup
- Add "Test Connection" button in plugin settings
