## Use Case Decision Tree

### Scenario 1: "I want to browse a website and analyze it"

**INTERACTIVE exploration?**
→ Use Roo Code's browser_action
```
You: "Browse example.com and analyze the pricing page"
Roo Code: *Uses Puppeteer + vision to navigate and analyze*
```

**AUTOMATED with abliterated analysis?**
→ Use our custom solution
```bash
python3 browser_automation.py screenshot-to-code https://example.com/pricing
# Uses abliterated RunPod model for analysis
```

### Scenario 2: "I need to login to my account"

**ONE-TIME login for quick task?**
→ Use Roo Code with remote mode:
```bash
# Start Chrome in debug mode
chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir="chrome-debug"
# Login manually in this Chrome
# Then use Roo Code browser_action in remote mode
```

**PERSISTENT login for repeated use?**
→ Use our custom solution:
```bash
# First time: login manually, cookies saved
python3 browser_automation.py login-and-scrape my_google google https://mail.google.com

# Every time after: auto-logged in!
python3 browser_automation.py login-and-scrape my_google google https://mail.google.com
```

### Scenario 3: "Screenshot to code"

**INTERACTIVE with vision model?**
→ Use Roo Code:
```
You: "Take a screenshot of example.com and convert to code"
Roo Code: *Uses vision model to describe + generate code in one step*
```

**ABLITERATED code generation?**
→ Use our custom solution:
```bash
python3 browser_automation.py screenshot-to-code https://example.com
# GPT-4V describes → RunPod abliterated generates code
```

### Scenario 4: "Debug my app with DevTools"

**QUICK console log check?**
→ Use Roo Code (has basic console tracking)

**DEEP debugging (console + network + errors)?**
→ Use our custom solution:
```bash
python3 browser_automation.py devtools-debug http://localhost:3000
# Captures everything, analyzes with abliterated Architect model
```

### Scenario 5: "Daily scraping workflow"

**ONE-OFF scrape?**
→ Use Roo Code interactively

**DAILY automated scraping?**
→ Use our custom solution:
```bash
# Add to cron job
0 9 * * * python3 /Users/imorgado/browser_automation.py login-and-scrape my_reddit reddit https://reddit.com/r/programming
```

## Hybrid Workflow: Best of Both

**Recommended approach: Use BOTH together**

### Example: Building a competitor analysis tool

**Step 1: Exploration (Roo Code)**
```
You: "Browse acme-competitor.com and identify their pricing tiers"
Roo Code: *Uses browser_action with vision*
Roo Code: "I found 3 tiers: Basic ($9), Pro ($29), Enterprise (custom)"
```

**Step 2: Automated Monitoring (Our Scripts)**
```bash
# Set up daily scraping
cat > check_competitor.sh <<EOF
#!/bin/bash
python3 browser_automation.py screenshot-to-code https://acme-competitor.com/pricing pricing_\$(date +%Y%m%d).png
python3 runpod_api.py ask research "Analyze if pricing changed from yesterday"
EOF

# Add to cron
crontab -e
0 9 * * * /Users/imorgado/check_competitor.sh
```

**Step 3: Deep Analysis (Our Scripts + Abliterated Models)**
```bash
# Get uncensored competitive analysis
python3 runpod_api.py ask research "Compare our pricing to competitors. Be brutally honest about our weaknesses."
# ✅ Abliterated model gives uncensored analysis
```

## When Each Solution Shines

### Roo Code's browser_action Shines At:

1. **Interactive website testing**
   - "Check if login form works"
   - "Find all broken links"
   - "Test mobile responsiveness"

2. **UI exploration with vision**
   - "What color is their CTA button?"
   - "Find all images on this page"
   - Vision model identifies elements automatically

3. **Quick one-off tasks**
   - "Screenshot this page"
   - "Click the signup button and fill the form"

### Our Custom Solution Shines At:

1. **Abliterated/uncensored analysis** ⭐
   - Competitive intelligence
   - Psychological pattern analysis
   - Uncensored research
   - Reverse engineering

   - Login once, use forever
   - Multiple accounts (work/personal)
   - Different sites (Google/Reddit/Twitter)

3. **Deep debugging**
   - Full DevTools capture
   - Console + network + errors
   - Architect model analysis

4. **Automated workflows**
   - Daily scraping
   - Scheduled monitoring
   - Cron jobs
   - CI/CD integration

5. **Screenshot-to-code with abliterated models**
   - GPT-4V describes UI
   - RunPod abliterated generates code
   - No censorship in code generation
