# LOOKSMAXX

A facial metrics analysis and visualization system with Next.js frontend and MediaPipe-based facial landmark detection. Now with FaceIQ-compatible scoring and results UI.

## Current Focus
Section: FaceIQ Parity - Hierarchical Taxonomy UI
Files: `src/lib/taxonomy.ts`, `src/components/results/tabs/RatiosTab.tsx`, `src/types/results.ts`, `src/contexts/ResultsContext.tsx`

## Last Session (2025-12-21)

Implemented hierarchical UI filtering for FaceIQ taxonomy system:
- Created `src/lib/taxonomy.ts` with 4 primary categories (Harmony 36%, Dimorphism 20%, Angularity 19%, Features 25%)
- Added 23 subcategories with pattern-based metric classification
- Updated RatiosTab.tsx with HierarchicalCategoryFilter component (2-tier drill-down)
- Integrated automatic taxonomy classification for all metrics in ResultsContext
- Verified bug status: Found 1 bug (flaw impact amplification in insights-engine.ts:2236), verified ethnicity overrides working (17/17 tests passed), verified math pipeline safe (10/10 tests passed)

Stopped at: Hierarchical filtering implemented and working, dev server running successfully

## Next Steps

1. Fix flaw impact amplification bug in `src/lib/insights-engine.ts:2236` (remove `* matchedMetrics.length`)
2. Implement female-specific ethnicity overrides (currently TODO at lines 1038-1044)
3. Enhance ADVICE_DATABASE with specific procedure names (lip lift, alarplasty, etc.)
4. Add more custom Bezier curves (only 5/66 from FaceIQ implemented)
5. Implement supplement/product e-commerce layer (see `supplement_implementation.md`)
