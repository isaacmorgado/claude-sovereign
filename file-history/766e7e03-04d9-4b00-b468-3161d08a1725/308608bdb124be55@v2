## Last Session (2025-12-19)

**Phase 3 - Preview Mode Implementation:**
- Added preview UI section with CSS styling in index.html
- Modified silence workflow to show preview before applying
- Silence preview shows selectable list with checkboxes
- Added "Select All" toggle for bulk selection
- Added seek-to-silence button (>) to jump to that point on timeline
- Apply/Cancel buttons with dynamic "Apply N Selected" text
- Preview state management with `previewSilences` and `selectedSilenceIndices`
- Plugin now v3.1

**Preview Workflow:**
1. Click GO → exports audio → detects silences
2. Shows preview with all silences (checkboxes checked by default)
3. User can uncheck silences to exclude, click seek to preview
4. Click "Apply Selected" → applies only selected silences
5. Shows results with undo option

**Stopped at:** Phase 3 complete, plugin v3.1 ready

## Next Steps
1. Phase 4: Smart Filtering (auto-exclude false positives)
2. Add customer ID input in settings modal
3. Usage history display
4. Takes preview mode (similar workflow for takes detection)
