# SPLICE Quick Edit Hotfix - Installation Guide for Danny
## Version 6.0.10 - Critical Bug Fix
## Date: January 15, 2026

---

## 🎯 What This Fixes

**The Bug:** Quick Edit fails with "Please open a sequence in the timeline first" error, even when you have a sequence open.

**Root Cause:** The plugin incorrectly rejects sequences with ID = 0 (first sequence in a project).

**The Fix:** One-line code change that accepts sequenceID = 0 as valid.

```

4. Click "Go"

**Windows:**
1. Open File Explorer
2. Paste into address bar: `C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\extensions\`
3. Press Enter

---

### Step 3: Backup Old Version (Optional but Recommended)

1. In the extensions folder, find: `com.splice.panel`
2. **Rename it to:** `com.splice.panel.OLD` (for backup)
3. Or delete it if you're confident

---

### Step 4: Install Hotfix

1. **Extract** `SPLICE-CEP-v6.0.10-HOTFIX-Danny.zip`
2. You should see a folder named `com.splice.panel`
3. **Copy** this folder into the CEP extensions directory
4. Final path should be:
   - **Mac:** `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/com.splice.panel/`
   - **Windows:** `C:\...\CEP\extensions\com.splice.panel\`

---

### Step 5: Verify Installation

Check that these files exist:

```
com.splice.panel/
  ├── CSXS/
  │   └── manifest.xml (should say version 6.0.10)
  ├── jsx/
  │   ├── hostScript.jsx (contains the fix)
  │   └── jsxUtils.jsx
  ├── panel/
  │   ├── index.html
  │   ├── css/
  │   └── js/
  └── .debug (optional)
```

### Step 6: Restart Premiere Pro

1. **Open Premiere Pro**
2. **Open or create a project**
3. **Go to:** Window → Extensions → SPLICE - AI Video Editor
4. **Check version:** Look at the bottom of the panel - should say `v6.0.10`

---

### Step 7: Test Quick Edit

1. **Create or open a sequence**
2. **Add some clips with audio** (if not already there)
3. **Click the Quick Edit button**
4. **Expected:** Should work now! ✅
5. **If it fails:** See troubleshooting below

---

## ✅ How to Confirm It's Fixed

```
SPLICE v6.0.10  ← Bottom of panel
```

**When Clicking Quick Edit:**
```
✅ No "Please open a sequence" error
✅ Audio export begins
✅ Processing starts
✅ Feature works as expected
```

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Still Getting "Please Open Sequence" Error

**Check:**
1. Is the version actually 6.0.10? (bottom of panel)
2. Did you fully quit Premiere Pro before installing?
3. Is your sequence actually open in the Timeline?

**Try:**
- Quit Premiere Pro completely
- Delete `com.splice.panel` folder
- Re-extract and copy hotfix
- Restart Premiere Pro

---

### Issue 2: Panel Doesn't Load

**Check:**
1. Is PlayerDebugMode enabled?
   ```bash
   # Mac:
   defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11 PlayerDebugMode 1

   # Windows (run in admin PowerShell):
   [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("CSXS_PlayerDebugMode", "1", "User")
   ```

2. Are the files in the right location?
   - Must be in `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/`
   - NOT in user's Library folder

---

### Issue 3: Wrong Version Showing

**Problem:** Panel shows v6.0.9 instead of v6.0.10

**Solution:**
1. You may have multiple installations
2. Search for ALL `com.splice.panel` folders:
   ```bash
   # Mac:
   sudo find /Library -name "com.splice.panel" 2>/dev/null

   # Windows PowerShell:
   Get-ChildItem -Path "C:\Program Files (x86)" -Filter "com.splice.panel" -Recurse
   ```
3. Delete all old versions
4. Install hotfix in correct location

---

### Issue 4: Permission Denied (Mac)

**Problem:** Can't copy files to `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/`

**Solution:**
1. Use `sudo` in Terminal:
   ```bash
   sudo cp -R /path/to/com.splice.panel /Library/Application\ Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/
   ```
2. Enter your Mac password when prompted

   - **Before:** `if (seq.name && seq.sequenceID) {`
