# Project Code Quality Check

This command runs all linting and typechecking tools for this monorepo, collects errors, groups them by domain, and spawns parallel agents to fix them.

## Step 1: Run Linting and Typechecking

Run the following commands to check for issues:

```bash
# Run TypeScript type checking across all packages
pnpm run check-types 2>&1 || true

# Run ESLint across all packages
pnpm run lint 2>&1 || true
```

## Step 2: Collect and Parse Errors

Parse the output from the linting and typechecking commands. Group errors by domain:
- **Type errors**: Issues from TypeScript (`pnpm run check-types`)
- **Lint errors**: Issues from ESLint (`pnpm run lint`)

Create a list of all files with issues and the specific problems in each file.

## Step 3: Spawn Parallel Agents

For each domain that has issues, spawn an agent in parallel using the Task tool:

**IMPORTANT**: Use a SINGLE response with MULTIPLE Task tool calls to run agents in parallel.

Example:
- Spawn a "type-fixer" agent for type errors with subagent_type="general-purpose"
- Spawn a "lint-fixer" agent for lint errors with subagent_type="general-purpose"

Each agent should:
1. Receive the list of files and specific errors in their domain
2. Fix all errors in their domain
3. Run the relevant check command to verify fixes:
   - Type errors: `pnpm run check-types`
   - Lint errors: `pnpm run lint`
4. Report completion

## Step 4: Verify All Fixes

After all agents complete, run the full check again to ensure all issues are resolved:

```bash
pnpm run check-types && pnpm run lint
```

If issues remain, report them to the user.
