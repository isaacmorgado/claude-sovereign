# MultiAgent Workspace Configuration
# This file configures multi-project support for MultiAgent.
# Copy to .multiagent/workspaces.yaml and customize for your project.

version: "1.0"

# Workspace configurations
# Each workspace can have its own agent settings
workspaces:
  # First workspace - main project
  - workspacePath: "${workspaceFolder}"
    enabled: true
    defaultMode: code              # Default mode slug for this workspace
    defaultProviderProfile: default # Default API provider profile
    isolatedContext: true          # Whether to isolate context from other workspaces
    maxConcurrentTasks: 1          # Max parallel tasks for this workspace

  # Second workspace - shared library (example for multi-root)
  # Uncomment if using a multi-root workspace
  # - workspacePath: "${workspaceFolder:1}"
  #   enabled: true
  #   defaultMode: code
  #   isolatedContext: true
  #   maxConcurrentTasks: 1

# Cross-project orchestration settings (optional)
orchestration:
  enabled: false
  orchestratorMode: architect      # Custom mode for orchestrator agent

  # Project dependencies define the order of operations
  # When running cross-project tasks, dependencies are executed first
  projectDependencies:
    # Example: frontend depends on shared library
    # "${workspaceFolder}":
    #   - "${workspaceFolder:1}"  # shared library

  # Shared context patterns
  # Files matching these patterns are shared across workspaces
  sharedContext:
    - "**/*.d.ts"                  # TypeScript declarations
    - "**/package.json"            # Package manifests
