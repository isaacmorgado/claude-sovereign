# Claude Code Memory System Enhancement

Memory system Phases 2-4 integration into /auto mode.

## Current Focus
Section: Memory retrieval accuracy improvements
Files: ~/.claude/hooks/memory-manager.sh, ~/.claude/hooks/agent-loop.sh, ~/.claude/hooks/coordinator.sh, ~/.claude/hooks/auto-continue.sh

## Last Session (2026-01-12)
- ✅ Implemented Phases 2-4 in memory-manager.sh (+586 lines)
- ✅ Integrated hybrid search into agent-loop.sh and coordinator.sh
- ✅ Integrated context budgeting into agent-loop.sh and auto-continue.sh
- ✅ Created verification script (28/28 checks passed)
- ✅ Completed research on memory retrieval (95%+ accuracy via hybrid search + RRF)
- ✅ Completed research on parallel agent execution patterns
- ✅ Enhanced RRF function to combine 4 ranking signals (BM25, relevance, recency, importance)
- Stopped at: Testing enhanced RRF implementation

## Next Steps
1. Verify auto-compact integration is working correctly
2. Test complete /auto workflow with all phases
3. Ensure /checkpoint is automatically used in /auto process
