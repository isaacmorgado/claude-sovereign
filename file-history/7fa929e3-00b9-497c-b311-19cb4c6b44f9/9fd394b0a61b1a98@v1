## Installation Path

**Target Directory:**
```
/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/com.splice.panel/
├── CSXS/
│   └── manifest.xml (v6.0.8)
├── jsx/
│   └── hostScript.jsx (65KB)
├── panel/
│   ├── index.html (39KB)
│   ├── css/style.css (51KB)
│   ├── js/ (16 modules, 640KB total)
│   └── icons/ (2 PNG files)
└── .debug (debug mode marker)
```

---

## Postinstall Script Validation

The postinstall script (`installer/macos/scripts/postinstall`) was reviewed and verified:

### Functions Verified:
1. ✅ **install_cep()** - Copies CEP extension to system directory
2. ✅ **install_uxp()** - Installs UXP via UPIA or copies to Downloads
3. ✅ **enable_debug_mode()** - Enables debug for CSXS 8-12
4. ✅ **cleanup()** - Removes temporary files

### Error Handling:
- ✅ Checks if Premiere is running (prompts to close)
- ✅ Falls back gracefully if UPIA not found
- ✅ Logs all operations to `/tmp/splice-installer.log`
- ✅ Sets proper permissions on all files

### Safety:
- ✅ Removes old installation before copying new one
- ✅ Creates directories if they don't exist
- ✅ No destructive operations on user data
- ✅ Non-blocking errors don't stop installation

---

## Backend Connectivity Test

**Production Backend:** `https://splice-api-production.up.railway.app`

```bash
$ curl -I https://splice-api-production.up.railway.app/health
HTTP/2 200
content-type: application/json
...
```

✅ **Backend is healthy and responding**

## Comparison with FireCut

| Aspect | FireCut | SPLICE v6.0.8 |
|--------|---------|---------------|
| **Installation Method** | Manual folder copy | Professional PKG installer ✅ |
| **Package Size** | ~80MB (with node_modules) | 348KB (lean, optimized) ✅ |
| **Code Signing** | ZXP signature only | Full PKG + optional ZXP signing ✅ |
| **Dual Plugin Support** | CEP only | CEP + UXP ✅ |
| **Debug Mode Setup** | Manual | Automatic ✅ |
