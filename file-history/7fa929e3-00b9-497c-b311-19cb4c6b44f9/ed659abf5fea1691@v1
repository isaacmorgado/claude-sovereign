# SPLICE v6.0.8 - Quick Fix Summary for Danny

## 🎯 What Was Fixed

**Your Issue**: Pressing "Quick Edit" (GO button) showed "Please open a sequence" error even when a sequence WAS already open.

**The Fix**: Streamlined the sequence detection code from 80 lines down to 38 lines, removing excessive logging that was causing timing issues.
