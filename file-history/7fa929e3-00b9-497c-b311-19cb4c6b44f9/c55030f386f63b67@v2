# SPLICE vs FireCut: Installer Comparison & Enhancement Report

**Date:** January 12, 2026
**Version:** SPLICE 6.0.8
**Comparison Target:** FireCut v1.2.4

---

## Executive Summary

After conducting a comprehensive analysis of FireCut's installation approach, we've enhanced SPLICE's installer system while maintaining our superior professional architecture. This document outlines the key differences, improvements made, and strategic advantages.

### Key Finding

**FireCut has NO automated installer** - they provide a manual folder copy approach with a README file. SPLICE's PKG installer is significantly more professional and user-friendly.

## Installation Approach Comparison

| Aspect | FireCut | SPLICE |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Distribution Method** | Manual folder copy | Automated PKG installer |
| **User Experience** | Technical (requires file system navigation) | Professional (one-click install) |
| **Installation Process** | Copy `com.firecut.base` to CEP extensions folder | Double-click PKG, automated deployment |
| **Code Signing** | ZXP signature only (META-INF) | Full macOS Developer ID + notarization |
| **Gatekeeper Compatibility** | May show warnings | Passes Gatekeeper validation |
| **Pre-flight Checks** | None | Premiere running check, disk space validation |
| **Platform Support** | macOS + Windows (same manual approach) | macOS PKG + Windows NSIS installer |
| **Uninstaller** | Manual deletion | Automated uninstall script with logging |
| **Dual Plugin Support** | CEP only | CEP + UXP in single installer |

## Technical Improvements Learned from FireCut

While FireCut's installer is inferior, their package structure revealed some industry practices we've adopted:

### 1. ZXP Signing (Enhanced)

**FireCut's Approach:**
- Includes `META-INF/signatures.xml` (395KB signature)
- Proper ZXP format for Adobe Exchange distribution
- Uses self-signed or commercial certificate

**SPLICE's Enhancement:**
```bash
# New capability added to build-zxp.sh
./installer/scripts/build-zxp.sh --sign

# Features:
# - Auto-generates self-signed cert for development
# - Supports production certificates
# - Creates proper META-INF structure
# - Timestamping with DigiCert
# - Verification and validation
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Enables Adobe Exchange distribution
- ✅ Adds trust layer for enterprise deployments
- ✅ Matches industry standard ZXP format
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with unsigned builds

### 2. JSXBin Compilation (Optional)

**FireCut's Approach:**
- Compiles `host/index.jsxbin` from JSX source
- Binary format prevents casual code inspection
- Light IP protection for ExtendScript

**SPLICE's Enhancement:**
```bash
# New capability added (framework ready)
./installer/scripts/build-zxp.sh --jsxbin

# Currently shows informative warning:
# - Requires Adobe ExtendScript Toolkit
# - Alternative: estk-compile utility
# - Not critical for SPLICE's backend-driven architecture
```

**Decision:**
- ⚠️ **Not enabled by default** - SPLICE's security model relies on backend API
- ⚠️ Source code readability aids debugging for users
- ⚠️ FireCut needs obfuscation due to client-side license validation
- ✅ Available as option for future use

### 3. Self-Contained Packaging

**FireCut's Approach:**
- Bundles all 204 node_modules (puppeteer, cheerio, jimp, etc.)
- Total package size: ~80MB+ uncompressed
- Enables offline functionality
- Includes Chrome engine for web scraping

**SPLICE's Approach:**
- Lean package: 172KB (CEP) + 143KB (UXP)
- Depends on backend API for AI features
- No offline capability, but more secure
- Faster updates (no client-side updates needed)

**Trade-off Analysis:**

| Approach | Pros | Cons |
|----------|------|------|
| **Self-Contained (FireCut)** | Offline mode, faster startup | Large download, security risks, hard to update |
| **Backend API (SPLICE)** | Small package, secure, easy updates | Requires internet, backend dependency |

**Decision:** Keep SPLICE's backend-driven architecture - it's more secure and maintainable.
