# Dependency Update & Deprecation Fix

## Step 1: Check for Updates

```bash
npm outdated
```

Review which packages have updates available (Current vs Wanted vs Latest).

## Step 2: Update Dependencies

```bash
npm update
npm audit fix
```

Apply available updates and fix security vulnerabilities automatically.

## Step 3: Check for Deprecations & Warnings

Run a fresh install and capture ALL output:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install 2>&1
```

Read ALL output carefully. Look for:
- Deprecation warnings (e.g., "npm WARN deprecated")
- Security vulnerabilities (e.g., "X vulnerabilities")
- Peer dependency warnings
- Breaking changes

## Step 4: Fix Issues

For each warning/deprecation found:
1. Research the recommended replacement or fix
2. Update package.json with the new package version
3. Re-run `npm install`
4. Verify the warning is resolved

Common fixes:
- Replace deprecated packages with their successors
- Update peer dependencies to compatible versions
- Add missing peer dependencies

## Step 5: Run Quality Checks

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm test
```

Fix all errors before completing. The build and tests must pass.

## Step 6: Verify Clean Install

Ensure a completely fresh install works with zero issues:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
npm run build
```

**Success criteria:**
- ZERO deprecation warnings
- ZERO vulnerability warnings (or only low-severity that can't be fixed)
- Build completes successfully
- All tests pass
