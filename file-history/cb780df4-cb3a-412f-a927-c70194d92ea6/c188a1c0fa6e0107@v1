# Project Code Quality Check

## Step 1: Run Linting and Typechecking

```bash
cd looksmaxx-app && npm run lint
cd looksmaxx-app && npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Step 2: Collect and Parse Errors

Parse the output from linting and typechecking. Group errors by domain:
- **Type errors**: TypeScript compiler errors
- **Lint errors**: ESLint issues

Create a list of all files with issues and specific problems in each.

## Step 3: Spawn Parallel Agents

For each domain with issues, spawn agents in parallel using the Task tool.

**IMPORTANT**: Use a SINGLE response with MULTIPLE Task tool calls to run agents in parallel.

- Spawn a "type-fixer" agent for TypeScript errors
- Spawn a "lint-fixer" agent for ESLint errors

Each agent should:
1. Receive files and specific errors in their domain
2. Fix all errors
3. Re-run the check to verify fixes
4. Report completion

## Step 4: Verify All Fixes

After agents complete, run full checks again:

```bash
cd looksmaxx-app && npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit
```

Ensure all issues are resolved.
