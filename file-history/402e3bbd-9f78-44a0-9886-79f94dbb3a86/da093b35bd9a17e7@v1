# LOOKSMAXX

A facial metrics analysis and visualization system with Next.js frontend and MediaPipe-based facial landmark detection. Now with FaceIQ-compatible scoring and results UI.

## Current Focus
Section: Enhancement - Female Ethnicity Overrides Complete
Files: `src/lib/insights-engine.ts`

## Last Session (2025-12-21 Afternoon)

**Completed: Female-specific ethnicity overrides**
- Expanded all 8 female ethnicity overrides with full specifications (lines 1039-1399)
- Added `mean`, `std_dev`, and `flaws` properties to match male override pattern
- Ethnicities completed:
  - female_white (5 metrics)
  - female_black (4 metrics)
  - female_east_asian (4 metrics)
  - female_south_asian (4 metrics)
  - female_hispanic (4 metrics)
  - female_middle_eastern (4 metrics)
  - female_native_american (4 metrics)
  - female_pacific_islander (4 metrics)
- TypeScript verification passed (main app code error-free)

Stopped at: Female ethnicity overrides complete, dev server on port 3002

## Previous Session (2025-12-21 Morning)

Fixed flaw impact amplification bug:
- Removed incorrect `* matchedMetrics.length` multiplier from line 2236 in insights-engine.ts
- Impact now correctly calculated as `(10 - avgScore) * 0.5` without metric count inflation

## Next Steps

1. Enhance ADVICE_DATABASE with specific procedure names (lip lift, alarplasty, etc.)
2. Add more custom Bezier curves (only 5/66 from FaceIQ implemented)
3. Implement supplement/product e-commerce layer (see `supplement_implementation.md`)
4. Test female analysis flow with new overrides
