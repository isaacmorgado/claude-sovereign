# Project Code Quality Check

This command runs all linting and typechecking tools for this TypeScript project, collects errors, groups them by domain, and spawns parallel agents to fix them.

## Step 1: Run Linting and Typechecking

Run these commands to check for issues:

```bash
npm run typecheck 2>&1
npm run lint 2>&1
npm run format:check 2>&1
```

## Step 2: Collect and Parse Errors

Parse the output from the linting and typechecking commands. Group errors by domain:
- **Type errors**: Issues from TypeScript (`tsc --noEmit`)
- **Lint errors**: Issues from ESLint
- **Format errors**: Issues from Prettier

Create a list of all files with issues and the specific problems in each file.

## Step 3: Spawn Parallel Agents

For each domain that has issues, spawn an agent in parallel using the Task tool:

**IMPORTANT**: Use a SINGLE response with MULTIPLE Task tool calls to run agents in parallel.

Example agent prompts:

### Type Fixer Agent
"Fix the following TypeScript type errors. For each file, read it, fix the type issues, and verify by running `npm run typecheck`. Files and errors: [LIST]"

### Lint Fixer Agent
"Fix the following ESLint errors. For each file, read it, fix the lint issues (or run `npm run lint:fix` if auto-fixable), and verify by running `npm run lint`. Files and errors: [LIST]"

### Format Fixer Agent
"Fix the following formatting issues by running `npm run format` to auto-format all files, then verify with `npm run format:check`."

Each agent should:
1. Receive the list of files and specific errors in their domain
2. Fix all errors in their domain
3. Run the relevant check command to verify fixes
4. Report completion

## Step 4: Verify All Fixes

After all agents complete, run the full check again to ensure all issues are resolved:

```bash
npm run check
```

If any issues remain, report them to the user.
