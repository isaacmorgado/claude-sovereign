    question: "How does the 14-day free trial work?",
    answer:
      "You get full access to all features for 14 days without entering any payment information. After the trial, you can choose a plan that fits your needs or simply let it expire - no strings attached.",
  },
  {
    question: "Which versions of Premiere Pro are supported?",
    answer:
      "SPLICE supports both CEP (Premiere Pro 14.0 to 25.9) and UXP (Premiere Pro 25.6+) architectures. This means we work with virtually every modern version of Premiere Pro, and we're future-proof for Adobe's new extension system.",
  },
  {
    question: "How accurate is the AI silence detection?",
    answer:
      "Our advanced silence detection achieves 95%+ accuracy using multiple analysis methods. You can fine-tune sensitivity settings to match your content style, whether it's a fast-paced vlog or a slower tutorial.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use the AI-generated music commercially?",
    answer:
      "Yes! All music generated through SPLICE via Mureka AI is royalty-free and cleared for commercial use, including YouTube monetization, client work, and social media content.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I exceed my monthly hours?",
    answer:
      "You can continue using SPLICE with overage billing at $1/hour. We'll notify you when you're approaching your limit so there are no surprises. You can also upgrade your plan at any time.",
  },
  {
    question: "How is SPLICE different from FireCut or AutoPod?",
    answer:
      "SPLICE offers features no competitor has: AI music generation, text-based editing (delete text = delete video), and advanced face-tracking social reframe. We also support modern UXP architecture while they're limited to legacy CEP only.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my video data secure?",
    answer:
      "Your video files are processed securely and never stored permanently on our servers. Audio is extracted temporarily for transcription, then deleted within 24 hours. We're GDPR compliant and never train AI models on your content.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I cancel anytime?",
    answer:
      "Absolutely. You can cancel your subscription at any time from your account settings. You'll continue to have access until the end of your billing period, and we don't charge cancellation fees.",
