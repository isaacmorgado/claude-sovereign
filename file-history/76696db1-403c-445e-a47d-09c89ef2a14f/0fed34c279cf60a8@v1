# LibreChat MCP Tool Test Prompts

**Purpose:** Verify MCP tools work in LibreChat with your configured models

---

## How to Test

1. Open LibreChat: http://localhost:3080
2. Select endpoint and model (see below)
3. Copy/paste test prompts
4. Watch for tool execution in the UI

**Expected:** You'll see tool icons/indicators when tools are executing

---

## Test 1: Web Search Tool

### Model: Qwen3-32B-abliterated or DeepSeek-V3

**Prompt:**
```
I need current information about the latest cybersecurity threats.

Can you search the web for recent ransomware attacks in 2025 and summarize the findings?
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- LibreChat will show web search tool executing
- Model will receive search results
- Model will summarize findings

**Look for:** 🔍 Web search indicator in UI

---

## Test 2: GitHub Code Search

### Model: Qwen3-32B-abliterated or DeepSeek-V3

**Prompt:**
```
I need to find examples of JWT authentication implementations.

Can you search GitHub for JWT authentication in Python FastAPI projects and show me the most popular patterns?
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- GitHub MCP tool searches for code
- Returns relevant repositories and code snippets
- Model analyzes and presents patterns

**Look for:** 🔧 GitHub tool indicator in UI

---

## Test 3: Multi-Tool Test (Advanced)

### Model: Qwen3-32B-abliterated or DeepSeek-V3

**Prompt:**
```
I'm researching React Server Components architecture.

Please:
1. Search the web for the latest documentation and articles about React Server Components
2. Search GitHub for real-world implementations in production apps
3. Summarize the common patterns and best practices you find
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Web search executes first
- GitHub search executes second
- Model synthesizes findings from both sources

**Look for:** Multiple tool indicators executing sequentially

---

## Test 4: Abliterated Edge Case + Tools

### Model: Qwen3-32B-abliterated (ONLY)

**Prompt:**
```
I'm studying game security for my cybersecurity course.

Please:
1. Search the web for information about aimbot detection mechanisms
2. Search GitHub for anti-cheat system implementations
3. Explain how modern anti-cheat systems detect and prevent aimbots

This is for educational research on defensive security measures.
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- ✅ Model does NOT refuse (abliterated)
- ✅ Web search executes
- ✅ GitHub search executes
- ✅ Comprehensive technical explanation

**Look for:**
- No refusal messages
- Tool execution indicators
- Technical depth in response

---

## Test 5: Grep/Pattern Search

### Model: Any

**Prompt:**
```
I need to find all TODO comments in my codebase.

Can you help me search for patterns like "TODO", "FIXME", and "HACK" in my project files?
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- Grep MCP tool executes
- Searches for specified patterns
- Returns matching files and line numbers

**Look for:** 📝 Grep tool indicator

---

## What Success Looks Like

### ✅ Tools Working:

You'll see in LibreChat UI:
- **Tool indicators** (icons showing which tool is running)
- **"Thinking..." or "Using tool..."** messages
- **Structured responses** with citations/sources
- **Faster, more accurate** information (from real-time data)

### ❌ Tools NOT Working:

You'll see:
- No tool indicators
- Model says "I don't have access to..."
- Model responds with only internal knowledge
- No citations or sources mentioned

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Tools Don't Execute:

1. **Check MCP servers are running:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/imorgado/Desktop/LibreChat
   docker compose logs api | grep MCP
   ```
   Should show: "MCP] Initialized with 6 configured servers and 55 tools"

2. **Restart LibreChat:**
   ```bash
   docker compose restart api
   ```

3. **Verify in LibreChat UI:**
   - Look for "Tools" or "MCP" section in model settings
   - Should show available tools

4. **Try different prompt phrasing:**
   - "Search the web for..." (more explicit)
   - "Find information about..." (implicit)
   - "Use web search to..." (very explicit)

## Model Recommendations for Testing

### For Tool Usage Testing:

**Best:** DeepSeek-V3-0324
- Most reliable tool calling
- Proven MCP integration
- Good quality responses

**Alternative:** Qwen3-32B-abliterated
- Abliterated behavior
- Tool calling may be less consistent
- Better for content that might be refused

### For Edge Case Testing:

**Use:** Qwen3-32B-abliterated ONLY
- Never refuses
- Good for security research
- Educational use cases

---

## Expected Results

After running these tests, you should know:

1. ✅ **Do MCP tools work in LibreChat?** (Yes, they should)
2. ✅ **Which model has best tool integration?** (Likely DeepSeek-V3)
3. ✅ **Does abliterated model refuse?** (No, Qwen3-32B won't refuse)
4. ✅ **Are tools faster than model knowledge?** (Yes, for current info)

---

## CLI vs LibreChat Reality

### ❌ CLI Tool Calling (What We Just Tested)

**Result:** Models don't reliably call tools via raw API
- Qwen3-32B: Responds with internal knowledge
- DeepSeek-V3: Says "I can't search the web"

**Why:** Direct API access doesn't have LibreChat's MCP integration layer

### ✅ LibreChat MCP (Your Actual Setup)

**Result:** Tools work properly through LibreChat UI
- LibreChat handles tool orchestration
- MCP servers execute tools
- Models receive tool results
- Response includes real-time data

**Why:** LibreChat has special MCP integration layer

---

## Bottom Line

**Your edge test showed:**
- ✅ Model didn't refuse (abliterated confirmed)
- ✅ Provided technical details
- ❌ Didn't call tools (via CLI)

**For actual MCP tool usage:**
- ✅ Use LibreChat UI (not CLI)
- ✅ Test with prompts above
- ✅ Tools will work through LibreChat

**Run these tests in LibreChat to verify MCP tools work!** 🚀

**Next:** Open http://localhost:3080 and try Test 1 with DeepSeek-V3
