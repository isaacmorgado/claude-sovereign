## Chrome Extensions

### Extract Extension
```
I have a CRX file at [path]. Extract it to a folder so I can read the source code. CRX files are ZIP files with a header - you may need to strip the header or just rename to .zip and unzip.
```

### Analyze Extension
```
I extracted a Chrome extension to [folder path]. Read the manifest.json and explain:
1. What permissions does it request and why?
2. What does the background script do?
3. What content scripts are injected and on which sites?
4. Are there any privacy concerns?
```

### Find Extension ID
```
Help me find the extension ID for [extension name]. I need to locate its source files in ~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/Default/Extensions/
```

---

## Electron Apps

### Extract App
```
Find the Electron app bundle for [App Name] in /Applications, locate the app.asar file, and extract it to ~/Desktop/[app-name]-source so I can analyze it.
```

### Analyze Electron Source
```
I extracted an Electron app to [folder path]. Read the package.json and main entry files. Explain:
1. What is the app's architecture?
2. What are the main features based on the code structure?
3. What interesting patterns or techniques does it use?
```

### Find Main Entry
```
I extracted an Electron app to [path]. Find the main entry point from package.json and trace through the initialization code. What does this app do on startup?
```

---

## JavaScript Deobfuscation

### Beautify Code
```
I have a minified JavaScript file at [path]. Beautify it and make it readable. Add meaningful variable names where you can infer the purpose from context.
```

### Deep Analysis
```
Analyze this obfuscated JavaScript file at [path]. Focus on:
1. What does the code do? Trace the main execution flow.
2. Identify any API calls, URLs, or external communications
3. Find any interesting functions or logic patterns
4. Suggest better variable names based on usage
```

### Find Hidden Functionality
```
This JavaScript code appears obfuscated. Search for:
1. Hidden API endpoints or URLs
2. Encoded/encrypted strings that might be decoded at runtime
3. eval() or Function() calls that execute dynamic code
4. Any anti-debugging or detection code
```

### Reconstruct Logic
```
I have partially deobfuscated code at [path]. Help me understand this specific function: [function name or code block]. What is it doing step by step?
```

---

## macOS Apps

### Explore Bundle
```
I want to explore the macOS app at [path]. Show me its bundle structure, find any interesting resources, config files, or embedded assets. Look in Contents/Resources and Contents/Frameworks.
```

### Extract Resources
```
Extract all image assets, config files, and other resources from the macOS app at [path]. Organize them by type in ~/Desktop/[app-name]-resources/
```

### Analyze Info.plist
```
Read the Info.plist from [app path]. What permissions does this app request? What URL schemes does it handle? Any interesting configuration?
```

---

## Reverse Engineering Tools

### Setup Ghidra Analysis
```
Help me set up Ghidra to analyze [binary path]. I want to:
1. Import and auto-analyze the binary
2. Find the main function
3. Search for interesting strings (passwords, URLs, API keys)
4. Understand the overall program flow
```

### Frida Hook Script
```
Write a Frida script to hook [function/class] in [app name]. I want to:
1. Log all calls to this function with arguments
2. Optionally modify the return value
3. Print a stack trace to see who's calling it
```

### SSL Pinning Bypass
```
Help me bypass SSL pinning for [app name] so I can intercept its traffic. Suggest the best approach (Frida script, Objection, or manual patching) based on the app type.
```

---

## Terminal Scripts & Automation

### DNS Benchmark
```
Build a script that benchmarks DNS servers (Cloudflare 1.1.1.1, Google 8.8.8.8, Quad9 9.9.9.9, and my ISP's) from my location. Run multiple queries and report average response times.
```

### Network Diagnostics
```
Create a comprehensive network diagnostic script that checks:
1. Internet connectivity
2. DNS resolution
3. Default gateway
4. Current IP (local and public)
5. Active connections
6. Port scan for common services
```

### System Info Script
```
Build a system information script that collects:
1. Hardware specs (CPU, RAM, storage)
2. OS version and updates
3. Running processes and resource usage
4. Installed applications
5. Network configuration
Export to a readable report.
```

### File Automation
```
Create a script to [describe automation]. For example:
- Organize downloads by file type
- Rename files in bulk with pattern
- Find and remove duplicate files
- Sync folders with rsync
```

---

## Web Scraping

### Simple Scraper
```
Build a scraper for [website URL] that extracts [data description]. Handle pagination if needed and export to CSV/JSON.
```

### Authenticated Scraper
```
I need to scrape data from [website] but it requires login. Build a scraper using Playwright that:
1. Logs in with credentials from .env
2. Navigates to [target page]
3. Extracts [data fields]
4. Handles pagination
5. Exports to [format]
```

### Handle Dynamic Content
```
The website at [URL] loads content dynamically with JavaScript. Build a scraper that:
1. Waits for content to load
2. Scrolls to load infinite scroll content
3. Handles AJAX requests
4. Extracts the data I need: [fields]
```

### Anti-Detection Scraper
```
The website is blocking my scraper. Rebuild it with stealth measures:
- Random delays between requests (2-5 seconds)
- Rotate user agents from a realistic list
- Use puppeteer-stealth or undetected-chromedriver
- Respect robots.txt rate limits
- Add realistic mouse movements
```

## API Reverse Engineering

### Traffic Capture Setup
```
I want to understand how [app/website] communicates with its API. Help me set up mitmproxy to capture traffic, then analyze the requests and responses to document the API.
```

### Analyze Captured Traffic
```
I captured API traffic from [app]. The base URL is [url]. Analyze these requests and:
1. Document all endpoints discovered
2. Identify the authentication mechanism
3. Map request/response schemas
4. Note any rate limits or restrictions
```

### Build API Client
```
Based on my API research for [service], create a Python client that can:
1. Authenticate using [method]
2. Call the main endpoints I discovered
3. Handle rate limiting appropriately
4. Include error handling
```

### Decode Binary Protocol
```
I captured binary data from [source]. It might be protobuf or a custom format. Help me:
1. Try decoding with protoc --decode_raw
2. Identify the message structure
3. Create a .proto schema if possible
4. Build a decoder for this protocol
```

---

## Browser Automation

### Generic Automation
```
Build a Playwright automation that [describes workflow]. Include:
- Login handling if needed
- Screenshots at key steps for debugging
- Error handling with retries
- Logging of actions taken
```

### Login + Action
```
Automate: Login to [site] with credentials from .env, then [describe actions], finally [describe output/download].
```

### Monitoring Script
```
Build a monitoring script that:
1. Checks [URL/element] every [interval]
2. Extracts [data]
3. Compares to previous value
4. Alerts me if [condition]
5. Logs history to CSV
```

### Form Automation
```
Automate form submission at [URL]:
1. Fill fields: [list fields and values or source]
2. Handle any CAPTCHAs manually (pause and wait)
3. Submit and capture confirmation
4. Export results
```

### PDF/Report Download
```
Automate: Login to [site], navigate to [reports section], generate report for [date range], download PDF, save with naming pattern [pattern] to [folder].
```

## Troubleshooting Prompts

### General Debug
```
I'm trying to [goal] but getting [error/problem]. Here's what I've tried: [attempts]. What should I try next?
```

### Extension Issues
```
I extracted a Chrome extension but the folder is empty/missing key files. The extension ID is [id]. Help me find alternative ways to get the source code.
```

### Code Still Obfuscated
```
I ran the deobfuscator but the code is still hard to read. Here's a sample: [code block]. Can you help me understand what this specific part does?
```

### Scraper Blocked
```
My scraper to [site] is being blocked. I'm getting [error/response]. My current approach: [describe]. How can I bypass this?
```

### API Auth Failing
```
I'm trying to call [endpoint] but getting auth errors. The original app uses [observed auth method]. Help me replicate the authentication flow.
```
