# LOOKSMAXX

A facial metrics analysis and visualization system with Next.js frontend and MediaPipe-based facial landmark detection.

## Current Focus
Section: Landmark placement UX - new fixed orb pattern
Files: `src/components/LandmarkAnalysisTool.tsx`

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 14 (App Router)
- **Language**: TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: Framer Motion
- **Face Detection**: MediaPipe Tasks Vision (native WASM)
- **Icons**: Lucide React

## Organization Rules

- Pages/Routes → `src/app/`
- Components → `src/components/`
- Utilities → `src/lib/`
- Types → `src/types/` or co-located

## Code Quality

```bash
cd looksmaxx-app && npm run lint && npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Last Session (2025-12-19)

- **Redesigned landmark placement UX** to match original website pattern:
  - Fixed center glowing orb (stays in place, doesn't move with pan/zoom)
  - User drags/pans the image to align facial features with the orb
  - Click/Enter confirms placement at orb position
  - Arrow keys pan the image for fine adjustment
  - Auto-zoom (2.5x) centers each landmark under the orb when navigating
- Removed canvas-based rendering, now using React/CSS for orb and landmarks
- Landmarks show as colored dots that move with the image during pan
- Updated keyboard controls: arrows now pan image instead of moving landmark

## Next Steps

1. Test the new UX flow in browser
2. Verify auto-zoom centers landmarks correctly under the fixed orb
3. Fine-tune pan sensitivity and zoom levels
4. Self-host WASM files in `/public/wasm/` for better reliability
