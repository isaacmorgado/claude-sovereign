# KOMPLETE-KONTROL VSCode Extension

Forked VSCode AI coding assistant (from Roo-Code) with complete rebrand and unique extension IDs to avoid conflicts.

## Current Focus

Section: Extension Identity & Installation
Files: src/package.json, src/extension.ts, webview-ui/, installation scripts

## Last Session (2025-12-30)

- Fixed critical issue: Extension had same internal IDs as upstream Roo Code causing conflicts
- Replaced all 76+ `roo-cline` references with `komplete-kontrol` in package.json, source code, and webview
- Rebuilt extension with unique command/view/settings IDs
- Created diagnostic and installation scripts (DIAGNOSE_AND_FIX.sh, VERIFY_EXTENSION.sh)
- Generated fresh VSIX: bin/komplete-kontrol-3.38.1.vsix (33MB)
- Stopped at: User needs to install the fixed extension to see features and MCP servers

## Next Steps

1. User installs the fixed extension using ./DIAGNOSE_AND_FIX.sh
2. After installation, configure MCP servers in extension settings (needs API keys)
3. Verify all 18 MCP servers appear in settings UI
4. Test basic extension functionality (create task, run commands)
5. Document MCP server configuration requirements for each server
