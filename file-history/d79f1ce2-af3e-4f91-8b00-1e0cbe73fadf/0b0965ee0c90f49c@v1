# Manual Steps to Uninstall & Reinstall KOMPLETE-KONTROL

If the old extension is still showing, follow these steps carefully:

---

## Method 1: Automated Script (Recommended)

Run this script in Terminal:

```bash
cd /Users/imorgado/Projects/Roo-Code
./UNINSTALL_AND_REINSTALL.sh
```

Then **fully quit VSCode** (Cmd+Q) and reopen it.

---

## Method 2: Manual Uninstall via VSCode UI

### Step 1: Uninstall ALL Old Versions

1. **Open VSCode**

2. **Open Extensions panel** (`Cmd+Shift+X`)

3. **Search for each of these and uninstall:**
   - Type "roo" → Uninstall any found
   - Type "cline" → Uninstall any found
   - Type "komplete" → Uninstall any found
   - Type "claude" → Uninstall any found (if it's the old Roo Code)

4. **Verify they're gone:**
   - Search again to make sure nothing is left
   - Check the installed list

### Step 2: Clear VSCode Cache

**Open Terminal and run:**

```bash
# Clear extension caches
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/CachedExtensionVSIXs/*
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/CachedExtensions/*

# Optional: Clear all VSCode user data (this will reset ALL VSCode settings!)
# Only do this if nothing else works:
# rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/globalStorage/*
```

### Step 3: Completely Quit VSCode

**IMPORTANT: Don't just reload the window!**

1. Press `Cmd+Q` to fully quit VSCode
2. Wait 5 seconds
3. Check Activity Monitor to make sure no VSCode processes are running:
   - Open Activity Monitor (Spotlight → "Activity Monitor")
   - Search for "Code"
   - Force Quit any VSCode processes if found

### Step 4: Install New Extension

1. **Reopen VSCode**

2. **Open Extensions panel** (`Cmd+Shift+X`)

3. **Click the `...` menu** (three dots in the Extensions panel header)

4. **Select "Install from VSIX..."**

5. **Navigate to:**
   ```
   /Users/imorgado/Projects/Roo-Code/bin/komplete-kontrol-3.38.1.vsix
   ```

6. **Click "Install"**

7. **When prompted, click "Reload Required"**

### Step 5: Fully Restart VSCode Again

1. **Quit VSCode completely** (`Cmd+Q`)
2. **Reopen VSCode**
3. **Look for "KOMPLETE-KONTROL" in the Activity Bar** (left sidebar)

---

## Method 3: Command Line (If you have 'code' command)

### First, add 'code' command to PATH:

1. Open VSCode
2. Press `Cmd+Shift+P`
3. Type: "Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH"
4. Click it

### Then run these commands:

```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /Users/imorgado/Projects/Roo-Code

# Uninstall all possible old versions
code --uninstall-extension KompleteKontrol.komplete-kontrol --force
code --uninstall-extension rooveterinaryinc.roo-cline --force
code --uninstall-extension saoudrizwan.claude-dev --force

# Clear caches
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/CachedExtensionVSIXs/*
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/CachedExtensions/*

# Install new extension
code --install-extension bin/komplete-kontrol-3.38.1.vsix --force

echo "✅ Done! Now quit VSCode (Cmd+Q) and reopen it."
```

## 🔍 Troubleshooting: Still Not Appearing?

### Check 1: Is the extension installed?

**In VSCode:**
- Press `Cmd+Shift+X` to open Extensions
- Search for "KOMPLETE-KONTROL"
- It should appear in the installed list

**Via command line:**
```bash
code --list-extensions | grep -i komplete
```

Should show: `KompleteKontrol.komplete-kontrol` or similar

### Check 2: Check for errors

1. **Open Developer Tools:**
   - In VSCode: `Help` → `Toggle Developer Tools`
   - Click the `Console` tab

2. **Look for errors:**
   - Search for "komplete" or "error"
   - Look for extension activation errors

3. **Common errors and fixes:**
   - "Extension not found" → Extension didn't install properly, try again
   - "Activation failed" → Check Console for specific error
   - "Command not found" → Extension installed but not activated

### Check 3: Try showing it manually

1. **Press `Cmd+Shift+P`**
2. **Type:** "KOMPLETE-KONTROL"
3. **You should see commands like:**
   - KOMPLETE-KONTROL: New Task
   - KOMPLETE-KONTROL: Open Settings
   - View: Show KOMPLETE-KONTROL

4. **If you don't see any KOMPLETE-KONTROL commands:**
   - The extension isn't installed or activated
   - Go back to Step 1 and try again

### Check 4: View the Activity Bar

The Activity Bar is the vertical icon bar on the far left of VSCode.

**You should see:**
- A KOMPLETE-KONTROL icon (might look like the Roo icon but labeled "KOMPLETE-KONTROL")
- Click it to open the sidebar panel

**If you don't see it:**
- Right-click the Activity Bar
- Check if "KOMPLETE-KONTROL" appears in the menu
- Click it to show/hide

### Check 5: Verify the VSIX file

```bash
# Check the VSIX exists and is the right one
ls -lh /Users/imorgado/Projects/Roo-Code/bin/*.vsix

# Should show:
# komplete-kontrol-3.38.1.vsix  (about 33MB)
```

**If the file is missing or wrong size:**
```bash
cd /Users/imorgado/Projects/Roo-Code
pnpm run vsix
```

## 🆘 If Nothing Works

### Nuclear Option: Complete VSCode Reset

**⚠️ WARNING: This will delete ALL VSCode settings, extensions, and data!**

```bash
# Backup your settings first!
cp ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json ~/vscode-settings-backup.json

# Remove all VSCode data
rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/*
rm -rf ~/.vscode

# Restart VSCode (it will be like a fresh install)

# Reinstall KOMPLETE-KONTROL
code --install-extension /Users/imorgado/Projects/Roo-Code/bin/komplete-kontrol-3.38.1.vsix --force

# Restore your settings
cp ~/vscode-settings-backup.json ~/Library/Application\ Support/Code/User/settings.json
```

## ✅ Success Checklist

After following these steps, you should have:

- [ ] All old extensions uninstalled (nothing shows when searching "roo" or "cline")
- [ ] Cache cleared
- [ ] New VSIX installed
- [ ] VSCode fully restarted (quit and reopened, not just reloaded)
- [ ] "KOMPLETE-KONTROL" appears in Activity Bar
- [ ] Cmd+Shift+P shows KOMPLETE-KONTROL commands
- [ ] Extension panel opens when clicking the icon

## 📞 Still Having Issues?

If KOMPLETE-KONTROL still doesn't appear after following ALL these steps:

1. **Check the Developer Console** for specific errors
2. **Take a screenshot** of your Extensions panel showing what IS installed
3. **Run:** `code --list-extensions > ~/Desktop/my-extensions.txt` and check the file
4. **Verify VSCode version:** Should be 1.84.0 or higher
   - In VSCode: `Code` → `About Visual Studio Code`

The extension has been built correctly - if it's not appearing, it's an installation/activation issue that we can debug further.
