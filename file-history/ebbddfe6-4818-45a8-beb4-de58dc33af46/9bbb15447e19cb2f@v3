description: Collect research and documentation into buildguide.md

# Collect Command

Consolidate research, documentation, API specs, pricing info, or any gathered knowledge into `buildguide.md` - a persistent build guide that grows as you research and complete sections.

## Instructions

### 1. Identify What to Collect

Review the current conversation and identify:
- Research findings (pricing, API docs, specs, etc.)
- Technical decisions made
- Architecture insights discovered
- External documentation summaries
- Integration patterns or approaches discussed
- Any knowledge useful for building

If nothing obvious was researched, ask:
> What research or documentation would you like me to collect into buildguide.md?

### 2. Read or Create buildguide.md

Check for `buildguide.md` in the project root.

**If it exists:** Read it and understand current structure and sections.

**If it doesn't exist:** Create it with this structure:

```markdown
# Build Guide

> Project: [Project Name]
> Created: [date]
> Last Updated: [date]

## Overview
[One paragraph describing what we're building]

## Sections
- [ ] [Section 1 name]
- [ ] [Section 2 name]
- [ ] [Section 3 name]

---

## Research & Documentation

[Collected knowledge goes here]

---

## Completed Sections

[Sections marked complete by /checkpoint go here]
```

### 3. Ask Integration Questions

Before adding content, ask the user:

1. **"What section does this research belong to?"**
   - Existing section from the Sections list
   - New section (will be added to the list)
   - General reference (goes under Research & Documentation)

2. **"What detail level?"**
   - Full (all details preserved)
   - Summary (key points + quick reference)
   - Minimal (just essentials for implementation)

3. **"Any implementation notes to include?"**

### 4. Format the Collected Knowledge

Structure based on content type:

**For API/Service Research:**
```markdown
### [Service Name]

> Source: [URL or description] | Collected: [date]

**Key Points:**
- [Point 1]
- [Point 2]

**Quick Reference:**
| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| Endpoint | `https://...` |
| Auth | Bearer token |

**Implementation Notes:**
- [Note 1]
```

**For Pricing/Plans Research:**
```markdown
### [Service] Pricing

> Source: [URL] | Collected: [date]

**Selected Plan:** [Plan name] - $X/mo

**Key Limits:**
- [Limit 1]
- [Limit 2]

**Cost Calculation:**
[If applicable]
```

**For Architecture/Patterns:**
```markdown
### [Pattern Name]

**Why:** [Reason for this approach]

**How:**
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]

**Files Affected:**
- `path/to/file.ts`
```

### 5. Update buildguide.md

**Placement Rules:**
- Section-specific research → Under that section header
- General research → Under `## Research & Documentation`
- New sections → Add to Sections checklist AND create header

**Update the metadata:**
- Change `Last Updated: [today's date]`

### 6. Show Summary

After updating, display:
```
Updated buildguide.md:
- Added: [what was added]
- Section: [which section]
- Next: [suggested next step or section to research]
```

## Integration with /checkpoint

When `/checkpoint` is run after completing work:
1. The relevant section in buildguide.md gets marked `[x]` complete
2. Content moves to `## Completed Sections` with completion date
3. Next uncompleted section is highlighted

This creates a living document that tracks both research AND progress.

## Example Workflow

```
Session 1:
> Research Stripe integration
> /collect
→ Adds Stripe research to buildguide.md under "Payments" section

Session 2:
> Implement Stripe integration
> /checkpoint
→ Marks "Payments" section complete, moves to Completed Sections
→ Shows "Authentication" as next section

Session 3:
> Research Auth0 vs Clerk
> /collect
→ Adds auth research to "Authentication" section
```

## Example buildguide.md

```markdown
# Build Guide

> Project: SaaS Starter
> Created: 2024-01-10
> Last Updated: 2024-01-15

## Overview
A SaaS starter kit with auth, payments, and dashboard.

## Sections
- [x] Payments
- [ ] Authentication
- [ ] Dashboard
- [ ] Deployment

---

## Research & Documentation

### Authentication

> Source: Auth0 docs, Clerk docs | Collected: 2024-01-15

**Decision:** Using Clerk

**Why:**
- Better DX
- Built-in components
- $25/mo for 5k MAU

**Quick Reference:**
- Dashboard: https://dashboard.clerk.com
- Docs: https://clerk.com/docs

**Implementation Notes:**
- Use `@clerk/nextjs` middleware
- Wrap app in `<ClerkProvider>`

---

## Completed Sections

### Payments (Completed: 2024-01-12)

**Implementation:** Stripe Checkout + Webhooks

**Key Files:**
- `app/api/stripe/route.ts`
- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`
- `lib/stripe.ts`

**Notes:**
- Using price IDs from dashboard
- Webhook secret in STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET
```

## Guidelines

- **buildguide.md is the single source** - All research goes here
- **Sections = milestones** - Each represents a completable chunk of work
- **Research before implement** - Collect knowledge, then build
- **Checkpoint marks progress** - Moves sections to "Completed" as you finish
- **Keep it actionable** - Focus on what's needed to build, not exhaustive docs
