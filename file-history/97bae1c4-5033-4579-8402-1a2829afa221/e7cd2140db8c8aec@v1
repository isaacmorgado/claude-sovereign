# Face Generation for Facial Landmark Analysis

## Files Created

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `prompts.json` | 28 prompts for all ethnicity/gender/view combinations |
| `generate_faces.py` | Playwright automation script for Somake AI |
| `generate_faces_simple.py` | Simple clipboard helper (manual generation) |
| `generated_photos_api.py` | Generated.photos API script (front views only) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |

## Quick Start

### Option 1: Semi-Automated (Recommended)
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install pyperclip

# Run the simple script
python generate_faces_simple.py
```
This opens Somake AI and copies prompts to your clipboard one by one.

### Option 2: Fully Automated with Playwright
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install playwright aiohttp
playwright install chromium

# Run automation
python generate_faces.py
```

### Option 3: Generated.photos API (Front views only)
```bash
# Get API key from https://generated.photos/account#apikey
# Edit generated_photos_api.py and add your API key
python generated_photos_api.py
```

## Notes

- Consider using stock photos for side profiles if AI results aren't good
- Somake AI has commercial-use license for generated images
- Generated.photos requires paid plan for HD images
