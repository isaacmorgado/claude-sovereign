# Plan: Add Vocal Isolation Feature to SPLICE Concept Documentation

## Summary
Update the SPLICE `Concept_Clarification.md` document to include the new Vocal Isolation feature that uses Demucs to isolate dialogue from noisy audio (loud music, wind, low voice levels) before transcription and take analysis.

## User Requirements
- **Trigger**: User toggle ("Noisy Audio Mode")
- **Provider**: Demucs (open-source, self-hostable)
- **Audio Output Options**: User can choose:
  - Both tracks (original + isolated as separate layers)
  - Replace original with isolated
  - Original only (use isolated just for analysis)
- **Tier**: Available in Creator ($34.99) and Pro ($69.99) tiers only

## Files to Modify

| File | Action |
|------|--------|
| `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/Concept_Clarification.md` | Update with vocal isolation feature |

## Changes to Make

### 1. Add New Section: "Vocal Isolation Feature"
Insert after "Key Differentiator" section:

- Feature overview and purpose
- When to use (loud music, wind, low voice)
- User toggle mechanism
- Audio output options (analysis only, replace, both tracks)
- Processing time impact (~40s per minute of audio)

### 2. Update Technical Architecture Diagram
Add Demucs processing step to the pipeline:
```
Audio → [Demucs GPU Workers] → Whisper → GPT-4o-mini → Results
```

### 3. Update Feature Breakdown
Add to "Core AI Pipeline (Cloud)" section:
- Demucs vocal isolation (htdemucs model)
- Self-hosted GPU worker cluster (T4/A10)
- Audio output handling (download, import, timeline placement)

### 4. Update Pricing Tiers Table
- Basic: Vocal Isolation = ✗
- Creator: Vocal Isolation = ✓
- Pro: Vocal Isolation = ✓ (with priority processing)

### 5. Update Core User Flow
Add step between "Upload & Process" and "Results Appear":
```
3a. VOCAL ISOLATION (if enabled)
    - Audio processed through Demucs
    - Vocals separated from background
    - Progress: "Isolating vocals..."
```

### 6. Add Infrastructure Cost Section
- GPU worker costs (~$2,500-3,500/month at scale)
- Per-minute processing cost (~$0.007)
- Break-even analysis showing feature is margin-positive

### 7. Update UI/UX Section
Add vocal isolation UI mockup showing:
- Toggle checkbox with tier badge
- Output mode radio buttons
- Processing time warning

### 8. Update Open Items Checklist
Add:
- [ ] Set up Demucs GPU worker infrastructure
- [ ] Design vocal isolation UI components
- [ ] Implement audio download and import logic

## Implementation Order
1. Add Vocal Isolation Feature section (new content)
2. Update Technical Architecture diagram
3. Update Feature Breakdown section
4. Update Pricing Tiers table
5. Update Core User Flow diagram
6. Add Cost Analysis section
7. Update Open Items

## Validation
- Ensure all three output modes are clearly documented
- Verify tier gating is consistent (Creator+ only)
- Confirm processing time estimates are included
- Check that Demucs is specified as the provider (not Eleven Labs)
