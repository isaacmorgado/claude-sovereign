# SPLICE - Concept Clarification

## Product Overview

### One-Sentence Description

A Premiere Pro UXP plugin that uses AI transcription to automatically detect, label, and organize multiple takes by what's being said ("Take 1 - Hey Guys"), color-codes them on the timeline, removes silences intelligently, and helps editors instantly see and select the best version of each line.

---

## Target User

### Primary
YouTube creators, podcasters, and talking-head video editors who spend hours manually cutting dead air and selecting between multiple takes.

### Secondary
- Corporate video editors handling interview footage
- Online course creators editing lecture content
- Documentary editors managing large amounts of B-roll and interviews
- Social media content teams with high-volume output

### Common Traits
They edit dialogue-heavy content, work under time pressure, and repeat the same mechanical editing tasks daily.

---

## Key Differentiator

Existing tools (AutoPod, Timebolt) treat silence removal as a **waveform problem** — they look at audio levels.

SPLICE treats it as a **content problem** — it understands *what's being said* to:

| Traditional Tools | SPLICE |
|-------------------|--------|
| "There's silence here, cut it" | "This is Take 3 of 'Hey guys welcome back'" |
| Flat timeline of clips | Organized groups by line/sentence |
| Editor manually finds best take | Takes labeled and compared side-by-side |
| Dumb cuts based on dB | Smart cuts based on sentence boundaries |

### The "Aha Moment"
Editor imports 20 minutes of raw footage, clicks analyze, and suddenly their timeline shows:

```
[Green] Take 1 - "Hey guys welcome back to the channel"
[Green] Take 2 - "Hey guys welcome back to the channel"
[Green] Take 3 - "Hey guys welcome back to the channel" ★ Best
[Blue]  Take 1 - "Today we're going to talk about..."
[Blue]  Take 2 - "Today we're going to talk about..." ★ Best
[Yellow] Take 1 - "First thing you need to know..."
...
```

## Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| Plugin Framework | UXP | Adobe's modern framework, future-proof |
| Business Model | Freemium | Lower barrier to entry, upsell power users |
| AI Processing | Cloud | Offload compute, easier updates, usage tracking |
| Transcription | Whisper | Most affordable & effective for scale |
| LLM | GPT-4o-mini | Cost-effective for take analysis |

## Feature Breakdown

### Core AI Pipeline (Cloud)
- Audio extraction and upload
- Speech-to-text transcription (Whisper)
- LLM analysis (GPT-4o-mini) to:
  - Identify repeated phrases/sentences (takes)
  - Group takes by semantic similarity
  - Detect false starts vs. complete takes
  - Score take quality (clarity, energy, completeness)
  - Identify filler words and stumbles
- Return structured data to plugin

### Timeline Intelligence
- Auto-label clips: "Take N - [first few words]"
- Color-code by take group (all versions of same line = same color)
- Star/flag suggested "best take" per group
- Nest take groups into sequences or bins
- Visual markers showing take boundaries

### Silence & Cut Management
- Cut at sentence boundaries, not arbitrary silence points
- Preserve natural breath pauses
- Remove incomplete takes / false starts automatically
- Smart padding based on speech rhythm

### Editor Controls
- Accept/reject AI suggestions per take
- Override best-take selection
- Adjust grouping (merge/split take groups)
- Preview any take with spacebar
- One-click "keep best, delete rest"

### Export & Workflow
- Generate script from timeline (what was actually said)
- Export take notes for director review
- Sync decisions across team (paid)
