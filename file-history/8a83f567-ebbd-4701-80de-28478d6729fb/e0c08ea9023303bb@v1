# Humanify - AI-Powered Variable Renaming

## When to Use
- **After deobfuscation**, when code is readable but variables are meaningless (a, b, c, _0x123)
- When you need to **understand the logic** but variable names like `t`, `e`, `n` make it impossible
- For **deep reverse engineering** where you need to trace data flow
- When webcrack/wakaru output is still hard to understand

## Installation
Already installed in this folder.

## Requirements
Needs an LLM API key (one of these):
- OpenAI API key (`OPENAI_API_KEY`)
- Local LLM (Ollama)
- Other supported providers

## Common Commands

### With OpenAI
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-key"
npx humanify input.js -o output.js
```

### With local Ollama
```bash
npx humanify input.js -o output.js --local
```

## Best For
- Making deobfuscated code actually understandable
- Renaming `function a(b,c,d)` to `function fetchUserData(userId, options, callback)`
- Final step after using webcrack/wakaru
