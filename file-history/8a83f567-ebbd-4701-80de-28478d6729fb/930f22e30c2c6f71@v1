# FaceIQ Data Capture Scripts

## How to Use These Scripts

### Step 1: Open FaceIQ in Chrome
Go to https://beta.faceiqlabs.com and log in

### Step 2: Open DevTools
Press `Cmd + Option + I` (Mac) or `F12` (Windows)

### Step 3: Paste the Capture Script
Go to the **Console** tab and paste the contents of `capture-all.js`

### Step 4: Use the Site Normally
- Upload a front face photo
- Adjust landmarks if needed
- Upload a side profile
- View results

### Step 5: Export Captured Data
In the console, run:
```javascript
FaceIQCapture.export()
```

This will download a JSON file with all captured data.

## What Gets Captured

| Data | Source | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| MediaPipe landmarks | Client-side | 478 facial points from front face |
| API responses | Network | All /api/* calls and responses |
| React state | DOM | Component state if accessible |
| User adjustments | Events | Any manual landmark adjustments |
| Calculation results | DOM | Scraped from results UI |

---

## Troubleshooting

### "FaceLandmarker is not defined"
The MediaPipe library loads dynamically. Wait until you see the face detection UI, then the intercept will work.

### Script doesn't capture landmarks
Make sure you paste the script BEFORE uploading a photo. The intercept needs to be in place first.

### Data looks incomplete
Run `FaceIQCapture.status()` to see what has been captured so far.
