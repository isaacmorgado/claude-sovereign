# Wakaru - JavaScript Unminifier

## When to Use
- **Unpacking bundled JavaScript** (webpack, browserify, rollup bundles)
- **Reconstructing module structure** from a single bundled file
- **Understanding app architecture** by seeing original file boundaries
- When you have a large bundle and want to split it into readable modules

## Installation
Already installed in this folder. Run from here:
```bash
npx wakaru <input.js> -o ./output
```

## Common Commands

### Unpack a bundle into separate modules

```

### Unminify a single file

```

## Best For
- Webpack bundles
- Browserify bundles
- Large single-file apps that were originally multiple modules
- Seeing import/export relationships
