**Your brain doesn't run on motivation—it runs on constraint.**

Your environment either pushes you toward output or bleeds dopamine into distractions.

**The Principle:**
Productivity isn't mindset—it's architecture. If your room offers constant stimulation, your brain won't give you intensity—it doesn't need to.

**When you change the room, your brain changes with it.**

This is how you turn focus into the default output, not something you fight yourself to do.`,

      content: `Make the productive path the easy path.

**Setup:**
- Your workspace is clean
- No novelty objects in sight
- Only tools required to do the task
- Water bottle on desk (prevents getting up to refill)

**The Goal:**
When you sit down, there's nothing to do except work.

**Examples:**
- Gym bag packed the night before
- Meal prep done so healthy eating is easy
- Work tools open before you sit down
- Phone charging in another room

**The Principle:**
Friction kills action. Remove friction from productive behaviors and you'll do them automatically.`,

      content: `Make distraction harder than focus.

**Setup:**
- Phone sits in another room
- Notifications OFF
- No food nearby (eating is dopamine escape behavior)
- Social media logged out on browser

**The Goal:**
Distractions require effort to access.

**Examples:**
- Delete social media apps (use browser only)
- Website blockers during work hours
- Phone in drawer, not pocket
- TV unplugged or in another room

**The Principle:**
You're not trying to have infinite willpower. You're trying to make distraction require more effort than work.`,

      title: '3. Single-Context Rooms',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**You don't relax where you work, and you don't work where you relax.**

**The Problem:**
When your bed is also your couch, desk, and entertainment center, your brain never knows what mode to be in.

**The Fix:**
- Bedroom = sleep only
- Desk = work only
- Couch = relaxation only

**If You Have Limited Space:**
- At minimum: different desk positions for work vs. play
- Different lighting for different activities
- Physical cues that signal "work mode" vs "relax mode"

**The Science:**
Your brain associates environments with behaviors. When you work in bed, you condition yourself to be unfocused in bed AND sleepy at your desk.

**Create Clear Boundaries:**
The more distinct your contexts, the more automatic your state changes become.`,

      content: `**This Week: Audit Your Space**

**Workspace Check:**
- [ ] Is phone in another room?
- [ ] Are notifications off?
- [ ] Is there food at arm's reach? (remove it)
- [ ] Are distracting objects visible? (remove them)
- [ ] Is water accessible? (add it)

**Bedroom Check:**
- [ ] Is there a TV in the room? (consider removing)
- [ ] Is phone charging outside the room?
- [ ] Is it dark enough for sleep?

**Phone Check:**
- [ ] Social media apps deleted? (use browser)
- [ ] Notifications off for non-essential apps?
- [ ] Screen time limits set?

**The Philosophy:**
You're not fighting yourself. You're engineering your environment so the right behaviors require no effort and the wrong behaviors require maximum effort.

**The Result:**
Focus becomes the default. Distraction becomes work. Your brain adapts to the path of least resistance—make sure that path leads somewhere useful.`,
