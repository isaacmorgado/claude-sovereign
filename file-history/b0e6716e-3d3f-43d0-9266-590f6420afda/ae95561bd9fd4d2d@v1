      content: `Nutrition doesn't have to be complicated. 90% of results come from these fundamentals:

1. **Calories** determine weight change (surplus = gain, deficit = lose)
2. **Protein** protects/builds muscle
3. **Everything else** is optimization

**The Hierarchy:**
1. Total calories (most important)
2. Protein intake
3. Food quality
4. Meal timing (least important)

Get the top two right and you'll get 80% of the results. The rest is fine-tuning.`,

      content: `**The Math:**
- Maintenance = your bodyweight × 14-16 (depends on activity)
- Fat loss = maintenance - 300 to 500 calories
- Muscle gain = maintenance + 200 to 300 calories

**Finding Your Maintenance:**
1. Track food for 1 week at current intake
2. Track weight daily
3. If weight stable = that's maintenance
4. If gaining = you're above maintenance
5. If losing = you're below maintenance

**Why Counting Works:**
Most people dramatically underestimate calories eaten and overestimate calories burned. Tracking eliminates the guesswork.

**Why Counting Isn't Forever:**
Once you learn portion sizes and develop habits, you can transition to intuitive eating. But learn the fundamentals first.`,

      title: 'Protein: The Priority',

      content: `**Target: 0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight**

This is the most important macro for body composition.

**Why Protein Matters:**
- Builds and maintains muscle
- Most satiating macro (keeps you full)
- Highest thermic effect (burns calories during digestion)
- Protects muscle during fat loss

**Hitting It Daily:**
- Each meal should have a protein source
- 30-50g per meal, 3-4 meals
- Fill gaps with protein shakes if needed
- Front-load protein earlier in day for satiety

**Best Sources:**
- Chicken, turkey, lean beef
- Fish, eggs
- Greek yogurt, cottage cheese
- Protein powder (supplement, not replacement)`,

      title: 'Carbs & Fats',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `After protein, fill remaining calories with carbs and fats based on preference.

**Minimum Fat:** 0.3-0.4g per pound bodyweight
Fat is essential for hormones. Don't go below this.

**Carbs:** Whatever's left after protein and fat
Carbs fuel training and fill out muscles. Not the enemy.

**Practical Split:**
| Goal | Protein | Fat | Carbs |
|------|---------|-----|-------|
| Fat Loss | 1g/lb | 0.3-0.4g/lb | Fill remaining |
| Maintenance | 0.8-1g/lb | 0.4g/lb | Fill remaining |
| Muscle Gain | 1g/lb | 0.4g/lb | Higher carbs |

**The Reality:**
As long as protein and calories are right, the carb/fat ratio is personal preference. Some people feel better with more carbs, others with more fats.`,

      title: 'Food Quality',
      humorLevel: 'medium',
      content: `**80% whole foods, 20% whatever**

You don't need to be perfect. You need to be consistent.

**Prioritize:**
- Protein from animal sources
- Vegetables with most meals
- Fruits, whole grains, legumes
- Healthy fats (olive oil, avocado, nuts)

**Minimize:**
- Processed foods (chips, cookies, fast food)
- Seed oils (vegetable oil, canola)
- Added sugars
- Ultra-processed snacks

**Why Quality Matters:**
- Better nutrient density
- Better satiety (stay fuller longer)
- Better hormone function
- Less inflammation

**But Also:**
A 90% clean diet with occasional treats is more sustainable than 100% clean with weekly binges.`,

      content: `**Step 1: Calculate Your Numbers**
- Maintenance: bodyweight × 15
- Protein: bodyweight × 1g
- Fat: bodyweight × 0.4g
- Carbs: remaining calories ÷ 4

**Step 2: Track for 2 Weeks**
Use MyFitnessPal or similar. Don't change anything yet—just observe.

**Step 3: Adjust Based on Goals**
- Want to lose fat? Subtract 300-500 cal from maintenance
- Want to gain muscle? Add 200-300 cal to maintenance
- Protein stays the same either way

**Step 4: Evaluate Weekly**
- Weigh daily, average weekly
- Losing 0.5-1lb/week? Good cut
- Gaining 0.25-0.5lb/week? Good bulk
- Adjust calories as needed

**The Mindset:**
This isn't a diet—it's learning how food works. Once you understand the fundamentals, you can navigate any situation.`,
