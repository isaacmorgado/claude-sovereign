# SPLICE

AI-powered Premiere Pro UXP plugin for detecting takes, removing silences, and accelerating video editing workflows.

## Current Focus
**95% FIRECUT Parity** - All core features implemented

## Quick Reference

### Pricing Tiers
| Tier | Price | Hours | Isolation | Stripe Price ID |
|------|-------|-------|-----------|-----------------|
| Starter | $19/mo | 15 hrs | ❌ None | price_1SgH4m2L5BseYEbCih347qfr |
| Pro | $49/mo | 50 hrs | 45 min included | price_1SgH4o2L5BseYEbCIoR19lhQ |
| Team | $149/mo | 150 hrs | 3 hrs included | price_1SgH4q2L5BseYEbCYTlimb5M |
| Overage | $1/hr | - | $0.10/min | price_1SgH4y2L5BseYEbClZuxNRu8 |

### Isolation Pricing (v3.4)
- **Starter**: No access (upgrade required)
- **Pro**: 45 min included, then $0.10/min overage
- **Team**: 3 hrs included, then $0.10/min overage
- **Our cost**: $0.015/min → **85% margin on overage**
- **Worst-case margin**: 80%+ (sized to maintain margins at full utilization)

### Key Constraints
- UXP requires Premiere Pro 25.6+
- Use `127.0.0.1` not `localhost` in fetch URLs
- Backend (prod): https://splice-api-production.up.railway.app

## Implementation Phases

- Phase 1: Backend billing ✅
- Phase 2: Frontend credits ✅
- Phase 3: Preview Mode ✅
- Phase 4: v3.5 Direct DOM Reconstruction ✅

## v3.5 Architecture (Implemented)

**Zero-manual-step workflow using UXP DOM APIs:**

1. Detect silences/takes (existing workflow)
2. Backend generates JSON cut list via `/cut-list` endpoint
3. Plugin builds sequence directly using `builder.js`
4. New sequence created with `_SPLICE` suffix

**Core UXP APIs:**
- `SequenceEditor.createInsertProjectItemAction()` - Insert clips at timecode
- `ProjectItem.createSetColorLabelAction(index)` - Color clips (set BEFORE insert)
- `TrackItem.createSetInPointAction/OutPointAction()` - Set in/out points
- `project.executeTransaction(actions)` - Batch execute atomically
- `fs.createPersistentToken(folder)` - Silent file access

**New Endpoints:**
- `POST /cut-list` - Generate JSON cut list from silences/takes
- `POST /cut-list/takes` - Generate cut list keeping only takes

**Key Functions:**
- `buildSequenceFromCutList(cutList)` - Build sequence from backend cut list
- `buildSequenceFromDetection(silences, takes, source)` - Direct build from detection
- `setupMediaFolder()` - Set up persistent token for media access
- `generateCutList(options)` - Backend cut list generation

**Legacy (Deprecated):**
- `splice-plugin/js/slice9-razor.js` - Old XML workflow (still available)
- `splice-backend/services/xmlProcessor.js` - Old XML processor

## Last Session (2025-12-21)

Fixed critical UXP API issues in v3.5 builder and prepared for testing.

**What was done:**
- Fixed 5 API issues: SequenceFactory → createCloneAction(), TickTime objects, action creation in transactions
- Created comprehensive testing guide (TESTING_V3.5.md)
- Started backend server (running on https://127.0.0.1:3847)

**Files modified:**
- `splice-plugin/js/builder.js` - Fixed all UXP API calls (builder.js:146-408)
- `splice-plugin/manifest.json` - Version 3.5.0
- `TESTING_V3.5.md` - Created testing guide

**Stopped at:** Backend running, ready to test in Premiere Pro 25.6+. Need to load plugin and test buildSequenceV35() via UXP console.

## Next Steps

1. Load plugin in Premiere Pro 25.6+ and test v3.5 builder
2. Add "Build New Sequence" button to UI
3. Wire detection workflow to auto-trigger builder
