[Intro]
Yeah, uh
She thought she had the last word
Thought she wrote my ending
But I'm just beginning, yeah
Watch this

[Verse 1]
She cursed my name in circles, drew pentagrams in sand (damn)
Thought voodoo dolls could stop a god, she don't understand (nah)
I rose from every hex she threw, phoenix from the flame (up)
While she was plotting my demise, I was plotting game (chess)

See, she wanted me to fall, prayed I'd stumble in the dark (she prayed)
But I got allies worldwide, got embassies in every park (global)
From Paris to Jakarta, got familia on speed dial (ring ring)
She threw stones at a fortress, I just watched her ass and smiled (smiled)

Money coming in rotations, Earth around the sun (spin)
She thought she blocked my blessings, but I got a hundred funds (run)
Multiple streams, multiple teams, I'm the delta where they meet (flow)
She's still in the same spot, I'm moving at light speed (gone)

[Chorus]
You thought you won, that's hilarious (ha)
I'm so far ahead, it's various (planes)
Time zones can't capture where I'm at (worldwide)
You gon' die in my shadow, that's a fact (eclipse)

Last laugh echoes through the atmosphere (ha ha)
I'm stratospheric, you stuck in first gear (zoom)
Money so long it got longitude (latitude)
Your curse expired, check the attitude (expired)

[Verse 2]
She whispered to her circle, "Watch him crash and burn" (burn)
But I turned every L into lessons that I learned (scholar)
PhD in comebacks, master's in the rise (degrees)
While she was spreading rumors, I was touching foreign skies (passport)

Got connects in every continent, they call me Mr. World (globe)
She was casting spells with candles, I was making power moves unfurled (chess)
Checkmate in seven languages, I'm fluent in this win (multilingual)
She thought she was the author, but I ghost-wrote her end (pen)

Now I'm counting commas, she still counting all my flaws (counting)
I'm too busy building empires to acknowledge her applause (building)
She wanted me in shadows, but I AM the shadow now (eclipse)
So tall she can't see sun, she just sees my silhouette somehow (tall)

[Bridge]
(Double entendre section - Kendrick-style)

She tried to bury me, didn't know I'm a SEED (plant/legacy)
Six feet under turned to roots that spread globally (underground network)
Die in my shadow? That's a SHADE of irony (shade/literal shadow)
She threw SHADE first, now she living shady (see)

I CAST a shadow, like I CAST her out (cast=throw/shadow cast)
She CAST a curse, but I'm the CASTING SCOUT (finding stars)
Now I'm screening talents worldwide, that's a CAST (movie)
While she's type-CAST as bitter, stuck in the past (acting term)

[Verse 3]
Allies on every coast, got a network Fibonacci (exponential)
Each one brings ten more, it's compounding, not a hobby (growth)
She isolated me, but isolation breeds focus (zoom)
Now I'm everywhere at once, that's that quantum locus (science)

Money printing different currencies, I'm global tender (worldwide)
She's still shopping local, I'm a continental spender (levels)
Private jets to board meetings in Dubai by noon (time zones)
While she's still in that small town, howling at my moon (stuck)

See, her curse was actually FUEL for my ascension (gas/motivation)
Every hex became a step, every spell a new dimension (up)
She wanted me six feet deep, now I'm six figures high (elevation)
Six figures turned to seven, eight coming, multiply (mathematics)

[Chorus]
You thought you won, that's hilarious (ha)
I'm so far ahead, it's various (planes)
Time zones can't capture where I'm at (worldwide)
You gon' die in my shadow, that's a fact (eclipse)

Last laugh echoes through the atmosphere (ha ha)
I'm stratospheric, you stuck in first gear (zoom)
Money so long it got longitude (latitude)
Your curse expired, check the attitude (expired)

[Verse 4]
She tried to dim my light, but didn't know I'm SOLAR (sun)
Renewable energy, I keep getting colder (hot/cold - paradox)
No, I mean COLDER, like my jewelry frozen (ice)
But I'm HOT commodity, see how I've chosen? (word play)

To flip her negative to POSITIVE cash flows (math/energy)
She subtracted blessings, I just ADDED zeros (numbers)
Multiplication of my assets, division of her peace (math operations)
While she calculated my downfall, I calculated my increase (calculator)

Got allies in high places, low places, every floor (vertical)
Basement to penthouse, I got keys to every door (levels)
She thought she locked me out of heaven, but I built my own (architect)
Skyscraper status, she can't reach me on the phone (tall/unreachable)

[Outro]
So here's to every curse that she thought would make me small (cheers)
They were actually GROWTH curses, made me ten feet tall (giant)
She'll die in my shadow, not physically, you see (metaphor)
But her memory of me will ECLIPSE her destiny (overshadow)

'Cause when she tells her story, she'll start with "there was him" (me)
And every chapter after just shows how she couldn't win (loss)
The last laugh is MINE, echoing through TIME (forever)
While she's stuck in that moment, I'm in my PRIME (now)

[Final Bar]
She cursed the ground I walk on, but I LEVITATED (float)
Now every step I take is ELEVATED (up)
She's watching from below as I INNOVATE it (create)
Last laugh so loud, it REVERBERATED (echo)

THEMATIC ANALYSIS:
- Heavy use of mathematical metaphors (addition, multiplication, exponential growth)
- Global imagery (time zones, continents, languages)
- Scientific references (quantum, solar, Fibonacci)
- Shadow/light duality throughout
- Every "curse" becomes a "blessing" (alchemy theme)
- Vertical imagery (elevation, levels, six feet under vs. six figures high)
