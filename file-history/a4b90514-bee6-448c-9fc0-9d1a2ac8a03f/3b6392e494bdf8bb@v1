## 🎯 The Big Change

### ❌ Old Way (v1):
```
Files scattered across 4 folders:
- Audio/MP3/song.mp3
- Metadata/song.info.json
- Transcripts/song.srt
- Thumbnails/song.jpg
```

### ✅ New Way (v2):
```
Everything together in ONE folder:
Music/2026-01-13 - Song Name/
├── song.mp3
├── song.info.json
├── song.srt
└── song.jpg
```

**Result**: Easier to find, backup, share, and organize!
