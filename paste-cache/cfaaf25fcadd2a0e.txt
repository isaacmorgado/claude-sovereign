Continue work on Komplete Kontrol CLI at /Users/imorgado/Desktop/Projects/komplete-kontrol-cli.

  What's Done: TypeScript foundation complete - SPARC, ReAct+Reflexion, LLM-as-Judge, Constitutional AI, Tree of Thoughts implemented (core structures only, need LLM integration)

  Current State: Core architectural patterns established. Build system works (81.1 KB, 0 errors). Ready to implement autonomy features.

  Next Step: Implement Bounded Autonomy safety system at src/core/safety/bounded-autonomy/index.ts

  Key Files:
  - src/core/safety/constitutional/index.ts (reference for safety patterns)
  - plans/ULTIMATE-TOOL-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md (Phase 2.5 spec, lines 515-538)
  - TYPESCRIPT-MIGRATION-STATUS.md (detailed progress tracker)

  Key Context: All features need LLM integration layer. Bounded Autonomy defines prohibited actions (force push, bypass security, expose secrets, delete prod data, deploy prod). Implements escalation system for user approval.

  Approach: Implement Bounded Autonomy following Constitutional AI pattern. Define prohibited actions list, check before each action, escalate if needed. Keep structure similar to existing core modules.
