Continuation Prompt

  Continue work on Komplete Kontrol CLI at /Users/imorgado/Desktop/Projects/komplete-kontrol-cli.

  What's Done:
  - ActionExecutor implementation complete (6 action types: file I/O, bash, LLM gen)
  - /auto command functional for simple tasks (1-10 iterations)

  Current State: Autonomous mode works but lacks state awareness - may recreate existing files

  Next Step: Add file existence checks to ActionExecutor before file_write operations

  Key Files:
  - src/core/agents/ActionExecutor.ts (executeFileWrite method, line 95)
  - src/core/agents/reflexion/index.ts (act method, line 89)
  - QUICKSTART-AUTO-MODE.md (usage examples)

  Key Context:
  - Test showed hello.ts created successfully in 3 iterations
  - Agent doesn't check if files exist before creating (known limitation)
  - All 28 test files committed in 9d5e0c4

  Approach: Read ActionExecutor.ts executeFileWrite method. Add existence check before fs.writeFile. Test with /auto on existing file.
