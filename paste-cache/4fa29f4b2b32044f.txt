Network & API Interception
mitmproxy: A command-line proxy used to intercept HTTPS traffic, analyze server-side calculations (like in FaceIQ Labs), and script automated modifications to API flows.

Burp Suite Professional: The industry-standard GUI proxy used for deep manual inspection of web requests, offering advanced "Repeater" and "Intruder" tools for manipulating traffic.

Turbo Intruder: A Burp Suite extension used to send massive volumes of HTTP requests rapidly to test for race conditions (e.g., in Tinder swipes).

Charles Proxy: A web debugging proxy often preferred for inspecting iOS and Android mobile traffic due to its user-friendly handling of SSL certificates.

Caido: A lightweight, Rust-based alternative to Burp Suite designed for speed and efficiency in intercepting web traffic.

Wireshark: A network protocol analyzer used for deep packet-level inspection (TCP/UDP) when you need to see traffic below the HTTP layer.

JA3 Transport Inspector: A tool used to identify your TLS/SSL "fingerprint" to see if a server (like LinkedIn) can identify you as a bot based on your handshake.

Kiterunner: An API fuzzer that reconstructs valid paths to discover "Shadow APIs" (hidden endpoints) that developers forgot to document or secure.

RESTler: A stateful fuzzer by Microsoft that learns the logic of an API to generate test sequences that can crash the backend or uncover bugs.

Schemathesis: A tool that reads OpenAPI specs and generates test cases to validate logic, which can be combined with AI to autonomously "learn" an API structure.

Protocols (gRPC, GraphQL, WebSocket)
pbtk (Protobuf Toolkit): Used to reverse engineer .proto definitions from binary data or APKs, allowing you to decode Tinder's binary traffic into readable JSON.

Blackbox Protobuf: A Burp Suite extension that automatically decodes Protobuf messages within the proxy so you can edit them without leaving the tool.

protoc (--decode_raw): The official compiler used to decode raw Protobuf blobs into a readable schematic when you don't have the original definition files.

BloomRPC / Kreya: GUI clients used to interact with gRPC services as if they were REST APIs, allowing you to test individual functions once you have the .proto files.

mitmproxy-grpc: An addon for mitmproxy that specifically decodes gRPC streams, enabling you to write Python scripts to modify binary fields in real-time.

InQL: A Burp Suite extension that scans GraphQL endpoints for "introspection" schemas or uses error-based fuzzing to discover hidden fields.

Clairvoyance: A tool used to reconstruct a GraphQL schema by firing thousands of guesses at an API when introspection is disabled.

Apollo Studio (DevTools): A browser extension used to inject a valid GraphQL client into a target website's console, giving you a full GUI to query their backend.

Mobile & Binary Analysis
JADX-GUI: A decompiler used to turn Android APK files (like Tinder) into readable Java/Kotlin code so you can search for API endpoints and logic.

Frida: A dynamic instrumentation toolkit used to inject scripts into running apps (mobile or desktop) to hook functions and bypass client-side checks.

Objection: A mobile exploration toolkit built on Frida used to disable SSL Pinning with a single command so you can intercept mobile app traffic.

Ghidra: The NSA-developed reverse engineering suite used to disassemble and analyze compiled binaries (like plugins or native libraries) to understand their assembly code.

Radare2: A command-line reverse engineering framework used for binary analysis and scripting forensics when a GUI is not required.

Binary Ninja: A modern, clean alternative to Ghidra with a focus on code readability and a powerful API for automating analysis.

dnSpy / ILSpy: Decompilers specifically for .NET (C#) applications that can restore near-perfect source code from compiled Windows executables.

WABT (wasm2c): A toolkit for WebAssembly used to convert binary .wasm files from modern web apps into C code for analysis.

OS, Kernel & Hardware
WinDbg (Preview): The official Windows debugger used for kernel-level analysis, specifically featuring "Time Travel Debugging" to replay crashes and execution flow backward.

QEMU: An emulator used to run operating systems in a virtual sandbox so you can inspect them from the "outside" without detection.

GDB: The GNU Debugger used to attach to QEMU processes to freeze and inspect the memory and CPU state of a running guest operating system.

Volatility 3: A memory forensics tool used to analyze RAM dumps to find hidden processes, passwords, and rootkits that are invisible to the OS itself.

ScyllaHide: A tool used to patch the OS memory structures to hide the presence of your debugger from anti-cheat or anti-tamper software.

Binwalk: A firmware extraction tool used to scan binary blobs (like router updates) and automatically extract the file systems hidden inside.

Saleae Logic: A hardware logic analyzer (mentioned in context) used to read physical signals from chips on a PCB.

Cheat Engine: A memory scanner used to find real-time values (like health or user IDs) in RAM and identify which instructions are writing to them.

Web Frontend & AI
Chrome DevTools: The built-in browser suite used for basic inspection, debugging, and analyzing network activity.

Local Overrides (DevTools): A feature allowing you to replace a live website's JavaScript file with your own local copy to inject logs or bypass checks.

AST Explorer: A web tool used to visualize the Abstract Syntax Tree of obfuscated JavaScript to help write scripts that rename variables based on logic.

Source Map De-obfuscators: Tools used to reconstruct original source code from minified production code if the source maps are exposed.

screenshot-to-code: An AI tool that takes a screenshot of a UI and uses LLMs to generate the corresponding React/Tailwind code to clone the design.

v0.dev: A generative UI tool by Vercel that allows you to build React components via text prompts or image inputs.

Grimoire: A "Vision Agent" concept used to analyze pixel-based UIs (like Canvas elements) where there is no DOM to inspect.

Puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth: A Node.js library used to hide browser automation flags so your scraper looks like a real human user.
