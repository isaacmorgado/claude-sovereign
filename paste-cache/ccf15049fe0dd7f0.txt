2. TypeScript Type Safety (Technical Improvement)
  - Add stricter types to ReflexionAgent
  - Improve error handling types
  - Add JSDoc comments
  - Fix any types

  3. Test Infrastructure (Quality)
  - Create unit tests that don't require API (mock LLM responses)
  - Add test utilities for orchestrator testing
  - Create fixtures for common scenarios

  4. CLI Enhancements (User Experience)
  - Add --help text to all commands
  - Improve error messages
  - Add progress indicators

  5. Code Organization (Maintenance)
  - Refactor large files (like orchestrator)
  - Extract common utilities
  - Clean up unused imports

  6. Integration Documentation (Onboarding)
  - Create step-by-step setup guide
  - Document all feature flags
  - Create troubleshooting FAQ

  Which would you like me to tackle next? Or would you prefer to wait for the API quota reset to run the ReflexionAgent edge case tests?

  My recommendation: #2 TypeScript Type Safety - It's high technical value, doesn't require API calls, and will improve code quality immediately.
