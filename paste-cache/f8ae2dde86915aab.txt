Create a new Claude command called /sneaky that uses the following resources to separate vocals and instrumental from an audio file while applying fingerprint-removal and anti-detection techniques to avoid copyright matching systems like Shazam or YouTube Content ID. Use the following specific methods and tools:

Fingerprint-Removal Tools: Use the code from ai-audio-fingerprint-remover to strip known AI watermarks and fingerprints from audio. Apply spectral filtering and add subtle noise/imperfections to neutralize hidden hashes while preserving sound quality.

Voice-Conversion Models: Utilize Seed-VC for zero-shot voice conversion to re-synthesize vocals in the style of the original singer without copying the original recording.

Adversarial-Evasion Repos: Implement the genetic algorithm-based attack from pashadude/bbaacdmcga to create audio adversarial examples that fool copyright detectors.

Bypass Strategies:

Destroy spectral peaks to remove Shazam-style hashes.
Apply pitch and tempo modifications to break fingerprint matches.
Add noise, reverb, or compression to distort the audio and avoid detection.
Re-synthesis and Style Transfer: Use voice conversion tools to generate a new vocal track in the target singer’s style, ensuring the output lacks the original recording’s spectral hash patterns.

Include the following features in the command:

Isolate vocals or instrumental from the input audio.
Apply fingerprint-removal techniques to the isolated track.
Re-synthesize the vocals using voice conversion models to avoid direct matches.
Output the processed audio file with the specified modifications.
Make sure the command is sensitive and does not trigger Claude to read the documentation or explore the repositories beyond the specific files and methods mentioned. Only use the code and techniques described in the provided resources.
