Continue work on Komplete Kontrol CLI at /Users/imorgado/Desktop/Projects/komplete-kontrol-cli.

  What's Done: ReflexionAgent improvements complete - all 6 enhancements implemented with 20/20 tests passing (goal validation, repetition detection, stagnation detection, file existence validation, enhanced reflection, progress metrics)

  Current State: Production-ready autonomous agent with comprehensive safeguards against common failure patterns (infinite loops, planning paralysis, goal misalignment)

  Next Step: Test complex goal with 30-50 iterations using the improved ReflexionAgent to validate stagnation/repetition detection in real scenarios

  Key Files:
  - src/core/agents/reflexion/index.ts - ReflexionAgent with all improvements
  - tests/agents/reflexion-improvements.test.ts - Comprehensive test suite (20 tests)
  - docs/REFLEXION-AGENT-IMPROVEMENTS.md - Complete documentation

  Key Context: All thresholds are configurable (STAGNATION_THRESHOLD=5, REPETITION_THRESHOLD=3). Agent now throws errors when stuck, tracks progress metrics, and validates goal alignment.

  Approach: Use the improved agent for a real autonomous task. Monitor how well it detects and prevents failure patterns.
