Debug Orchestrator implementation complete. All 6 modules implemented, compiled successfully (81.1 KB, 0 errors), committed and pushed to GitHub (183714c).

  Summary of what was built:

  Debug Orchestrator System (src/core/debug/orchestrator/):
  1. Snapshotter - Creates before/after test snapshots with smart parsing for Jest/Bun/Mocha
  2. Memory - Bug fix memory bank with keyword search and learning
  3. Searcher - GitHub integration (MCP-ready) and codebase search
  4. Verifier - Regression detection comparing snapshots
  5. Recommender - Intelligent fix recommendations with confidence scoring
  6. Main Orchestrator - Coordinates all operations

  Key Features:
  - Smart debug: Snapshot → Search memory → Search GitHub → Generate prompt
  - Fix verification: After snapshot → Detect regression → Recommend action
  - Auto-revert recommendation when tests pass before but fail after fix
  - Memory learning from successful fixes
  - GitHub MCP integration ready

  Next step: LLM integration layer to wire these TypeScript modules into the autonomous system.
