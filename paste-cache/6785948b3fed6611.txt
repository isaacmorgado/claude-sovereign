Defining Musical Attributes
I'm currently focused on extracting the core musical properties from the YouTube video. I'm aiming to identify the beat, style, and beats-per-minute (BPM). This information is crucial for accurately replicating the song's feel in Suno or a similar application.
Acquiring Video Data
I've determined I need to fetch audio tokens due to the user's request for "beat" and "style." I'll use youtube.get_video_information, then search for the BPM, genre, and beat characteristics. I'll construct search queries based on the video title and artist. Finally, I'll present the BPM, style, and a beat/rhythm description to the user.



Defining Musical Characteristics
I've got the song title, "Free Fall" by Tems ft. J. Cole. Now I'm diving into the lyrics and general descriptions, noting its R&B foundation mixed with dancehall elements. The production is dreamy and nostalgic, with a thumping bass and warped cowbell. Sporadic hi-hats are also present.

Defining the Soundscape
I've zeroed in on the track: "Free Fall" by Tems ft. J. Cole. Now, I'm analyzing the soundscape. The beat's described as R&B with dancehall influences, dreamy and nostalgic. The bass is thumping, yet somehow inertia-inducing. I'm also noting the warped cowbell and sporadic hi-hats.
Identifying Key & Tempo
My next step focuses on determining the key and tempo. I've uncovered some potential chord shapes and used that to hypothesize a key. Although I haven't pinned down an exact numerical BPM, I'm trying a final targeted search to confirm it. If that fails, I'll provide an estimated description. I'm exploring different search parameters. I'm hoping I can find the BPM from a video description!

Locating the Target BPM
I am still searching for a direct match of BPM = 100, and it eludes me. I did come across "Blow For Blow (Dj Rukus 90-105 BPM Transition) · Tee Grizzley · J. Cole" which indicates that BPMs in the vicinity of the target do exist, even if not a direct match. This is progress.
Analyzing Key and Genre
I've determined that "Free Fall," played with a capo on the 5th fret using Em shapes, translates to A minor, which aligns with the "minor key feel" indicated by the Em, Am, B progression. I've also confirmed that the R&B/Afrobeat fusion genre tends to sit around the 95-105 BPM range. Given the song's description, I estimate the BPM is likely around 100. I am now trying targeted searches to see if I can find a database that reports these details.

Locating song data
I've successfully identified "Free Fall" by Tems ft. J. Cole. Currently, I have lyrics and visualizer information, but the exact BPM and Key numbers are missing from my initial search. MusicStax provides a listing, though the snippet does not provide me with the specific details I require to continue my process. However, this is just a quick check for numerical values, I will search for these details.
Examining MusicStax snippet
I've circled back to the MusicStax snippet, looking for BPM data, but it's not present. I've inferred the key, likely A minor, from a guitar tutorial result. Genre is a confident guess: R&B/Soul with Afrobeats influence. Since exact BPM is elusive, I'll estimate a range (95-105 BPM) and offer descriptive details for the beat and style. I'm now exploring YouTube for BPM information through instrumental or reaction video titles, as a backup.

Determining Song Details
I've hit a roadblock. YouTube isn't helping me pinpoint the BPM of Tems' "Free Fall" instrumental; the search results are unhelpful. But on a brighter note, I now have the essential building blocks for a Suno prompt: the track title, artist(s), and primary genres (Afro-R&B and Alternative R&B).
Composing the Response
I'm now putting together the final response, structuring it for clarity. I've broken it down into sections: song details, genre/style, beat description, and Suno parameters. I'm focusing on providing the user with a comprehensive answer, including BPM, key, and instrumentation, ensuring it's easy to understand and use. I have the "Free Fall" instrumental details, and I am ready to move to final compilation!
