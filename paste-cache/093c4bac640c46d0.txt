  ## CEP Framework Log
  **File**: `~/Library/Logs/CSXS/CEP12-PPRO.log`

  ```
  2026-01-15 01:20:27:464 : INFO  PlugPlug version : 12.0.1.2
  2026-01-15 01:20:27:464 : INFO  LogLevel : 1
  2026-01-15 01:20:27:464 : ERROR The extension 'com.adobe.LABOR.LearningPanel.AEFT' is not supported for this host
  2026-01-15 01:20:27:466 : ERROR Extension width: '310' should not be less than minimum width: '385'
  ```

  **Analysis**:
  - PlugPlug (CEP framework) version 12.0.1.2 is running
  - Log level is set to 1 (ERROR only)
  - Two errors are present but they are NOT related to SPLICE:
  - Learning Panel extension not supported (Adobe's extension, not SPLICE)
  - Width issue for a different extension (not SPLICE)
