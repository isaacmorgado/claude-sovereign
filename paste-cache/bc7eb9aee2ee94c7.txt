Deep research / complex reasoning
Best abliterated reasoning model (Premium):
👉 huihui-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B-abliterated

Distilled from DeepSeek-R1 onto Qwen2.5-32B, then abliterated for uncensored behavior.
​

32B gives you high-end reasoning capacity; this is the top abliterated reasoning model actually listed in the Featherless catalog for Premium users.
​

DeepSeek-R1 distills are explicitly targeted at complex math, logic, coding and research tasks.
​

Use it for:

Uncensored deep research, multi-step reasoning, and math/logic where you still want something close to R1’s skills.

Anchor (non‑abliterated) model to pair with it:
👉 deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B (non-abliterated)

Same family, but without abliteration; recommended for high-stakes reasoning and final verification.
​

Premium gives you unlimited DeepSeek-R1 and its distills.
​

Architecture & systems design
Best abliterated model for architecture:
👉 Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-abliterated

72.7B parameters, FP8, 32,768 context, public, warm on Featherless.
​

Massive capacity for long, detailed design discussions; uncensored instruction-following on the flagship Qwen2.5 72B base.

Use it for:

High-level system design, trade-off analysis, design docs, and long-form planning where you want “max IQ + uncensored” in one place.

Anchor (non‑abliterated) model to pair with it:
👉 Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct

32B, 128K context, standard recommended model for general reasoning and planning.
​

Use it when you care more about stability/accuracy than uncensored output.

Coding & dev workflows
Best abliterated model that’s close to your dream “uncensored Qwen coder”:
👉 Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct-abliterated (again)

Qwen2.5 Instruct models already have very strong coding skills; abliteration removes refusals while keeping the powerful 72B backbone.
​

With Premium, you can afford its higher concurrency cost (4 units per request) under the plan’s limits.
​

If you need a smaller abliterated option:
👉 huihui-ai/Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct-1M-abliterated

14B, FP8, 16K context, Apache-2.0 license.
​

Uncensored Qwen2.5 Instruct; good compromise between capability and cost.

Anchor (non‑abliterated) coding model:
👉 Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct

SOTA open-source coding model, matches or beats GPT‑4o on many code benchmarks.
​
​

Use it for production coding, refactors, and tests; bring in the abliterated models only when you explicitly need uncensored behavior.

If you tell which of the three (architecture vs research vs coding) you will hit hardest, the next step is to sketch a concrete prompt style for that model pair (abliterated + anchor) so you can route “spicy” vs “precision” tasks cleanly.
