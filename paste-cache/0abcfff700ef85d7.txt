Met this guy last week, got me questioning my sanity
  Different type of energy, he's moving with such confidence
  Other guys I dated, they were boys, not men you see
  But this one got that presence, got me feeling out my element

  The way he talks, the way he walks, it's doing something to my brain
  We think the same on everything, it's driving me insane
  Never thought I'd find someone who gets me on this level
  But I don't trust it yet, my heart's caught in the middle

  [Pre-Chorus]
  I'm confused, I'm excited, I'm scared all at once
  This is new, can't fight it, losing all control
  He's got me feeling ways I never felt before
  Can't help myself, I need to know more

  [Chorus]
  He's a man, he's a man, not a boy like the rest
  Got me impressed, can't even process
  We're so similar, makes me question myself
  Never felt this, can't control myself around him

  He's confident, he's different, he's the one
  This is new, this is fun, can't be done
  But I'm curious, so curious, gotta see
  What's gonna happen between him and me

# SPLICE CEP Console Logs

**Generated**: 2026-01-15 01:24 AM
**Premiere Pro Version**: 25.6.3
**CEP Version**: 12.0.1
**Extension ID**: com.splice.panel.main

---

## Summary

The SPLICE CEP panel is currently running with minimal logging output. The extension appears to be initialized successfully but is only logging at ERROR level (LogLevel: 1).

### Current Status
- ✅ Premiere Pro 2025 is running (Process ID: 28951)
- ✅ CEPHtmlEngine is active (Process ID: 29239)
- ✅ SPLICE panel is loaded from: `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/com.splice.panel`
- ✅ Debug mode appears to be enabled (based on process arguments)

---

## Log Files Location

All SPLICE CEP logs are stored in:
```
~/Library/Logs/CSXS/
```

### Main Log Files:
1. **CEP12-PPRO.log** - Main CEP framework log
2. **CEPHtmlEngine12-PPRO-25.6.3-com.splice.panel.main.log** - Main panel log
3. **CEPHtmlEngine12-PPRO-25.6.3-com.splice.panel.main-renderer.log** - Renderer process log

---

## CEP Framework Log
**File**: `~/Library/Logs/CSXS/CEP12-PPRO.log`

```
2026-01-15 01:20:27:464 : INFO  PlugPlug version : 12.0.1.2
2026-01-15 01:20:27:464 : INFO  LogLevel : 1
2026-01-15 01:20:27:464 : ERROR The extension 'com.adobe.LABOR.LearningPanel.AEFT' is not supported for this host
2026-01-15 01:20:27:466 : ERROR Extension width: '310' should not be less than minimum width: '385'
```

**Analysis**:
- PlugPlug (CEP framework) version 12.0.1.2 is running
- Log level is set to 1 (ERROR only)
- Two errors are present but they are NOT related to SPLICE:
  - Learning Panel extension not supported (Adobe's extension, not SPLICE)
  - Width issue for a different extension (not SPLICE)

---

## SPLICE Panel Main Log
**File**: `~/Library/Logs/CSXS/CEPHtmlEngine12-PPRO-25.6.3-com.splice.panel.main.log`

```
2026-01-15 01:21:53:399 : ERROR ClientInitialized begin
2026-01-15 01:21:53:400 : ERROR ClientInitialized end
```

**Analysis**:
- Client initialization completed in 1ms (01:21:53:399 → 01:21:53:400)
- "ERROR" log level is misleading - these are informational messages logged at ERROR level
- Panel initialized successfully at 1:21:53 AM

**Timing**:
- Premiere Pro launched: 1:20:27 AM
- SPLICE panel initialized: 1:21:53 AM (~86 seconds after Premiere launch)

---

## SPLICE Panel Renderer Log
**File**: `~/Library/Logs/CSXS/CEPHtmlEngine12-PPRO-25.6.3-com.splice.panel.main-renderer.log`

```
2026-01-15 01:21:55.187 CEPHtmlEngine Helper (Renderer)[29244:350932] CoreText failed to get font asset: 0 - (null)
```

**Analysis**:
- Font rendering warning from macOS CoreText
- This is a system-level warning, not a SPLICE-specific error
- Does not affect panel functionality
- Occurs 2 seconds after panel initialization

---

## Process Information

### Running Processes

**Main Application**:
- **Process**: Adobe Premiere Pro 2025
- **PID**: 28951
- **CPU**: 12.0%
- **Memory**: 179 MB
