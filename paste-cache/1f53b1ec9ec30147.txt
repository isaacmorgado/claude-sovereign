Continue work on Komplete Kontrol CLI at /Users/imorgado/Desktop/Projects/komplete-kontrol-cli.

  What's Done:
  - LLM integration layer complete (2,771 lines, 10 modules)
  - Multi-provider support (Anthropic + 7 MCP models)
  - Smart routing, streaming, bash-TypeScript bridge
  - LLM-Enhanced Debugger ready
  - /commit command with quality gates active

  Current State: All TypeScript core systems implemented and tested. LLM layer production-ready (0 type errors, 0 lint errors). Ready to build CLI commands that leverage these systems.

  Next Step: Implement first CLI command (/auto, /sparc, /reflect, or /swarm)

  Key Files:
  - src/core/llm/index.ts (main LLM exports)
  - src/cli/ (TODO - create CLI command infrastructure)
  - .claude/commands/commit.md (quality gate template)

  Key Context:
  - Use createLLMClient() for LLM access
  - Use LLMRouter for smart model selection
  - All systems fully typed and tested
  - TypeScript bundle: 79KB

  Approach: Read CLAUDE.md for full system architecture. Start with /auto command as it's the most critical for autonomous operation.
