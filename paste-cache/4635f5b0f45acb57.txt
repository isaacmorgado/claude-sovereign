1. Documentation Cleanup (High Value)

  Your project has 74+ markdown files - many appear to be session summaries and test reports. We could:
  - Consolidate related docs into organized guides
  - Create a proper /docs structure
  - Archive old session summaries
  - Update README with Phase 2A completion

  2. TypeScript Type Safety (Technical Improvement)

  - Add stricter types to ReflexionAgent
  - Improve error handling types
  - Add JSDoc comments for better IDE support
  - Fix any any types

  3. Test Infrastructure (Quality)

  - Create unit tests that don't require API (mock LLM responses)
  - Add test utilities for orchestrator testing
  - Create fixtures for common test scenarios

  4. CLI Enhancements (User Experience)

  - Add --help text to all commands
  - Improve error messages
  - Add progress indicators
  - Create interactive prompts

  5. Code Organization (Maintenance)

  - Refactor large files (like orchestrator)
  - Extract common utilities
  - Improve code comments
  - Clean up unused imports

  6. Integration Documentation (Onboarding)

  - Create step-by-step setup guide
  - Document all feature flags
  - Create troubleshooting FAQ
  - Add architecture diagrams

  My Recommendation: Start with #1 (Documentation Cleanup) - consolidate the 74+ markdown files into organized, discoverable documentation. This provides immediate value and makes the project more maintainable.
