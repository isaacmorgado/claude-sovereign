Immediate Options (No API Quota Needed)

  1. Test Infrastructure (High Value)

  - Create unit tests that don't require API calls (mock LLM responses)
  - Add test utilities for orchestrator testing
  - Create fixtures for common scenarios
  - Why now: Builds on the type safety work, prevents regressions

  2. CLI Enhancements (User Experience)

  - Add --help text to all commands
  - Improve error messages
  - Add progress indicators for long-running operations
  - Why now: Makes the tool more user-friendly

  3. Code Organization (Maintenance)

  - Refactor large files (like AutoCommand at 1198 lines)
  - Extract common utilities
  - Clean up unused imports (64 warnings to fix)
  - Why now: Code is fresh in mind after type safety work

  4. Integration Documentation (Onboarding)

  - Create step-by-step setup guide
  - Document all feature flags
  - Create troubleshooting FAQ
  - Why now: Help others (and future you) understand the system

  Blocked by API Quota

  5. ReflexionAgent Edge Case Tests

  - Run ./run-edge-case-tests.sh for 30-50 iteration performance
  - Blocked: Kimi-K2 rate limits (24h reset needed)

  My Recommendation

  Start with #3 (Code Organization) because:
  - The 64 lint warnings are low-hanging fruit
  - AutoCommand refactoring will improve maintainability
  - Fresh context from type safety work
  - No external dependencies or API calls needed

  Then move to #1 (Test Infrastructure) to:
  - Lock in the type safety improvements
  - Enable confident refactoring going forward
  - Build the foundation for CI/CD
