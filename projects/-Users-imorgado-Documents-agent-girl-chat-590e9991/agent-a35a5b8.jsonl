It orchestrates the entire deployment process from initial project validation through final deployment status reporting, serving as the default command when users invoke the Vercel CLI.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall the Vercel CLI using `npm i -g vercel`.\n\n### Deployment Workflows\n\nWhen using the Vercel CLI to do a deployment using the `vercel deploy` command, a successful deployment writes the deployed URL to the Standard Output so you can use it in later commands.\n\n### Preview Deployments and Aliasing\n\nYou can use Vercel CLI to create Preview Deployments and can also use the Vercel CLI to alias a URL to that deployment. Each preview deployment has a unique URL. The latest Preview Deployment is automatically aliased to a URL, ensuring you'll have a stable URL pointing to the last Preview Deployment.\n\n### Prebuilt Deployments\n\nThe `--prebuilt` flag will signal to the Vercel CLI that you have already built the project locally and only want to deploy those files (and not your source files) to Vercel. The Vercel CLI will spit out a preview URL.(no content)You can build your application locally (or in a pipeline) without giving Vercel access to the source code through `vercel build`. Vercel automatically detects your frontend framework and generates a `.vercel/output` folder conforming to the Build Output API specification.\n\n### Production Deployments\n\nYou can deploy to production using the same commands, but with the `--prod` flag. When using the `--prod` flag with `vercel build`, the production environment variables will be used instead of the preview environment variables.\n\n### CI/CD Integration\n\nYou can use the Vercel CLI with any CI/CD provider such as Azure DevOps to generate Preview Deployments for every git push and deploy to Production when code is merged into the main branch.

It orchestrates the entire deployment process from initial project validation through final deployment status reporting, serving as the default command when users invoke the Vercel CLI.\n\n### Installation\n\nInstall the Vercel CLI using `npm i -g vercel`.\n\n### Deployment Workflows\n\nWhen using the Vercel CLI to do a deployment using the `vercel deploy` command, a successful deployment writes the deployed URL to the Standard Output so you can use it in later commands.\n\n### Preview Deployments and Aliasing\n\nYou can use Vercel CLI to create Preview Deployments and can also use the Vercel CLI to alias a URL to that deployment. Each preview deployment has a unique URL. The latest Preview Deployment is automatically aliased to a URL, ensuring you'll have a stable URL pointing to the last Preview Deployment.\n\n### Prebuilt Deployments\n\nThe `--prebuilt` flag will signal to the Vercel CLI that you have already built the project locally and only want to deploy those files (and not your source files) to Vercel. The Vercel CLI will spit out a preview URL.(no content)You can build your application locally (or in a pipeline) without giving Vercel access to the source code through `vercel build`. Vercel automatically detects your frontend framework and generates a `.vercel/output` folder conforming to the Build Output API specification.\n\n### Production Deployments\n\nYou can deploy to production using the same commands, but with the `--prod` flag. When using the `--prod` flag with `vercel build`, the production environment variables will be used instead of the preview environment variables.\n\n### CI/CD Integration\n\nYou can use the Vercel CLI with any CI/CD provider such as Azure DevOps to generate Preview Deployments for every git push and deploy to Production when code is merged into the main branch. This approach is useful for developers seeking full control over their CI/CD pipeline, those unable to use Vercel's Git integration or those with a trunk-based development workflow.\n\n### Global Options\n\nThe `--cwd` option can be used to provide a working directory (that can be different from the current directory) when running CLI commands. This option can be a relative or absolute path.(no content)The `--debug` option, shorthand `-d`, can be used to provide a more verbose output when running CLI commands.\n\nFor the most comprehensive and up-to-date documentation, you can visit the official Vercel CLI documentation at [vercel.com/docs/cli](https://vercel.com/docs/cli)."],"durationSeconds":20.304328415999997}}

It allows you to define settings and behaviors for your project.\n\n## Key Configuration Options\n\nThe file supports:\n- **Configuration**: Define build and output settings for your project\n- **Routing**: Set up custom routes, redirects, rewrites, and headers\n- **Environment variables**: Manage environment variables for different environments (development, preview, production)\n- **Regions**: Specify which Vercel regions your functions should be deployed to\n- **Build and output settings**: Configure the build process and output directory\n\n## Example Configurations\n\n### Functions Configuration\nYou can configure functions with memory and duration settings:\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json\",\n  \"functions\": {\n    \"api/test.js\": {\n      \"memory\": 3009,\n      \"maxDuration\": 30\n    },\n    \"api/*.js\": {\n      \"memory\": 3009,\n      \"maxDuration\": 30\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Git Configuration (New in 2025)\nVercel now supports glob patterns in the git.deploymentEnabled field, giving you more control over branch deployments. You can use patterns to match multiple branches at once. For example, the configuration below prevents deployments on Vercel if the branch begins with internal-:\n```json\n{\n  \"git\": {\n    \"deploymentEnabled\": {\n      \"internal-*\": false\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Frontend + Backend Project\nFor projects with both frontend and backend:\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 3,\n  \"installCommand\": \"npm install --legacy-peer-deps\",\n  \"builds\": [\n    { \"src\": \"server/index.js\", \"use\": \"@vercel/node\" },\n    { \"src\": \"client/package.json\", \"use\": \"@vercel/static-build\", \"config\": { \"distDir\": \"build\" } }\n  ],\n  \"routes\": [\n    { \"src\": \"/api/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"server/index.js\" },\n    { \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"client/build/$1\" }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Redirects with Geo-targeting\nYou can set up redirects based on headers like country:\n```json\n{\n  \"$schema\": \"https://openapi.vercel.sh/vercel.json\",\n  \"redirects\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/:path((?!uk/).*)\",\n      \"has\": [{ \"type\": \"header\", \"key\": \"x-vercel-ip-country\", \"value\": \"GB\" }],\n      \"destination\": \"/uk/:path*\",\n      \"permanent\": false\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Headers (CORS)\nFor adding headers like CORS:\n```json\n{\n  \"headers\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/api/(.*)\",\n      \"headers\": [\n        { \"key\": \"Access-Control-Allow-Origin\", \"value\": \"*\" }\n      ]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Recent Updates\n\nAs of April 23, 2025, Fluid compute is enabled by default for new projects.(no content)Note: Using `has` does not yet work locally while using vercel dev, but does work when deployed.\n\nFor the complete and most up-to-date documentation, visit the official [Vercel Project Configuration docs](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"7b2ff15e-5624-4268-8fef-9c04d7026b12","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:52:13.311Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"vercel.json complete example configuration 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01FR2SiXinRrWEDMLEunjMEY","content":[{"title":"Configuring projects with vercel.json","url":"https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration"},{"title":"vercel.json. -the vercel.json file in a backend… | by Naman Ahuja | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@palindromicnamed/vercel-json-c6101c98e5c2"},{"title":"vercel-builder/examples/basic/vercel.json at main · nuxt/vercel-builder","url":"https://github.com/nuxt/vercel-builder/blob/main/examples/basic/vercel.json"},{"title":"vercel.json file. -it allows you to define settings and… | by Naman Ahuja | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@palindromicnamed/the-vercel-json-9bdb33938ef3"},{"title":"Configure vercel.json for Python FastAPI backend and Next.JS frontend - Help - Vercel Community","url":"https://community.vercel.com/t/configure-vercel-json-for-python-fastapi-backend-and-next-js-frontend/8816"},{"title":"Project settings","url":"https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration/project-settings"},{"title":"Configuring a Build","url":"https://vercel.com/docs/builds/configure-a-build"},{"title":"Mastering vercel.json with Frontend Backend Projects on Vercel","url":"https://peerlist.io/mahmudrahman/articles/mastering-verceljson-a-beginnerfriendly-guide-to-vercel-conf"},{"title":"Granular branch matching for Git configuration in vercel.json - Vercel","url":"https://vercel.com/changelog/granular-branch-matching-for-git-configuration-in-vercel-json"},{"title":"Advanced Configuration","url":"https://vercel.com/docs/functions/configuring-functions/advanced-configuration"}]},"Based on the search results, here's information about `vercel.json` configuration examples for 2025:\n\n## Overview\n\nThe vercel.json file is used to configure deployments on Vercel, a platform for deploying web applications.
