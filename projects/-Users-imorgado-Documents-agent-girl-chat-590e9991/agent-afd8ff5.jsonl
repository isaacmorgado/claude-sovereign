It provides the ability to discover UXP-compatible Adobe apps, load your development plugins in a target app (no symlinks or deep file system spelunking required), reload your currently running plugin instance with new changes (no app restart required), launch a rich DevTools environment for debugging your plugin, and view your plugin logs.(no content)UXP Devtools are available in form of CLI and Standalone application both.\n\n## Key Commands and Options\n\n### Service Commands\nThe UXP CLI and Adobe apps communicate with each other using a WebSocket connection. For this to happen, you must start the CLI service from the command line. This runs a server at an optionally specified port.\n\n**Start Service:**\n```\n$ uxp service start [--port <port>]\n```\nOptions: `--port`: The port is where the service will run, defaults to 14001.\n\n### Help Commands\n`$ uxp help` prints details of all the commands available in the CLI, and `$ uxp <command> help` prints details of a specific command.\n\n### Plugin Commands\n\n**Debug Plugin:**\nAfter you have loaded your plugin once with `uxp plugin load`, you can debug the plugin using the debug command. The `--apps` option lets you choose the app in which you want to limit the debugging to if your plugin is loaded in multiple apps. By default you will be able to debug all connected apps specified in your manifest.json.\n\n**Unload Plugin:**\nYou can unload a plugin from a host app. The `--apps` option specifies a list of apps that you want to unload the plugin from. If you don't provide this argument, the CLI will look into the host entry details in your manifest.json file and unload the plugin from all supported apps that are currently connected to the CLI service. If more than one version of the app is running, you can limit this to a specific version by appending the version string to the app ID.\n\n**Watch/Reload:**\n`--apps` can also specify a list of apps that you want to watch the plugin for and reload contents on change.\n\n### Plugin Testing (v1.3+)\nA command is available for plugin developers to run automated UI tests on UXP Plugins - `uxp plugin test`. The tests can be written using standard web automation frameworks like WebDriverIO and UDT CLI gives you a way to run these in an Adobe App.(no content)The initial automation setup can be done using the init command, which will create a folder named \"uxp-plugin-tests\" and install the required dependencies to execute the testsuite.\n\n### View Logs\nAfter you have loaded your plugin once with `uxp plugin load`, you can view plugin logs using a specific command that launches a plugin console window where logs can be viewed.\n\n## Installation Notes\n\nOn Windows you need to run these commands in PowerShell or Command Prompt. You need to add the yarn global bin path to the PATH environment variable to access the `uxp` command directly from the command line.\n\nFor the complete official documentation, refer to:\n- **npm package**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/uxp-devtools-cli\n- **GitHub repo**: https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4537932e-83c5-4ba4-b4bf-f1fd2548fb11","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:51:40.731Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP CLI commands flags options official","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_012JtspSTZmUu6VcYdkiUbjZ","content":[{"title":"How to Install UXP Plugins Using Command Line Tools","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/how-to-install-uxp-plugins-using-command-line-tools-a6a62ca4cb1a"},{"title":"adobe/uxp-devtools-cli","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/uxp-devtools-cli"},{"title":"GitHub - adobe-uxp/devtools-cli: CLI for UXP developer tools, including creating, loading and debugging plugins.","url":"https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli"},{"title":"The UXP Toolchain","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/uxp-toolchain/"},{"title":"Releases · adobe-uxp/devtools-cli","url":"https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli/releases"},{"title":"Adobe","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/reference/commands/"},{"title":"adobe-fixed-uxp/uxp-devtools-cli","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe-fixed-uxp/uxp-devtools-cli"},{"title":"adobe-fixed-uxp/uxp-devtools-cli - npm Package Overview","url":"https://socket.dev/npm/package/@adobe-fixed-uxp/uxp-devtools-cli"},{"title":"devtools-cli/README.md at main · adobe-uxp/devtools-cli","url":"https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli/blob/main/README.md"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #4 Commands, Panels and the manifest.json | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/adobe-uxp-things-you-need-to-know-4-commands-panels-manifest"}]},"Based on my search, here's an overview of Adobe UXP CLI commands, flags, and options:\n\n## Adobe UXP CLI Overview\n\nUXP Devtools is a standard tool for rapid Adobe UXP plugin development.

In addition to core metadata such as the plugin's name, version, icons, and entry points, the manifest specifies permissions, compatibility details, and other definitions that shape how the plugin integrates with the host environment.\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n- Premiere supports manifest version \"5\".\n- Most importantly, it contains your plugin ID, which uniquely identifies your plugin when it's installed in the host application.\n- Valid plugin IDs are required for distributing in Adobe's Marketplace.\n\n### Main Manifest Fields\n\nBased on the documentation, the manifest includes these key sections:\n\n1. **Basic Metadata**: plugin name, version, ID\n2. **Icons**: All fields are required unless otherwise noted. Icons are not required during development, but must be provided when distributing through the Plugin Marketplace.\n3. **Host Definition**: The host field is an object matching the HostDefinition format. This entry allows your plugin to specify which app your plugin can run on. During development, the field can contain an array of HostDefinitions. However, during submission to the marketplace, only one HostDefinition is allowed.\n4. **Entry Points**: The entrypoints field is an array of objects. These entries appear both in the Plugins menu in the native menubar, and the plugin panel. Each entry point specifies a type, to create either a direct-action command or a panel show/hide command.\n\n### Permissions\n\nTo ensure that plugins are secure, UXP requires that plugins declare the permissions they need to function. Permissions not explicitly declared will be denied by default.(no content)The clipboard permission enables the plugin to read and write to the clipboard. Options include: read (enables reading from clipboard), readAndWrite (enables read and write access). Default value is undefined (no clipboard access).(no content)Permission-based APIs also need to be allow-listed in your plugin's manifest.json. For example, to use the file system or make network requests, you must declare the appropriate permissions.\n\n### Additional Fields\n\n- **Strings/Localization**: It can also be a path to a JSON file containing them. See the StringsDefinition section for more details.\n- **Feature Flags**: A set of feature flags that can be used to enable or disable certain features of the plugin. These flags are used to gate features that are not yet ready for general availability.\n- **Hybrid Plugins**: Addon definitions for hybrid plugins. A UXP Hybrid plugin is a UXP plugin that can access the power of C++ native libraries. Premiere doesn't support hybrid plugins yet.\n\n### Development Note\n\nIf you make any changes to the manifest.json file, you must manually unload and reload the plugin. In the UXP Developer Tool, in the row for your plugin, click Unload and then Load & Watch once more.\n\nFor complete examples and detailed documentation, visit the official source at: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"020ad176-503c-4905-8dbd-33a1b905abb3","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:52:58.828Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"manifest.json example Premiere Pro UXP plugin complete structure site:developer.adobe.com","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01FWMZdpwpjDDN438DbMxKur","content":[{"title":"Plugin manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"Building your first UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/"},{"title":"Manifest File Structure - UXP Manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"The manifest.json file (v4)","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/manifest/"},{"title":"Starters and samples","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/starters-samples/"},{"title":"Get started - UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/getting-started/"},{"title":"Manifest File Structure","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2021/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/"},{"title":"The manifest.json file (v3)","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/manifest-v3/"},{"title":"Plugin Lifecycle Hooks","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/tutorials/add-lifecycle-hooks/"}]},"Based on my search results, here's information about the manifest.json structure for Premiere Pro UXP plugins from Adobe's official developer documentation:\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP Plugin manifest.json Structure\n\nEach UXP plugin must have one manifest.json file that the host application uses to load and manage the plugin.

See the StringsDefinition section for more details.\n- **Feature Flags**: A set of feature flags that can be used to enable or disable certain features of the plugin. These flags are used to gate features that are not yet ready for general availability.\n- **Hybrid Plugins**: Addon definitions for hybrid plugins. A UXP Hybrid plugin is a UXP plugin that can access the power of C++ native libraries. Premiere doesn't support hybrid plugins yet.\n\n### Development Note\n\nIf you make any changes to the manifest.json file, you must manually unload and reload the plugin. In the UXP Developer Tool, in the row for your plugin, click Unload and then Load & Watch once more.\n\nFor complete examples and detailed documentation, visit the official source at: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"],"durationSeconds":23.942058791999997}}

In addition to core metadata such as the plugin's name, version, icons, and entry points, the manifest specifies permissions, compatibility details, and other definitions that shape how the plugin integrates with the host environment.(no content)The `manifestVersion` field indicates the version of the manifest schema. Premiere supports version \"5\".(no content)The entrypoints array defines the entrypoints that the plugin provides; currently, only Commands and Panels are supported.\n\n### Example Code Structure\n\nHere's an example manifest.json structure based on the documentation:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"YOUR_PLUGIN_ID_HERE\",\n  \"name\": \"My Premiere Pro Plugin\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"premierepro\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"25.0.0\"\n  },\n  \"entrypoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"command\",\n      \"id\": \"myCommand\",\n      \"label\": {\n        \"default\": \"My Command\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"myPanel\",\n      \"label\": {\n        \"default\": \"My Panel\"\n      },\n      \"minimumSize\": {\"width\": 230, \"height\": 200},\n      \"maximumSize\": {\"width\": 2000, \"height\": 2000},\n      \"preferredDockedSize\": {\"width\": 230, \"height\": 300},\n      \"preferredFloatingSize\": {\"width\": 230, \"height\": 300}\n    }\n  ],\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"width\": 23,\n      \"height\": 23,\n      \"path\": \"icons/icon_dark.png\",\n      \"scale\": [1, 2],\n      \"theme\": [\"dark\", \"darkest\"]\n    },\n    {\n      \"width\": 23,\n      \"height\": 23,\n      \"path\": \"icons/icon_light.png\",\n      \"scale\": [1, 2],\n      \"theme\": [\"lightest\", \"light\"]\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Key Features of Manifest v5\n\nStarting with v5, any permissions not explicitly declared in the manifest are not granted by default. In order for your plugin to use the network, you must define domains that your plugin will access. You can do this by adding the network object to the requiredPermissions section of the manifest.\n\n### Command Entrypoints\n\nCommand entrypoints are the most common type of entrypoint. They allow you to add commands to the Premiere Pro user interface. When the user runs a command, your plugin can perform a variety of actions, such as opening a dialog and changing the document.(no content)In your manifest.json file, register a new command-type entrypoint. This will add a new command entrypoint with the ID \"myCommand\" to your plugin.

For this to happen, you must start the CLI service from the command line. This runs a server at an optionally specified port.\n\n```\n$ uxp service start [--port <port>]\n```\n\nOptions: `--port`: The port is where the service will run, defaults to 14001.\n\n### Plugin Load Command\n\n**`uxp plugin load`**\nLoading a plugin can be done with: `uxp plugin load --manifest \"dist/manifest.json\"`(no content)Note: This command will prompt you with an OS credentials dialog. This is done so that random external scripts can't issue plugin load commands to the apps to load unauthorized plugins without user knowledge.\n\n### Plugin Reload Command\n\n**`uxp plugin reload`**\nAfter you have loaded your plugin once with `uxp plugin load`, you can reload the plugin into the host application using this command. If you don't provide the `--apps` argument, the CLI will look into the host entry details in your manifest.json file and reload the plugin into all supported apps that are currently connected to the CLI service.\n\nOptions:\n- `--apps`: A list of apps that you want to reload the plugin into.\n- If more than one version of the app is running, you can limit this app to a specific version by appending the version string to the app ID.(no content)Note: This will reload all changes done in the plugin except for manifest changes. To reload your manifest, you will need to run `uxp plugin load`.\n\n### Auto-Reload with Nodemon\nFor auto-reload during development, you can run: `npx nodemon --exec \"uxp plugin reload\" -e js,jsx,html`\n\n### Other Useful Commands\n\n**Help Commands:**\n`$ uxp help` prints details of all the commands available in the CLI. `$ uxp <command> help` prints details of a specific command.\n\n**Enable/Disable DevTools:**\n`uxp devtools enable` - Required to enable devtools. `uxp devtools disable` - Disables devtools when done.\n\n**List Connected Apps:**\nYou can list connected Adobe applications using `$ uxp apps list`, which shows the ID, version, and name of each connected app.\n\n**Plugin Debug:**\nAfter you have loaded your plugin once with `uxp plugin load`, you can debug the plugin. The `--apps` option lets you choose the app in which you want to limit debugging.\n\n### Workflow Summary\n\nThe UXP DevTools CLI allows you to reload your currently running plugin instance with new changes (no app restart required), launch a rich DevTools environment for debugging your plugin, and view your plugin logs.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e08dfb94-8912-4ecc-a7dd-eed4a3225988","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:53:51.514Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"uxp service start\" \"uxp plugin load\" \"uxp plugin reload\" CLI command reference","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01JNGGuoZyVB2chDVWaZpFaP","content":[{"title":"@adobe/uxp-devtools-cli - npm","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/uxp-devtools-cli"},{"title":"@apoorva2405/uxp-devtools-cli - npm","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@apoorva2405/uxp-devtools-cli"},{"title":"@adobe-fixed-uxp/uxp-devtools-cli - npm","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe-fixed-uxp/uxp-devtools-cli"},{"title":"@adobe-fixed-uxp/uxp-devtools-cli - npm Package Security Ana...","url":"https://socket.dev/npm/package/@adobe-fixed-uxp/uxp-devtools-cli"},{"title":"GitHub - adobe-uxp/devtools-cli: CLI for UXP developer tools, including creating, loading and debugging plugins.","url":"https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli"},{"title":"Releases · adobe-uxp/devtools-cli","url":"https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli/releases"},{"title":"GitHub - xWermuth/adobe.uxp.react.typescript.starter: Template for uxp react typescript","url":"https://github.com/xWermuth/adobe.uxp.react.typescript.starter"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #3 UXP Developer Tool | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/Adobe-UXP-things-you-need-to-know-3-UXP-developer-tool.html"},{"title":"Photoshop Plugins With UXP: Panels & Commands | Francesco's GameDev Corner","url":"https://minifloppy.it/posts/2024/photoshop-plugins-with-uxp-panels-commands/"},{"title":"UXP Plugin Load: Websocket error [object Object] · Issue #11 · adobe-uxp/devtools-cli","url":"https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli/issues/11"}]},"Based on my search results, here's the CLI command reference for the Adobe UXP DevTools CLI:\n\n## UXP DevTools CLI Command Reference\n\n### Service Commands\n\n**`uxp service start`**\nThe UXP CLI and Adobe apps communicate with each other using a WebSocket connection.

Required Folder Structure\n\n```\nyour-plugin/\n├── manifest.json          # Plugin metadata\n├── index.html            # Entry point (referenced in manifest.main)\n├── index.js              # Main JavaScript file\n├── icons/\n│   ├── dark.png          # 23x23 @1x dark theme\n│   ├── dark@2x.png       # 23x23 @2x dark theme\n│   ├── light.png         # 23x23 @1x light theme\n│   ├── light@2x.png      # 23x23 @2x light theme\n│   ├── plugin-icon.png   # 48x48 @1x plugin list\n│   └── plugin-icon@2x.png # 48x48 @2x plugin list\n├── assets/               # Optional: additional resources\n└── types.d.ts            # Optional: TypeScript definitions\n```\n\n### 5. Development Workflow\n\n**Setup:**\n1. Enable Developer Mode in Premiere Pro: Settings > Plugins > Enable developer mode (restart required)\n2. Install UXP Developer Tool v2.2+ from Creative Cloud\n3. Start UXP service: `uxp service start`\n\n**Load & Develop:**\n```bash\n# Load plugin\nuxp plugin load --manifest \"path/to/manifest.json\"\n\n# Watch for changes (auto-reload)\n# In UDT GUI: Click \"Load & Watch\"\n# OR use nodemon: npx nodemon --exec \"uxp plugin reload\" -e js,jsx,html\n\n# Debug\nuxp plugin debug\n```\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Manifest changes require full unload/reload (not just reload)\n- Watch feature auto-reloads code changes (not manifest changes)\n- DevTools requires admin privileges\n- Plugin ID required for marketplace distribution\n\n### 6. Premiere Pro Host Configuration\n\n```json\n\"host\": {\n  \"app\": \"premierepro\",\n  \"minVersion\": \"25.0.0\"\n}\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Premiere Pro 25.0+ (25.6+ recommended for latest features)\n- UXP Developer Tool v2.2+\n- Developer mode enabled in Premiere Pro settings\n\n**Permissions (v5 - explicit declaration required):**\n- `localFileSystem`: `\"request\"` | `\"fullAccess\"`\n- `clipboard`: `\"read\"` | `\"readAndWrite\"`\n- `network.domains`: Array of allowed domains\n- `launchProcess`: For spawning external processes\n- `ipc`: For inter-process communication\n\n---\n\n## Sources:\n- [Adobe UXP Developer Tool](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/devtool/)\n- [CLI Repository - GitHub](https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli)\n- [Premiere Pro Dev Tools](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/)\n- [Plugin Manifest Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/)\n- [Premiere Pro Samples - GitHub](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [Building First Plugin](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/)\n- [Plugin Workflows](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/tutorials/udt-deep-dive/plugin-workflows/)\n- [Adding Command Entrypoints](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/tutorials/adding-command-entrypoints/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":766,"cache_read_input_tokens":24837,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":766,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWBBtPYb2jZ9jBRf4XddY","type":"assistant","uuid":"ec61f46d-6869-40a8-9351-5d00e6400054","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:54:30.233Z"}
