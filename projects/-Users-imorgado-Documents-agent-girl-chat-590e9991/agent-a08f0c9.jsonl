The official Adobe developer documentation at `developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/folder-structure/` provides specific details on folder structure requirements.\n\n### Creating Plugin Structure\n\nYou can either create the plugin folder structure and files from scratch and click the blue Add Plugin button in the Tool, or you can click the Create Plugin button to have it created for you, wizard-style.\n\n### Using the UXP Developer Tool\n\nYou can create your plugin directly in the UXP Developer Tool. To do so, open the UXP Developer Tool and click Create Plugin. This opens a dialog where you can enter the details for your plugin. Then click Select Folder and choose a location on your machine where you want to create the plugin. The UXP Developer Tool will create a new folder with the name you specified in the location you specified. The folder will contain the following files.\n\n### Plugin Installation Locations (Windows)\n\nOn Windows PCs, UXP plugins can be found at C:\\Users\\[YourUsername]\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\UXP\\Plugins\\External\n\n### Essential Files\n\nBefore you package your plugin for distribution outside your own computer, make sure you've obtained a valid ID from the Developer Distribution portal. Without an id (which goes in the id field of your plugin's manifest.json file), you won't be able to distribute your plugin in the Creative Cloud Marketplace.(no content)If you make any changes to the manifest.json file, you'll need to fully unload and reload the plugin.\n\n### Packaging\n\nUXP plugins for Photoshop are distributed in the form of a .ccx file. Under the hood, this is a zip file. Unless you have some special requirements, you should not be creating this zip file yourself.\n\n### Key Resources\n\n- **Main Documentation**: https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/\n- **XD Folder Structure**: https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/folder-structure/\n- **InDesign Plugin Guide**: https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/plugins/getting-started/\n- GitHub repository for UXP documentation: AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop - Documentation for UXP Plugin API - Adobe Photoshop 2022 - apiVersion 2\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ec4f5b76-98b0-4b49-be0f-d530fa7584e1","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:51:37.523Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP plugin folder structure official documentation 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01NKxa5nRoFhVQY8vw2Dtdee","content":[{"title":"Documentation-UXP for Adobe Photoshop","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/"},{"title":"Adobe","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/uxp/"},{"title":"Folder Structure","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/folder-structure/"},{"title":"Where does Adobe CC stores the 3rd party UXP-Plugin information for Photoshop in Windows?","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem-discussions/where-does-adobe-cc-stores-the-3rd-party-uxp-plugin-information-for-photoshop-in-windows/td-p/15164241"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop: Documentation for UXP Plugin API - Adobe Photoshop 2022 - apiVersion 2","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop"},{"title":"Get started - UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/plugins/getting-started/"},{"title":"Packaging Your Plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/distribution/packaging-your-plugin/"},{"title":"Documentation-Adobe XD","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp"},{"title":"Storage APIs · Adobe XD Plugin Reference","url":"https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/reference/uxp/storage-index.html"},{"title":"UXP Developer Tool (UDT) Walkthrough guide","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/devtool/udt-walkthrough/"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about Adobe UXP plugin folder structure from the official documentation:\n\n## Adobe UXP Plugin Folder Structure\n\n### Official Documentation Sources\n\nWhen you have the right structure for your XD plugin, it will look like this: Within the parent folder, you'll need at minimum two files, with these exact names.

UXP v7.0 introduces the support for Web Components and Spectrum Web Components (SWC).\n\n## Three UI Options in UXP\n\nUXP supports the UI to be written in three ways using standard HTML Elements, built-in Spectrum UXP widgets, and Spectrum Web Components (recently added).\n\nKey terminology:\n- Web components are HTML5 Web technology that lets you define custom HTML tags. Adobe Spectrum Web Components (popularly known as SWC) is an open-source library that has Spectrum-styled web components.\n\n## SWC Features\n\nThe support for SWC in UXP is more extensive. It has 30 components including some unique ones that are not available in Spectrum widgets such as table, toast, card etc.(no content)In order to use them, you are required to install the components individually and then import them before using the component tag.\n\n## Plugin Structure\n\nFor React-based SWC plugins:\n- This starter will help you to create a React based UXP plugin using Spectrum Web Component (SWC). It includes setting up the project, integrating the SWC components, and mounting it over the host application - Photoshop.\n\nKey setup requirements:\n- Enable SWC by setting the enableSWCSupport flag to true.\n- Ensure that the components are wrapped with a Theme component. It ensures that the Spectrum design tokens are delivered to the scoped HTML context.(no content)The UXP-SWC components are delivered via wrappers over specific SWC versions. For example, @swc-uxp-wrappers/menu is locked and wrapped on 0.16.9 version of @spectrum-web-components/menu. Thereby for React framework we will need to use @swc-react/menu:0.16.9-react.3029 which is the react-wrapper closest to the SWC component version.\n\n## Version Information\n\nWith UXP v8.0.0, all the SWC components in UXP are locked to version 0.37.0.\n\n## Starter Templates Available\n\nUse command-line tools (starter templates) for setting up a new UXP-based React/Vanilla app with SWC bundling. It helps you quickly scaffold a project optimized for building UXP plugins using SWC.(no content)Photoshop React-based SWC starter plugin (since UXP v7.3). InDesign React-based SWC starter plugin (since UXP v7.3).\n\n## Platform Considerations\n\nKeep in mind that UXP is not a browser. It's a platform that provides the ease of using web technologies to build plugins/scripts for desktop applications. Hence, it does not support all the HTML/CSS capabilities you can use in a browser.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nIf you are looking for a ready-made Adobe Spectrum-styled UI or are just getting started with programming your UI, we recommend you start your journey with SWC. Fall back to Spectrum UXP widgets for variants in the comps that are not available yet. And use plain HTML elements when they are not available in either.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"bc5127fe-83f7-4fe9-88b7-e7c551d6cd04","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:51:41.060Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe Spectrum Web Components UXP plugin structure","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_016kBjwczzxzNmDNbTRriAGU","content":[{"title":"Spectrum Web Component (SWC)","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/swc/"},{"title":"Spectrum UXP Reference","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/"},{"title":"Spectrum Web Component - GitHub Pages","url":"https://adobedocs.github.io/uxp-photoshop/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/swc/"},{"title":"Spectrum UXP Reference","url":"https://adobedocs.github.io/uxp-photoshop/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/"},{"title":"GitHub - thejustinwalsh/react-uxp-spectrum: Adobe UXP Spectrum Web Components for React","url":"https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/react-uxp-spectrum"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #9 Adobe Spectrum | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/adobe-uxp-things-you-need-to-know-9-adobe-spectrum-uxp"},{"title":"Create UI in UXP Spectrum UXP Reference","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/resources/fundamentals/create-ui/"},{"title":"How to use Spectrum components in UXP plugin? - Adobe XD - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/how-to-use-spectrum-components-in-uxp-plugin/5625"},{"title":"UXP Plugin with Spectrum Web Component in React context","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/blob/main/swc-uxp-react-starter/README.md"},{"title":"Have you tried using Spectrum Web Components yet to build your plugin UI? - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/have-you-tried-using-spectrum-web-components-yet-to-build-your-plugin-ui/7106"}]},"Based on my search results, here's the information about Adobe Spectrum Web Components and UXP plugin structure:\n\n## Overview\n\nSpectrum Web Components are open-source Adobe Spectrum-styled Web Components.

UXP provides a set of common JavaScript APIs that are available in these Host Applications and the types are available for these common set of UXP JavaScript APIs.(no content)Type definitions for the Host Application provided JavaScript APIs are present in separate repos and will need to be installed separately.\n\n### Installing Type Definitions\n\nInstall the types via npm: `npm install @adobe/cc-ext-uxp-types`(no content)For using the UXP Type Definitions within your code editor, you need to create a `tsconfig.json` in your TypeScript project and add reference to the type declaration in compilerOptions.\n\n### TypeScript Configuration (tsconfig.json)\n\nTo make sure that UXP types do not conflict with the available web standard DOM types, update the required lib options to exclude these standard types.\n\nThe recommended configuration includes:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"typeRoots\": [\n      \"node_modules/@types\",\n      \"node_modules/@adobe/cc-ext-uxp-types\"\n    ],\n    \"lib\": [\"ES2015\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Boilerplate/Starter Projects\n\nThere are several starter templates available:\n\n1. **Bolt UXP** - A lightning-fast boilerplate for building Adobe UXP Plugins in Svelte, React, or Vue built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass.\n\n2. **Adobe Official React TypeScript Template** - You can use `@adobe/uxp-template-ps-react-typescript` in your project by running `npm i @adobe/uxp-template-ps-react-typescript`.\n\n3. **Community React TypeScript Starter** - This plugin is a good place to get started when building a Photoshop plugin using React. It comes defined with all the dependencies that you'll need to get started. As this is a React project, you'll need to do some initial configuration before this will be usable in Photoshop.\n\n### Development Workflow\n\nUXP is used for debugging the application. There is both a UI interface in Adobe Creative Cloud Store and a CLI. This application uses the CLI script to run the application in watch mode (hot reload).\n\n### Alternative Type Definitions\n\nThere's also a community package (uxp-types) that is a simple drop-in set of types with minimal configuration that also supports importing uxp and photoshop directly in TypeScript projects. The uxp types have been generated by running dts-gen in the Adobe UXP Developer Tools within Photoshop then hand modified to better type the API.\n\n### Basic Setup Steps\n\nThe basic steps include: Download VSCode, download and install Node.js, open VSCode and then open terminal in your project, run `npm install -g typescript`, create a TypeScript config file using terminal with `tsc --init` and accept the defaults, then rename your main.js file.(no content)Note that you don't have to write your code in TypeScript to make use of typings. Plain vanilla JavaScript will work just fine with them.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"abd26ff8-d559-417a-a05d-c9bb760814df","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:51:49.669Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP plugin project organization best practices TypeScript","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_015U5R6gfX7obHWMWqT59GFA","content":[{"title":"Need help getting started with Typescript for UXP plugin development","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-developers-discussions/need-help-getting-started-with-typescript-for-uxp-plugin-development/td-p/14392001"},{"title":"GitHub - xWermuth/adobe.uxp.react.typescript.starter: Template for uxp react typescript","url":"https://github.com/xWermuth/adobe.uxp.react.typescript.starter"},{"title":"adobe/cc-ext-uxp-types","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/cc-ext-uxp-types"},{"title":"GitHub - thejustinwalsh/uxp-types: Typescript definitions for the Adobe UXP API","url":"https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/uxp-types"},{"title":"GitHub - hyperbrew/bolt-uxp: A lightning-fast boilerplate for building Adobe UXP Plugins in Svelte, React, or Vue built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass","url":"https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp"},{"title":"GitHub - adobe/cc-ext-uxp-types","url":"https://github.com/adobe/cc-ext-uxp-types"},{"title":"Need help getting started with TypeScript for Photoshop UXP - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/need-help-getting-started-with-typescript-for-photoshop-uxp/7451"},{"title":"@adobe/uxp-template-ps-react-typescript - npm","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/uxp-template-ps-react-typescript"},{"title":"How to use Typescript in your UXP plugin in 78 easy steps! - UXP Developer Tool - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/how-to-use-typescript-in-your-uxp-plugin-in-78-easy-steps/5646"},{"title":"Plans for UXP in 2023.

Each UXP plugin has one manifest.json file that describes the plugin.(no content)It contains metadata such as the plugin's name, version, icons, and entry points. The manifest file also contains the permissions that the plugin requires.(no content)The manifest is located in your plugin's root folder and must be named manifest.json.\n\n## Required Files Structure\n\nYou start by creating an empty directory and adding a manifest.json file inside it. The manifest file contains information about the plugin such as its unique id, name, version, etc.(no content)You'll also need additional files like index.html and index.js. These define the UI and code for the panel.\n\n## Key Manifest Fields\n\nThe required fields are categorized as: \"Develop\" - required field for the plugin to be loaded, and \"Publish\" - required field for plugins to be submitted in the Adobe Developer Console and published in the Plugin Manager.(no content)The host field is an object matching the HostDefinition format. This entry allows your plugin to specify which app your plugin can run on such as Adobe XD or Photoshop.(no content)The entrypoints field is an array of objects matching the EntryPointDefinition format. These entries appear both in the Plugins menu in the native menubar, and the plugin panel. Each entry point specifies a type, to create either a direct-action command or a panel show/hide command.\n\n## Manifest Version 5 (Current)\n\nManifest v5 is officially supported since Photoshop 2022 (version 23.3.0), that sports UXP v6.0.2. Developers are allowed to submit Manifest v5 based plugins in the CC Marketplace.(no content)The Manifest v5 introduces a new \"requiredPermissions\" property that includes permissions for launchProcess, network domains, allowCodeGenerationFromStrings, localFileSystem, and clipboard access.\n\n## Example Manifest Structure\n\nA basic manifest includes: manifestVersion, id, name, version, main (pointing to index.html), host configuration (app and minVersion), and entryPoints array (with type, id, and label). The manifestVersion determines what features the plugin may support and requires specific Photoshop versions in order to run.\n\n## Helpful Tools\n\nThe free Validator for UXP extension for Visual Studio Code provides useful syntax validation and suggestions when working with UXP manifests. If you prefer doing things visually, the UXP Developer Tool offers a minimal wizard that partially automates creating plugins and manifests.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"9971410d-fb61-4dfd-8643-3f70b34fcfae","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:52:26.366Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"manifest.json\" UXP plugin required files structure 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01MqtJMWZzb5oeixS6NFTKus","content":[{"title":"Manifest File Structure - UXP Manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/"},{"title":"Plugin manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"The manifest.json file (v4)","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/manifest/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #13 Manifest v5 | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/Adobe-UXP-things-you-need-to-know-manifest-5.html"},{"title":"The manifest.json file (v3)","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/manifest-v3/"},{"title":"Manifest File Structure","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2021/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/"},{"title":"uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/ui-playground/plugin/manifest.json at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/blob/main/ui-playground/plugin/manifest.json"},{"title":"Photoshop Plugins With UXP: Panels & Commands | Francesco's GameDev Corner","url":"https://minifloppy.it/posts/2024/photoshop-plugins-with-uxp-panels-commands/"},{"title":"UXP Manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/1688653963277/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"JSON Schema for manifest.json - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/json-schema-for-manifest-json/698"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about the **manifest.json** file structure for UXP plugins:\n\n## UXP Plugin Manifest.json Overview\n\nThe manifest file is named manifest.json and is required for all plugins.

If present, Vitest will read your root vite.config.ts to match with the plugins and setup as your Vite app. For example, your Vite resolve.alias and plugins configuration will work out-of-the-box.(no content)You have the option to either include the Vitest configuration directly in the vite.config.ts file or create a separate vitest.config.ts file. For better organization and to keep your code tidy, creating a dedicated vitest.config.ts file helps maintain clarity and separation of concerns in your project structure.\n\n### Test File Naming\n\nThe filename must include `.spec` or `.test` for Vitest to recognize it. For example, create test files like `src/tests/app.spec.ts`.\n\n### Jest vs Vitest\n\nTwo of the most popular test runners in the JavaScript and TypeScript ecosystem are Jest and Vitest. Jest, created by Facebook, has long been the de-facto standard for testing JavaScript applications. It's an all-in-one framework that includes a test runner, assertion library, and mocking capabilities.(no content)Vitest is a newer contender that has gained immense popularity, especially within the Vite ecosystem. It's designed to be fast, leveraging Vite's native ESM support for near-instant test runs. It boasts a Jest-compatible API, making the migration from Jest to Vitest relatively straightforward.\n\n### Best Practices for Test Organization\n\n**Arrange, Act, Assert (AAA)**: Structure your tests clearly. First, arrange the setup (create mock data, render components). Then, act by executing the function or simulating a user event. Finally, assert that the outcome is what you expected.(no content)**One Assertion Per Test**: Ideally, each test case should verify a single behavior. This makes it easier to pinpoint the cause of a failure.(no content)**Descriptive Naming**: Use clear, descriptive names for your `describe` and `it` blocks. A good test name should describe the expected behavior, e.g., `it('should return an empty array if no users are found')`.(no content)**Avoid Logic in Tests**: Keep your tests simple and free of conditional logic like `if/else` or loops. Tests should be predictable and straightforward.\n\n### Using describe for Test Suites\n\nUsing `describe` you can define a new suite in the current context, as a set of related tests or benchmarks and other nested suites. A suite lets you organize your tests and benchmarks so reports are more clear.\n\n### Migrating from Jest to Vitest\n\nConverting from Jest to Vitest is straightforward. You simply need to import from Vitest instead of Jest. For example, if you're using Jest instances like `jest.mock` or `jest.spyOn`, you can replace them with `vi.mock` and `vi.spyOn`, respectively.\n\nNote: The search results did not return specific information about UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform) plugin testing.

Main Plugin Logic)\n- **index.ts**: Entry point referenced in manifest.json `main` field\n- **api/**: Functions exposed to webview via Comlink or messaging\n- **commands/**: Handler logic for direct-action menu commands\n- **panels/**: Panel UI components (React/Vue/Svelte)\n- **lib/**: Reusable utilities (BatchPlay wrappers, file I/O, storage)\n- **types/**: TypeScript definitions for Photoshop/UXP APIs\n\n### webview-ui/ (Optional - Separate Frontend Context)\n- Used when building complex UIs with frameworks\n- **components/shared/**: Reusable UI components\n- **components/features/**: Feature-specific components\n- **spectrum/**: Spectrum Web Components imports (require UXP v7.0+, must wrap in `<Theme>`)\n- **hooks/**: Custom hooks for state/side effects\n- Separate `tsconfig.json` for frontend-specific settings\n\n### public/ (Static Assets)\n- **icons/**: Plugin icons in light/dark variants at 1x and 2x sizes (required for marketplace)\n- **assets/**: Images, fonts, other static resources\n\n### tests/ (Test Organization)\n- **unit/**: Component/function unit tests (`*.spec.ts` or `*.test.ts`)\n- **integration/**: Cross-component integration tests\n- **__mocks__/**: Mock data and API stubs\n- Use Vitest (recommended for Vite projects) or Jest\n\n### scripts/ (Build Automation)\n- Custom build, packaging (CCX), and watch scripts\n- CCX packaging creates `.ccx` files (zip format) for distribution\n\n## Configuration Highlights\n\n### TypeScript Setup\n```json\n// tsconfig.json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"typeRoots\": [\n      \"node_modules/@types\",\n      \"node_modules/@adobe/cc-ext-uxp-types\"\n    ],\n    \"lib\": [\"ES2015\"],  // Exclude DOM to avoid conflicts\n    \"target\": \"ES2015\",\n    \"module\": \"ESNext\",\n    \"moduleResolution\": \"node\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Manifest.json (v5 Example)\n```json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"com.company.plugin\",\n  \"name\": \"My Plugin\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\n  \"host\": [\n    {\n      \"app\": \"PS\",\n      \"minVersion\": \"23.3.0\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"entrypoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"mainPanel\",\n      \"label\": \"Main Panel\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"requiredPermissions\": [\n    \"launchProcess\",\n    \"network\",\n    \"localFileSystem\"\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n## Separation of Concerns Patterns\n\n1. **UXP vs Webview**: Keep plugin logic (src/) separate from UI (webview-ui/)\n2. **API Layer**: Isolate host app APIs in dedicated api/ directory\n3. **Components by Feature**: Group related components in features/ subdirectories\n4. **Spectrum Integration**: Centralize SWC imports in spectrum/ directory\n5. **Type Safety**: Maintain all .d.ts files in dedicated types/ folder\n\n## Spectrum Web Components Placement\n- Install individually: `npm install @swc-react/button` (for React)\n- Import in `webview-ui/src/spectrum/`\n- Must wrap all SWC in `<Theme>` component\n- Set `enableSWCSupport: true` in manifest (UXP v7.0+)\n- Use SWC wrappers locked to v0.37.0 (UXP v8.0.0)\n\n## Build & Distribution\n- **Development**: Use Vite with hot-reload or UXP Developer Tool watch mode\n- **Production**: Build to `dist/`, package as `.ccx` via Adobe CLI or custom scripts\n- **Multi-host**: Generate separate CCX per Adobe app (Photoshop, InDesign, XD)\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n- [Adobe XD UXP Folder Structure](https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/folder-structure/)\n- [UXP Manifest v5 Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/)\n- [Spectrum Web Components Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/swc/)\n- [Adobe UXP TypeScript Types](https://github.com/adobe/cc-ext-uxp-types)\n- [Bolt UXP Boilerplate](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp)\n- [UXP Plugin Samples Repository](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples)\n- [Vitest Documentation](https://vitest.dev/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3087,"cache_read_input_tokens":16279,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3087,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWBBn9oRtm9fS2LRbyo4N","type":"assistant","uuid":"90d9a94e-1b25-4cb1-b5f2-d253c1e7c407","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:53:19.482Z"}
