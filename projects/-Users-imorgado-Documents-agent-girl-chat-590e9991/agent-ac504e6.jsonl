This will create a configuration file, optionally add examples, a GitHub Action workflow and a first test example.spec.ts.(no content)Execute `npm init playwright@latest` to begin the Playwright installation process. Select TypeScript when prompted. Enter the name of the folder to place your tests, or leave it for the default name (tests).\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nPlaywright relies on Node.js for installation and execution. Make sure you have the latest stable version of Node.js installed on your machine. A package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn will be needed to install Playwright.(no content)Use Visual Studio Code for optimal Playwright and TypeScript integration.\n\n### Project Structure\n\nAfter installation is complete, your project structure will look like this:\n```\nplaywright-automation-ts/\n├── node_modules/\n├── package.json\n├── package-lock.json\n├── playwright.config.ts\n├── tests/\n│   └── example.spec.ts\n├── tests-examples/\n│   └── demo-todo-app.spec.ts\n└── tsconfig.json\n```\n\n### TypeScript Support\n\nPlaywright supports TypeScript out of the box. You just write tests in TypeScript, and Playwright will read them, transform to JavaScript and run. Note that Playwright does not check the types and will run tests even if there are non-critical TypeScript compilation errors.(no content)Playwright only supports the following tsconfig options: allowJs, baseUrl, paths and references. It's recommended to set up a separate tsconfig.json in the tests directory so that you can change some preferences specifically for the tests.\n\n### Configuration File (playwright.config.ts)\n\nThe playwright.config centralizes configuration: target browsers, timeouts, retries, projects, reporters and more.(no content)Define multiple browser projects (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) in the projects array for cross-browser testing:\n```typescript\nprojects: [\n  { name: 'chromium', use: { browserName: 'chromium' } },\n  { name: 'firefox', use: { browserName: 'firefox' } },\n  { name: 'webkit', use: { browserName: 'webkit' } }\n]\n```\n\n### Installing Browsers\n\nYou will also need to install browsers - either manually or by adding a package that will do it for you automatically. Download Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browsers with: `npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit`\n\n### TypeScript Configuration (tsconfig.json)\n\nSet the target option to ES2020 in tsconfig.json to leverage modern JavaScript capabilities. Use \"moduleResolution\": \"node\" to ensure correct module imports. Configure \"baseUrl\" and \"paths\" for cleaner, alias-based imports in large test suites.(no content)Playwright supports path mapping declared in the tsconfig.json. Make sure that baseUrl is also set.

This will create a configuration file, optionally add examples, a GitHub Action workflow and a first test example.spec.ts.(no content)Execute `npm init playwright@latest` to begin the Playwright installation process. Select TypeScript when prompted. Enter the name of the folder to place your tests, or leave it for the default name (tests).\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nPlaywright relies on Node.js for installation and execution. Make sure you have the latest stable version of Node.js installed on your machine. A package manager like npm (Node Package Manager) or Yarn will be needed to install Playwright.(no content)Use Visual Studio Code for optimal Playwright and TypeScript integration.\n\n### Project Structure\n\nAfter installation is complete, your project structure will look like this:\n```\nplaywright-automation-ts/\n├── node_modules/\n├── package.json\n├── package-lock.json\n├── playwright.config.ts\n├── tests/\n│   └── example.spec.ts\n├── tests-examples/\n│   └── demo-todo-app.spec.ts\n└── tsconfig.json\n```\n\n### TypeScript Support\n\nPlaywright supports TypeScript out of the box. You just write tests in TypeScript, and Playwright will read them, transform to JavaScript and run. Note that Playwright does not check the types and will run tests even if there are non-critical TypeScript compilation errors.(no content)Playwright only supports the following tsconfig options: allowJs, baseUrl, paths and references. It's recommended to set up a separate tsconfig.json in the tests directory so that you can change some preferences specifically for the tests.\n\n### Configuration File (playwright.config.ts)\n\nThe playwright.config centralizes configuration: target browsers, timeouts, retries, projects, reporters and more.(no content)Define multiple browser projects (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) in the projects array for cross-browser testing:\n```typescript\nprojects: [\n  { name: 'chromium', use: { browserName: 'chromium' } },\n  { name: 'firefox', use: { browserName: 'firefox' } },\n  { name: 'webkit', use: { browserName: 'webkit' } }\n]\n```\n\n### Installing Browsers\n\nYou will also need to install browsers - either manually or by adding a package that will do it for you automatically. Download Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browsers with: `npx playwright install chromium firefox webkit`\n\n### TypeScript Configuration (tsconfig.json)\n\nSet the target option to ES2020 in tsconfig.json to leverage modern JavaScript capabilities. Use \"moduleResolution\": \"node\" to ensure correct module imports. Configure \"baseUrl\" and \"paths\" for cleaner, alias-based imports in large test suites.(no content)Playwright supports path mapping declared in the tsconfig.json. Make sure that baseUrl is also set. Here is an example tsconfig.json that works with Playwright:\n```json\n{\n  \"compilerOptions\": {\n    \"baseUrl\": \".\",\n    \"paths\": {\n      \"@myhelper/*\": [\"packages/myhelper/*\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Running Tests\n\nBy default tests run headless in parallel across Chromium, Firefox and WebKit (configurable in playwright.config).(no content)Run a single project/browser: `--project=chromium`. Run one file: `npx playwright test tests/example.spec.ts`. Open testing UI: `--ui`."],"durationSeconds":23.328643}}

Both headed and headless browsers are subject to this change.(no content)The team expects no functional changes from this switch - the biggest change is the new icon and title in your toolbar.(no content)On Arm64 Linux, Playwright continues to use Chromium.\n\n### Removed APIs\nAfter 3 years of being deprecated, `Page.Accessibility` has been removed from the API. Users should use other libraries such as Axe if they need to test page accessibility.\n\n### Docker Image Changes\nThe `:latest/:focal/:jammy` tag for Playwright Docker images is no longer being published. Users should pin to a specific version for better stability and reproducibility.\n\n### Platform Deprecations\n- There will be no more updates for WebKit on Ubuntu 20.04 and Debian 11. It's recommended to update your OS to a later version.\n- macOS 13 is now deprecated and will no longer receive WebKit updates. Users should upgrade to a more recent macOS version.\n- The `@playwright/experimental-ct-vue2` package will no longer be updated.\n- The `@playwright/experimental-ct-solid` package will no longer be updated.\n\n### API Deprecations\nThe `no_wait_after` option in `locator.select_option()` was deprecated.\n\n### Headless Mode Changes (v1.49)\nIf you're using certain channels, after updating to Playwright v1.49 your tests may require snapshot updates and adaptation of test code around PDF viewers and extensions.\n\n## New Features in 2025\n\n### Playwright Agents\nPlaywright introduced Playwright Agents - three custom agent definitions designed to guide LLMs through building Playwright tests: a planner that explores the app and produces a Markdown test plan, a generator that transforms the plan into Playwright Test files, and a healer that executes tests and automatically repairs failing ones.\n\n### Service Worker Support\nNetwork requests issued by Service Workers are now reported and can be routed through the BrowserContext (Chromium only). You can opt out using the `PLAYWRIGHT_DISABLE_SERVICE_WORKER_NETWORK` environment variable.\n\n### WebServer Wait Field\n`testConfig.webServer` added a `wait` field where you can pass a regular expression, and Playwright will wait until the webserver logs match it.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"1aae5252-033c-4612-9716-038d407f81ef","timestamp":"2025-12-16T22:51:45.353Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Playwright latest version breaking changes 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_018T7Yfw8KbwHjbUUUMPcLdr","content":[{"title":"Releases · microsoft/playwright","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/releases"},{"title":"Release notes | Playwright","url":"https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes"},{"title":"Changelog | Applitools Documentation","url":"https://applitools.com/docs/eyes/sdks/playwright-ts-standard/changelog"},{"title":"Release notes | Playwright .NET","url":"https://playwright.dev/dotnet/docs/release-notes"},{"title":"Release notes | Playwright Python","url":"https://playwright.dev/python/docs/release-notes"},{"title":"playwright · PyPI","url":"https://pypi.org/project/playwright/"},{"title":"Release notes | Playwright Java","url":"https://playwright.dev/java/docs/release-notes"},{"title":"Releases · microsoft/playwright-dotnet","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-dotnet/releases"},{"title":"Release Notes | Playwright MCP Server","url":"https://executeautomation.github.io/mcp-playwright/docs/release"},{"title":"Releases · microsoft/playwright-python","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-python/releases"}]},"Here are the latest breaking changes and updates for Playwright in 2025:\n\n## Latest Version\n\nThe latest version of Playwright is **1.57.0**, released on December 9, 2025.\n\n## Major Breaking Changes in 2025\n\n### Playwright 1.57 - Chrome for Testing Switch\nStarting with Playwright 1.57, Playwright switches from Chromium to using Chrome for Testing builds.
