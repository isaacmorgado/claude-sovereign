Validating credential scope during API requests\n2. Checking client identity headers\n3. Rejecting OAuth tokens that have the restricted scope\n4. Returning a 400 error with the scope restriction message\n\nOpenCode attempted workarounds by shifting tool prefixes from `oc_` to `mcp_` in header identifiers, indicating the blocking mechanism relies on pattern matching in request metadata.\n\n### Sources:\n- [Anthropic's Walled Garden: The Claude Code Crackdown](https://paddo.dev/blog/anthropic-walled-garden-crackdown/)\n- [Anthropic Just Blocked Claude Code Subscriptions Outside Its Own App](https://ai-checker.webcoda.com.au/articles/anthropic-blocks-claude-code-subscriptions-third-party-tools-2026)\n- [Anthropic cracks down on unauthorized Claude usage by third-party harnesses and rivals](https://venturebeat.com/technology/anthropic-cracks-down-on-unauthorized-claude-usage-by-third-party-harnesses)\n- [Anthropic Blocks Claude Code in Third-Party Tools Like OpenCode](https://www.tamiltech.in/article/anthropic-blocks-claude-code-access-third-party-tools-opencode)\n- [Anthropic blocks third-party use of Claude Code subscriptions - Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46549823)\n- [Claude Code GitHub Issue #12021](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/12021)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2050,"cache_read_input_tokens":36759,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2050,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":5,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CX5x6vmwnDuRhYMuDeEjA","type":"assistant","uuid":"97f8904d-a22e-465f-b1de-7fb3ee6d434c","timestamp":"2026-01-13T19:44:52.347Z"}
