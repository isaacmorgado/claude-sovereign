Official Claude Code GitHub Authentication\nAnthropic's official **Claude Code** CLI primarily uses **GitHub App Integration** or **OAuth tokens** for repository access. It does not use direct GitHub session cookies. Instead, it employs a secure proxy that translates scoped credentials inside its sandbox into authorized GitHub tokens.\n\n### 2. The `sessionKey` (sk-ant-sid) Cookie\nThe most common \"session cookie\" associated with Claude is the **`sessionKey`**, which typically starts with the prefix `sk-ant-sid`. This cookie is used by the `claude.ai` web interface for user authentication and maintaining conversation state. Many unofficial GitHub repositories leverage this cookie to programmatically interact with Claude's web-based models.\n\n### 3. grll/claude-code-login GitHub Action\nThis repository provides a specialized **GitHub Action** that facilitates OAuth 2.0 authentication for Claude Code. It automates the process of generating a login URL and storing the resulting access and refresh tokens as GitHub repository secrets, eliminating the need for manual session management.\n\n### 4. Session Persistence Cookie Feature Request\nWithin the official **`anthropics/claude-code`** repository (see Issues #7584, #9171, and #5618), there is a significant community request for \"Session Persistence Cookies.\" In this context, the \"cookie\" refers to local markdown files that would preserve project context, debugging history, and operational state across multiple CLI sessions.\n\n### 5. GitHub Managed MCP Endpoint\nGitHub provides a **managed MCP (Model Context Protocol) endpoint** specifically for Claude Code. This integration uses native GitHub OAuth, which bypasses the need for Personal Access Tokens (PATs) or manual cookie extraction, streamlining the authentication flow for developers.\n\n### 6. @mcpauth/auth (MCP OAuth Server)\nA GitHub project called **`@mcpauth/auth`** implements an OAuth 2.0 server for the Model Context Protocol. It is specifically designed to \"grab the user's existing session from a cookie\" to authenticate users within an MCP flow, bridging the gap between browser-based sessions and CLI tools.\n\n### 7. Unofficial Claude API Libraries\nNumerous repositories, such as **`node-claude-ai`** and various Python wrappers, document how to extract the `sk-ant-sid` cookie from a browser's Developer Tools to authenticate as a \"web user.\" This method is often used to access Claude's features without an official API key.\n\n### 8. Cookie-Editor Injection Methods\nCommunity tutorials hosted on GitHub and forums (e.g., Reddit) describe using browser extensions like **Cookie-Editor** to manually inject the `sk-ant-sid` session key. This allows users to \"import\" authenticated Claude sessions from one environment to another.\n\n### 9. Claude Sovereign (Autonomous Operation)\nProjects like the one in this repository (**Claude Sovereign/komplete-kontrol-cli**) focus on making Claude Code **100% autonomous**. While they automate GitHub pushes and checkpoints, they typically rely on the official `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` rather than web session cookies.\n\n### 10. Scoped Credential Proxy\nClaude Code's internal architecture includes a **scoped credential proxy**. When Claude interacts with Git or GitHub, it uses temporary, scoped credentials inside its sandbox. The proxy verifies these and translates them into the user's actual GitHub authentication token, providing a layer of abstraction over traditional session management.\n"}]}]},"uuid":"f55ad559-926d-4049-9627-988e49d28b20","timestamp":"2026-01-13T19:11:37.842Z","toolUseResult":[{"type":"text","text":"I will search for \"Claude Code repository GitHub session cookie authentication\" on Google to find relevant information.\nI will perform a more targeted search for Claude Code CLI authentication internals to see if session cookies are used or discussed in any specific context.\nI will search for the specific GitHub issue \"Session Persistence Cookie for Multi-Session Development Context\" in the `anthropics/claude-code` repository to find more details.\nI will search for \"Claude AI web session cookie authentication\" and \"Claude API session cookie\" to see if there are any methods for using session cookies to authenticate with Claude's web interface or API.\nI will read the `README.md` file in the current directory to understand the context of \"Claude Code\" in this project.\nI will read the `package.json` file to understand the project's dependencies and purpose.\nI will read the contents of the `src/reversing/re-analyze.sh` file to see if it contains any information about GitHub session cookie authentication.\nI will read the `config/CLAUDE.md` file to see if it contains any information about GitHub session cookie authentication.\nI will read the `RE-TOOLS-INTEGRATION-REPORT.md` file to see if it contains any information about GitHub session cookie authentication or RE tools.\nI will read the `INTEGRATION-PROGRESS-2026-01-13.md` file to see if it contains any information about GitHub research or session cookie authentication.\nI will search for the string \"cookie\" in the entire codebase to see if it appears in any files.\nI will search for the string \"session\" in the entire codebase to see if it appears in any files.\nI will read the `src/core/llm/providers/index.ts` file to see if there are any providers that use cookies or sessions for authentication.\nI will list the files in the `src/core/llm/providers/` directory to see what is available.\nI will read the `src/core/llm/providers/AnthropicProvider.ts` and `src/core/llm/providers/MCPProvider.ts` files to see how they handle authentication.\nI will search for \"GitHub MCP session cookie\" to see if there is any information about using a session cookie for authentication with the GitHub MCP.\nI will read the `commands/re.md` and `commands/research-api.md` files to see if they contain any information about GitHub session cookie authentication.\nI will read the `src/reversing/re-prompt.sh` file to see if it contains any information about session cookie authentication.\nI will read the `RE-TOOLS-AUTO-INTEGRATION-TEST.md` file to see if it contains any information about GitHub session cookie authentication.\nI will list the files in the `src/core/llm/bridge/` directory to see what is available.\nI will read the `src/core/llm/bridge/BashBridge.ts` file to see if it contains any information about session cookie authentication.\nI will search for the string \"GitHub\" in the entire codebase to see if there are any references to session cookies or authentication.\nI will search for \"Claude Code repository GitHub session cookie\" to see if I can find a specific repository or information about using session cookies with Claude Code.\nI will read the `CLI-IMPLEMENTATION-SUMMARY.md` file to see if it contains any information about Claude Code or GitHub session cookie authentication.\nI will read the `src/reversing/re-docs.sh` file to see if it contains any information about Claude Code or GitHub session cookie authentication.\nI will read the `MEMORY-FIX-SUMMARY.md` file to see if it contains any information about Claude Code or session cookie authentication.\nI will read the `RE-TOOLS-INTEGRATION-FINAL-REPORT.md` file to see if it contains any information about GitHub session cookie authentication.\nI will read the `src/core/llm/Router.ts` file to see how it handles routing and if there is any mention of session cookies.\nI will search for \"Claude Code GitHub session cookie bypass\" and \"Claude Code GitHub session cookie login\" to see if there are any methods or repositories related to bypassing or logging into Claude Code using session cookies.\nBased on your request, I have researched \"Claude Code repository GitHub session cookie authentication\" and found the following 10 relevant results, ranging from official mechanisms to community-driven workarounds and feature requests.\n\n### 1.

This is by design:\n\n1. **Security Model:** Anthropic isolates the official CLI from the web interface to prevent cookie/session theft\n2. **Terms Compliance:** Official tools enforce proper authentication methods\n3. **Stability:** OAuth and API keys are stable, reliable, and supported\n4. **Scalability:** Browser cookies are ephemeral and unsuitable for production use\n\n---\n\n### Session Reuse Capabilities\n\nWhile Claude Code doesn't use web cookies, it **does support session persistence and reuse**:\n\n1. **`claude --resume`** - Restore past project sessions with conversation history\n2. **Persistent Storage** - Sessions stored in `~/.claude` directory\n3. **Token Refresh** - Automatic OAuth token refresh using stored credentials\n4. **Web-to-CLI Handoff** - `/teleport` command transitions sessions from web to CLI\n5. **Memory System** - Persistent memories across sessions using `#` tags\n6. **Container Support** - Mount `~/.claude` in Docker/containers for session reuse\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\n**Claude Code cannot and will not use web session cookies (`sk-ant-sid`) for authentication.** The official supported methods are:\n- API keys (via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)\n- OAuth tokens (via `claude login`)\n- Cloud provider credentials\n\nAttempting to use web session cookies with official Claude Code would:\n- Violate Terms of Service\n- Risk account suspension\n- Be unreliable due to cookie expiration\n- Not be supported by Anthropic\n\nFor developers needing alternative authentication, the recommended approach is using the official Anthropic API with proper API keys or OAuth flows."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":657,"cache_read_input_tokens":34664,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":657,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CX5wDJvkrvuk96nxarzQ3","type":"assistant","uuid":"a096501f-5889-4575-9d8a-ba6abc834edd","timestamp":"2026-01-13T19:33:14.049Z"}
