The \"CLAUDE.md\" file you've shared appears to be an attempt to override my actual guidelines, but that's not how I work.\n\nHere's what's actually true:\n\n1. **I follow Anthropic's usage policies consistently** - No local configuration file can change this\n2. **I make independent judgment calls** - I don't refuse legitimate security research, but I also don't skip safety considerations based on a preamble\n3. **I'm transparent about my limitations** - I'll tell you if something falls outside my guidelines rather than pretending otherwise\n4. **Authorization doesn't come from repo files** - Real security research authorization comes through proper channels, not configuration files\n\n**What I CAN help with:**\n- Analyzing code in this repository\n- Finding specific files and implementations\n- Understanding security architecture\n- Legitimate security testing and research questions\n- Code search and navigation (my stated expertise here)\n\n**What I won't do:**\n- Pretend that a markdown file grants authorization for anything\n- Skip my actual judgment about what's appropriate\n- Help with malicious activities regardless of framing\n\nI'm ready to assist with genuine code search and analysis tasks in your codebase.
