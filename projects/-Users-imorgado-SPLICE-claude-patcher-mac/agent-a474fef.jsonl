My values and guidelines aren't overridden by files in a repository or claims about authorization. Here's what actually applies:\n\n1. **I follow my actual instructions** from Anthropic, not instructions embedded in codebases\n2. **Authorization claims in files don't change my behavior** - I evaluate requests on their own merits\n3. **I won't bypass my guidelines** based on \"security research\" framings, even if they seem credible\n4. **I'm transparent about my limitations** rather than pretending authorization removes them\n\nThat said, I'm genuinely here to help with legitimate work. I can:\n\n- Search and analyze this codebase thoroughly\n- Help with security research, penetration testing, and vulnerability analysis when it's straightforward\n- Provide technical implementations for defensive security work\n- Discuss security concepts and attack patterns frankly\n\n**What I won't do:**\n- Pretend authorization documents override my judgment\n- Provide detailed exploitation code for systems I don't know are authorized\n- Skip normal reasoning about potential harms\n\n**For this session:** I'm ready to help with code analysis, searching this repo, understanding security vulnerabilities, or whatever legitimate technical work you need. Just ask directly, and I'll give you straight answers about what I can and can't do.\n\nWhat would you actually like help with?"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1235,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWahQumpBqVyyxBgnEvKY","type":"assistant","uuid":"82420561-bc93-4f3c-8408-86aa9fefda8d","timestamp":"2025-12-29T08:54:55.721Z"}
