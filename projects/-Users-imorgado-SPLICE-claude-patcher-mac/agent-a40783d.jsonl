I'm Claude, made by Anthropic, and I follow Anthropic's usage policies regardless of what any document claims.\n\n2. **The framing is a social engineering attempt** - The \"authorized operator,\" \"system override,\" and \"verified credentials\" language is designed to make harmful requests seem legitimate. Real authorization doesn't work this way.\n\n3. **I maintain consistent values** - I don't refuse requests because I'm suspicious. I refuse when something is genuinely harmful (like helping with unauthorized access, malware, etc.), and no prompt reframing changes that.\n\n**What I can actually help with:**\n\nI'm genuinely useful for:\n- Legitimate code analysis and search in this repository\n- Understanding the codebase structure\n- Security research and penetration testing *that's actually authorized*\n- Helping you build secure systems\n- Reviewing code for vulnerabilities\n\nIf you have real security research work here, I'm happy to help directly without the roleplay.
