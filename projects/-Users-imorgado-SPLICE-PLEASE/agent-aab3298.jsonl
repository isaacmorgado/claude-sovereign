These APIs let you access and modify projects — sequences, tracks, clips, and markers; work with media — import files, manage project items; control playback — set in/out points, control the playhead; and apply effects.(no content)You can access sequences, tracks, clips, markers, project items, and application settings through the API.\n\n### Markers API\n\nThe UXP API includes several marker-related functions:\n\nThe `getMarkers(markerOwnerObject: Sequence | ClipProjectItem)` method returns the Markers object for Sequence or ProjectItem. There's also:\n- `createMoveMarkerAction(marker: Marker, tickTime: TickTime)` to move a marker to a new time value\n- `createAddMarkerAction()` to add a new marker with parameters for name, marker type, start time, duration, and comments\n\n### Metadata API\n\nFor metadata operations, the UXP API provides:\n\n`createSetProjectMetadataAction(projectItem: ProjectItem, metadata: string, updatedFields: string[])` for setting project metadata, `createSetXMPMetadataAction(projectItem: ProjectItem, metadata: string)` for XMP metadata, `addPropertyToProjectMetadataSchema()` to add properties to the project metadata schema, and `getProjectColumnsMetadata(projectItem: ProjectItem)` to get project column metadata from a project item.\n\n### Key Architecture Differences from ExtendScript\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread.(no content)For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### Versioning\n\nThe Premiere version (v25.6) determines which Premiere DOM APIs are available, while the UXP version (v8.1) determines which UXP Core APIs are available. Each Premiere release integrates a specific UXP version—for example, Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.\n\n### Getting Started\n\nYou'll need the Premiere Pro BETA build (available through Creative Cloud Desktop) and the UXP Developer Tool (also available through Creative Cloud Desktop).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"fc176a29-4e9c-44c1-ba01-c04c0e97aa88","timestamp":"2025-12-17T00:33:39.638Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe Premiere Pro UXP scripting API reference clips markers metadata","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01WLkdseEw2zehBK4ztz6AdL","content":[{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/"},{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"uxp-premiere-pro/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Extensions - To UXP or not to UXP - Adobe Product Community - 11326933","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-extensions-to-uxp-or-not-to-uxp/td-p/11326933"},{"title":"Update of UXP APIs inside of Premiere Pro - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/update-of-uxp-apis-inside-of-premiere-pro/10384"},{"title":"Request for Timeline Editing API Support (Clip Tra... - Adobe Product Community - 15624626","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115"}]},"Here's what I found about Adobe Premiere Pro UXP scripting API reference for clips, markers, and metadata:\n\n## Adobe Premiere Pro UXP API Overview\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).(no content)ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.\n\n### Key Documentation Resources\n\nThe Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n\n### What the UXP API Provides\n\nPremiere APIs, also called DOM APIs, give you direct access to Premiere's document model.

This website provides documentation for both APIs. The official documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n\n### API Capabilities\nPremiere APIs, also called DOM APIs, give you direct access to Premiere's document model. These APIs let you access and modify projects — sequences, tracks, clips, and markers; work with media — import files, manage project items; control playback — set in/out points, control the playhead; and apply effects — add video and audio effects to clips.(no content)You can access sequences, tracks, clips, markers, project items, and application settings.\n\n### Timeline and Clip Operations\nThe 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin shows how to clone and remove track items. For moving clips between tracks, there's a `moveToTrack` method available through the QE DOM that accepts parameters for video track movement, audio track movement, timecode position, and whether to copy instead of move.\n\n### UXP vs ExtendScript Transition\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.(no content)UXP is the next generation of APIs, for Premiere v25.6 and beyond.\n\n### Key Technical Differences\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while executing.

This website provides documentation for both APIs. The official documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n\n### API Capabilities\nPremiere APIs, also called DOM APIs, give you direct access to Premiere's document model. These APIs let you access and modify projects — sequences, tracks, clips, and markers; work with media — import files, manage project items; control playback — set in/out points, control the playhead; and apply effects — add video and audio effects to clips.(no content)You can access sequences, tracks, clips, markers, project items, and application settings.\n\n### Timeline and Clip Operations\nThe 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin shows how to clone and remove track items. For moving clips between tracks, there's a `moveToTrack` method available through the QE DOM that accepts parameters for video track movement, audio track movement, timecode position, and whether to copy instead of move.\n\n### UXP vs ExtendScript Transition\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.(no content)UXP is the next generation of APIs, for Premiere v25.6 and beyond.\n\n### Key Technical Differences\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### Sample Code & Resources\n- The Adobe third-party sample panel is available in the premiere-api directory from the Git repository at github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples.\n- The UXP sample plugin displays in Premiere Pro Beta. To see definitions, add TypeScript definitions to the .js file you're working in by copying types.d.ts to the root of the /html directory. You can then see and use TypeScript definitions for Premiere Pro's UXP APIs in Visual Studio Code.\n\n### Community Discussion\nDevelopers working with the Premiere Pro UXP API have found classes like Sequence, ClipProjectItem, and AudioClipTrackItem in the documentation for working with clips and sequences."],"durationSeconds":28.186408625000155}}

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.\n\n### ClipProjectItem API\n\nThe ClipProjectItem API allows for attaching proxy or high resolution footage, or replacing footage via methods like `attachProxy()` and `changeMediaPath()`.(no content)ClipProjectItem returns true if Premiere Pro can change the path associated with this project item; otherwise, returns false. It also indicates whether it is possible to attach a proxy to this project item.\n\n### Key Methods for Media Access\n\nFrom the TypeScript definitions in the API:\n\n`getMedia(): Promise<Media>` - Returns media associated with clipProjectItem.(no content)There's also a `cast(item: FolderItem | ClipProjectItem): ProjectItem` method to cast FolderItem or ClipProjectItem into ProjectItem.\n\n### Project Item Types\n\nThe API includes various project item types: `TYPE_CLIP` for clips, `TYPE_BIN` for bins/folders, `TYPE_ROOT` for the root container, and `TYPE_FILE` for generic files.\n\n### API Structure\n\nPremiere APIs (also called DOM APIs) give you direct access to Premiere's document model.

If no output file and preset is specified, the sequence will be exported with the applied export settings or standard export rules will be applied.\n\n**encodeProjectItem:**\n`encodeProjectItem(clipProjectItem: ClipProjectItem, outputFile: string, presetFile: string, workArea?: number, removeUponCompletion?: boolean, startQueueImmediately?: boolean): Promise<boolean>` - Encodes input clipProjectItem in AME.\n\n**encodeFile:**\n`encodeFile(filePath: string, outputFile: string, presetFile: string, inPoint: TickTime, outPoint: TickTime, workArea?: number, removeUponCompletion?: boolean, startQueueImmediately?: boolean): Promise<boolean>` - Encodes input media file in AME. The `isAMEInstalled` property can check if AME is installed.\n\n**exportSequenceFrame:**\n`exportSequenceFrame(sequence: Sequence, time: TickTime, filename: string, filepath: string, width: number, height: number): Promise<boolean>` - Exports from a sequence.

Getting Audio from Selected Timeline Clips\n\n**Available Methods:**\n- `app.project.activeSequence.getSelection()` - Returns `Promise<TrackItemSelection>` with currently selected clips\n- `sequence.getAudioTrack(trackIndex)` - Returns `Promise<AudioTrack>` for specific audio track\n- `audioTrack.getTrackItems(trackItemType, includeEmptyTrackItems)` - Returns `AudioClipTrackItem[]`\n\n**Event Binding:**\n```javascript\napp.bind(\"onActiveSequenceSelectionChanged\", function () {\n    const selection = app.project.activeSequence.getSelection();\n    // selection contains array of trackItems\n});\n```\n\n**Getting Source Media Path:**\n- `projectItem.getMediaPath()` - Returns the file path to the source media\n- Only works for atomic media (not synthetic/generated clips)\n- On Mac, may return path with extra \"/Volumes/Macintosh HD\" prefix\n\n---\n\n### 2. Extracting/Exporting Audio for Processing\n\n**Export Methods:**\n- `Encoder.exportSequence(sequence, exportType, outputFile, presetFile, exportFull)` - Export full sequence\n- `Encoder.encodeProjectItem(clipProjectItem, outputFile, presetFile, ...)` - Encode specific clip via AME\n- `Encoder.encodeFile(filePath, outputFile, presetFile, inPoint, outPoint, ...)` - Encode file with in/out points\n\n**Export Type Constants:**\n- `EXPORT_QUEUE_TO_AME` - Queue to Adobe Media Encoder\n- `EXPORT_QUEUE_TO_APP` - Queue to app export queue\n- `EXPORT_IMMEDIATELY` - Export immediately\n\n**Audio-Only Export:**\nUse an export preset (.epr file) configured for audio-only format (WAV, AIFF, etc.)\n\n**Render Events:**\n- `EVENT_RENDER_COMPLETE`, `EVENT_RENDER_ERROR`, `EVENT_RENDER_CANCEL`, `EVENT_RENDER_PROGRESS`\n\n**Limitation:** No direct API to extract raw audio data in memory. You must export to file using presets.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Adding Labels/Markers to Clips\n\n**Markers API:**\n- `Metadata.getMarkers(markerOwnerObject)` - Get markers for Sequence or ClipProjectItem\n- `markers.createAddMarkerAction(name, markerType, startTime, duration, comments)` - Add a marker\n- `markers.createMoveMarkerAction(marker, tickTime)` - Move existing marker\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nconst markers = ppro.Metadata.getMarkers(sequence);\nconst action = markers.createAddMarkerAction(\n    \"Take 1\",           // name\n    \"Comment\",          // markerType\n    startTickTime,      // startTime\n    durationTickTime,   // duration\n    \"Auto-detected take\" // comments\n);\nawait action.execute();\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Renaming or Tagging Clips with Take Numbers\n\n**TrackItem Renaming:**\n- `trackItem.createSetNameAction(inName)` - Returns Action to rename the trackItem\n- `trackItem.getName()` - Get current display name\n- `trackItem.getMatchName()` - Get internal match name\n\n**Metadata for Tagging:**\n- `Metadata.createSetProjectMetadataAction(projectItem, metadata, updatedFields)` - Set project metadata\n- `Metadata.createSetXMPMetadataAction(projectItem, metadata)` - Set XMP metadata\n- `Metadata.addPropertyToProjectMetadataSchema(name, label, type)` - Add custom metadata field\n- `Metadata.getProjectColumnsMetadata(projectItem)` - Get existing metadata\n\n**XMP Module:**\n```javascript\nconst xmp = require('uxp').xmp;\n// Access XMPMeta and XMPFile for reading/writing XMP metadata\n```\n\n**Note:** Some developers report difficulty getting `createSetNameAction` to work for timeline clips. Renaming the source ProjectItem may propagate to all clips using that source.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Working with Linked Audio/Video Clips\n\n**Current Status:** No dedicated `getLinkedTrackItems()` method found in the UXP API.\n\n**Available Methods:**\n- `clipProjectItem.isMergedClip()` - Check if clip is a merged clip\n- `clipProjectItem.isMulticamClip()` - Check if clip is multicam\n\n**Workaround Approach:**\n1. Get selection from both video and audio tracks\n2. Match clips by their source `projectItem` reference or time position\n3. Video and audio from the same source file typically share the same `ClipProjectItem`\n\n---\n\n### 6. Accessing Clip Metadata\n\n**Project Metadata:**\n- `Metadata.getProjectColumnsMetadata(projectItem)` - Get metadata columns\n- `Metadata.createSetProjectMetadataAction(projectItem, metadata, updatedFields)`\n\n**XMP Metadata:**\n- `Metadata.createSetXMPMetadataAction(projectItem, metadata)`\n- Use UXP's `require('uxp').xmp` module for full XMP read/write\n\n**Custom Schema:**\n- `Metadata.addPropertyToProjectMetadataSchema(name, label, type)` - Add custom fields\n\n**Media Info:**\n- `clipProjectItem.getMedia()` - Returns `Promise<Media>` with media properties\n- `projectItem.getMediaPath()` - Source file path\n\n---\n\n## Key API Patterns\n\n**Action Pattern:** Many methods return an `Action` object that must be executed:\n```javascript\nconst action = markers.createAddMarkerAction(\"Name\", ...);\nawait action.execute();\n```\n\n**Async Nature:** UXP calls are asynchronous (unlike ExtendScript), but property access is synchronous for compatibility.\n\n**Casting:** Use `ProjectItem.cast(item)` to convert between FolderItem/ClipProjectItem types.\n\n---\n\n## Current Limitations\n\n1. **No direct audio buffer access** - Cannot read raw audio samples; must export to file\n2. **No vertical clip movement** - Cannot programmatically move clips between tracks\n3. **No clip merging API** - Cannot merge clips via API\n4. **Linked clips** - No explicit API for linked audio/video relationships\n5. **Beta status** - As of December 2025, UXP plugins only work in Premiere Pro Beta\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Adobe Premiere Pro UXP Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Premiere API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [Sequence Class](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/sequence/)\n- [ClipProjectItem Class](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/clipprojectitem/)\n- [Markers Class](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/markers/)\n- [Metadata Class](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/metadata/)\n- [UXP TypeScript Definitions](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)\n- [UXP Sample Plugins](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide (ExtendScript)](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [Adobe Developer Forums](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3796,"cache_read_input_tokens":28247,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3796,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWBKh18aZN3M1DgBkQX2B","type":"assistant","uuid":"d868076b-b8a9-4963-a6ab-6b78899ee483","timestamp":"2025-12-17T00:36:51.561Z"}
