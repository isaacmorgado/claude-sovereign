The system performs retrieval of similar speech, which was already clustered into groups based on the spoken content.(no content)None of the traditional algorithms are tailored specifically for speech retrieval. Although similarities exist, speech differs from music, requiring special attention for audio fingerprinting.(no content)The decision was made to use Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS). Faiss scales incredibly well, it provides a lot of functionality and different indexes used for searching the database.\n\n### Fingerprinting for Repeated Sound Events\n\nAn exhaustive search approach for repeating events in a thirty-minute recording shows the histogram of common hashes between each 2-second window. Hash hit counts are represented in log-scaled intensity.\n\n### Core Fingerprinting Techniques\n\nAcoustic fingerprinting is a different approach with much lower computational complexity than speech recognition. The algorithm splits an audio file into many, very short segments and produces a characteristic fingerprint (a set of mathematical features) for each segment. The features are based on a frequency spectrum analysis, and are chosen such that they are robust against distortions.(no content)Practically all audio fingerprints are based on features in a spectrogram. A spectrogram is an approximate decomposition of the signal over time and frequency. It is created by taking a short window of time of the signal, and then performing a Fourier transform that decomposes that window over its frequencies.\n\n### Speech Analysis Applications\n\nBeyond environmental sounds, audio fingerprinting is equally effective in speech analysis. Investigators can track key phrases, witness testimonies, or criminal confessions within extensive phone call recordings, interrogation tapes, or public speeches.

The system performs retrieval of similar speech, which was already clustered into groups based on the spoken content.(no content)None of the traditional algorithms are tailored specifically for speech retrieval. Although similarities exist, speech differs from music, requiring special attention for audio fingerprinting.(no content)The decision was made to use Facebook AI Similarity Search (FAISS). Faiss scales incredibly well, it provides a lot of functionality and different indexes used for searching the database.\n\n### Fingerprinting for Repeated Sound Events\n\nAn exhaustive search approach for repeating events in a thirty-minute recording shows the histogram of common hashes between each 2-second window. Hash hit counts are represented in log-scaled intensity.\n\n### Core Fingerprinting Techniques\n\nAcoustic fingerprinting is a different approach with much lower computational complexity than speech recognition. The algorithm splits an audio file into many, very short segments and produces a characteristic fingerprint (a set of mathematical features) for each segment. The features are based on a frequency spectrum analysis, and are chosen such that they are robust against distortions.(no content)Practically all audio fingerprints are based on features in a spectrogram. A spectrogram is an approximate decomposition of the signal over time and frequency. It is created by taking a short window of time of the signal, and then performing a Fourier transform that decomposes that window over its frequencies.\n\n### Speech Analysis Applications\n\nBeyond environmental sounds, audio fingerprinting is equally effective in speech analysis. Investigators can track key phrases, witness testimonies, or criminal confessions within extensive phone call recordings, interrogation tapes, or public speeches. This capability allows authorities to monitor for specific threats, detect repeated phrases across different communications.\n\n### Implementation Tools\n\n**Dejavu (Python):** Audio fingerprinting and recognition algorithm implemented in Python. The \"fingerprints\" are locality sensitive hashes that are computed from the spectrogram of the audio. This is done by taking the FFT of the signal over overlapping windows of the song and identifying peaks.\n\n**GridHash Algorithm:** The gridhash algorithm is a similarity calculating tool. It allows you to compare how similar one audio track is to another on a scale of 0 (totally dissimilar) to 1 (identical).\n\n### Similarity Matching\n\nThe similarity between two fingerprints is defined as the intersection of their elements (i.e., positions of the salient regions).

The Levenshtein distance between two words is the minimum number of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other.(no content)It is named after Soviet mathematician Vladimir Levenshtein, who defined the metric in 1965.(no content)The Levenshtein distance is useful for tasks like spell checking, DNA sequence alignment, and fuzzy string matching.\n\n### Cosine Similarity\nCosine Similarity is a metric used to measure the cosine of the angle between two vectors in a multi-dimensional space. These vectors represent the term frequency (TF) of words in two documents or strings. In other words, Cosine Similarity quantifies how similar two documents (or strings) are, based on the relative distribution of terms in them.(no content)Cosine similarity is frequently used in information retrieval, document clustering, and recommendation systems.\n\n### Speech Recognition and Transcript Alignment\nThe word error rate (WER), based on Levenshtein distance, remains the de facto standard for benchmarking performance. While WER provides a simple and interpretable summary metric, there is a need for more fine-grained error analysis to better understand, diagnose, and improve model behavior.(no content)Reliable error analysis requires accurate alignment between words in the reference transcript and the model transcript. High-quality alignments allow researchers and practitioners to query the model output for specific words or phrases that were mistranscribed, enabling rapid assessment of error severity for critical vocabulary items.(no content)For graph construction, researchers adopt a slightly modified version of the standard unit-cost Levenshtein distance by doubling the cost of substitutions. In this formulation, every substitution can equivalently be represented as a deletion–insertion pair, which has the effect of expanding the backtrace graph. Relaxing the unit-cost constraint on the search space in this way leads to more accurate alignments.\n\n### Combining Methods\nBoth Levenshtein Distance and Cosine Similarity are powerful techniques for text comparison, but they serve different purposes: Use Levenshtein Distance for fuzzy matching and short text comparisons when minor differences matter. Use Cosine Similarity with TF-IDF when comparing larger text data and considering the semantic structure of the strings.

Hierarchical clustering is then used to group the takes of one scene.\n\n## Scene Detection and Boundary Detection\n\n### Netflix's Approach\nNetflix has developed techniques to align time-stamped text (like closed captions and audio descriptions) with screenplay text (dialogue and action lines), accounting for on-the-fly changes that might result in \"semantically similar but not identical line pairs\" as well as post-shoot changes like reordering, removing, or inserting entire scenes.(no content)Movies and episodes are composed of smaller elements such as frames, shots, scenes, sequences, and acts. Understanding these elements is crucial for tasks such as video summarization, content-based video retrieval, dubbing quality assessment, and video editing. At Netflix, such workflows are performed hundreds of times daily.\n\n### Amazon's ShotCoL Method\nShotCoL improves upon previous state of the art in scene boundary detection on the MovieNet dataset by 13% while being 90% smaller and 84% faster than previous models, requiring 75% less labeled data. These improvements come largely from self-supervised learning, particularly contrastive learning where a model learns to distinguish similar and dissimilar examples.(no content)The ShotCoL model learns to pull together a given shot (the query shot) and the most similar neighboring shot (the key shot) while pushing apart the query shot and randomly selected shots.\n\n## Movie Similarity Using Metadata\nAmazon's Movies2Scenes approach uses movie metadata to define a measure of movie similarity, using it during contrastive learning to limit the search for positive scene-pairs to only movies considered similar to each other.\n\n## NLP Techniques for Text Similarity in Film/Media\n\nFor predicting genres using semantic textual similarity, researchers obtain embeddings using a sentence encoder, then take the inner product with corpus embeddings of training data to represent semantic similarity between descriptions.

Hierarchical clustering is then used to group the takes of one scene.\n\n## Scene Detection and Boundary Detection\n\n### Netflix's Approach\nNetflix has developed techniques to align time-stamped text (like closed captions and audio descriptions) with screenplay text (dialogue and action lines), accounting for on-the-fly changes that might result in \"semantically similar but not identical line pairs\" as well as post-shoot changes like reordering, removing, or inserting entire scenes.(no content)Movies and episodes are composed of smaller elements such as frames, shots, scenes, sequences, and acts. Understanding these elements is crucial for tasks such as video summarization, content-based video retrieval, dubbing quality assessment, and video editing. At Netflix, such workflows are performed hundreds of times daily.\n\n### Amazon's ShotCoL Method\nShotCoL improves upon previous state of the art in scene boundary detection on the MovieNet dataset by 13% while being 90% smaller and 84% faster than previous models, requiring 75% less labeled data. These improvements come largely from self-supervised learning, particularly contrastive learning where a model learns to distinguish similar and dissimilar examples.(no content)The ShotCoL model learns to pull together a given shot (the query shot) and the most similar neighboring shot (the key shot) while pushing apart the query shot and randomly selected shots.\n\n## Movie Similarity Using Metadata\nAmazon's Movies2Scenes approach uses movie metadata to define a measure of movie similarity, using it during contrastive learning to limit the search for positive scene-pairs to only movies considered similar to each other.\n\n## NLP Techniques for Text Similarity in Film/Media\n\nFor predicting genres using semantic textual similarity, researchers obtain embeddings using a sentence encoder, then take the inner product with corpus embeddings of training data to represent semantic similarity between descriptions. The genre of the training sentence with highest similarity is assigned to new content.(no content)Movie recommendation systems apply NLP techniques to recommend movies by analyzing descriptions. Both CountVectorizer and TF-IDF Vectorizer can be employed to transform movie descriptions into numerical features for comparison.\n\nThese approaches combine visual feature extraction, sequence matching algorithms (like LCSS), and NLP text similarity methods to solve various problems in film production and media analysis workflows."],"durationSeconds":26.96096558399964}}

The Script Supervisor (aka Scripty) is the person who liaises directly with the editor. Assistant editors use the Scripty report to find information about each file — especially which takes the director liked — or to find the files themselves.\n\n## OCR Automation for Clapper Board Detection\n\nThe most relevant result for OCR automation comes from **Azure AI Video Indexer**:\n\nClapper board detection finds clapper boards used during filming and gives you the information on the clapper board as metadata, like production, roll, scene, and take. Clapper board is part of post-production insights that you select in the web portal advanced settings when you upload and index the file. Clapper board detection is most commonly used for post-production editing of visual media.\n\n### Limitations of OCR Detection\n\nThe titles of the fields appearing on the clapper board are optimized to identify the most popular fields appearing on top of clapper boards. The fields detection algorithm might not correctly identify handwritten text or digital digits. The algorithm is optimized to identify fields' categories that appear horizontally. The clapper board might not be detected if the frame is blurred or the text written on it can't be read by the human eye.\n\n## Digital Slate Apps\n\nThe MovieSlate iOS app is a convenient, all-in-one digital slate, clapper board, shot log, and notepad used for film, TV, documentaries, music videos, and interviews. Specialist workflows available for production sound mixers, script supervisors, reality series and documentaries.(no content)When the clapper closes, all production and shot data are saved to the History Log. MovieSlate can detect claps from external iPad cases, like the ikan T-Slate.\n\n## Types of Slates\n\nA digital slate, also known as a smart slate or timecode slate, is an electronic version of the traditional film slate that displays scene information and timecode digitally.

Text-Based Detection (Using Transcription Data)\n\nThis is the most practical approach for your use case since you already have transcription capabilities.\n\n**A. Text Similarity Algorithms**\n\n| Algorithm | Best For | Implementation |\n|-----------|----------|----------------|\n| Levenshtein Distance | Fuzzy matching, handling typos/variations | Character-level edit distance |\n| Cosine Similarity + TF-IDF | Semantic similarity of longer passages | Vector space comparison |\n| Longest Common Subsequence (LCSS) | Finding matching dialogue fragments | Sequence alignment |\n| Jaccard Similarity | Word overlap between segments | Set intersection/union |\n\n**Recommended Hybrid Approach:**\n1. Use Levenshtein distance for short phrases (handling minor transcription variations)\n2. Use cosine similarity with sentence embeddings for longer dialogue passages\n3. Combine both to catch \"semantically similar but not identical line pairs\" (Netflix's terminology)\n\n**B. Verbal Cue Detection**\nPattern match transcription text for common markers:\n- \"Take [number]\" / \"Take [spelled out]\"\n- \"Scene [number]\"\n- \"Action\" / \"Cut\" / \"Reset\"\n- Director callouts: \"One more time\", \"Again\", \"Back to one\"\n\n### 2. Audio Fingerprinting Approaches\n\n**Waveprint-Based Method (Modified for Speech):**\n- Frequency range: 100-350 Hz (fundamental vocal frequencies)\n- 40 mel-scale frequency bins for spectrogram\n- Peak pairing and hashing for fingerprint generation\n- Use FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for scalable matching\n- 6 seconds of audio is sufficient for reliable identification\n\n**Duplicate Detection Process:**\n1. Generate fingerprints for all audio segments\n2. Query database for each segment's fingerprints\n3. Mark segments with significant fingerprint overlap as potential duplicates/takes\n4. Cluster similar segments together\n\n**Key Tool:** [Dejavu](https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu) - Python audio fingerprinting library using spectrogram peaks and locality-sensitive hashing.\n\n### 3. Professional Software Approaches\n\n**Adobe Premiere Pro:**\n- Scene Edit Detection uses ML to detect visual/audio changes\n- API available in [Adobe CEP Samples](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples)\n- Analyzes color, brightness, motion, and audio patterns\n\n**Slate Scan Plugin:**\n- Uses OCR to read film slates automatically\n- Extracts scene/take numbers from clapper boards\n- Renames and organizes clips based on slate info\n\n**Azure AI Video Indexer:**\n- Clapper board detection with OCR\n- Extracts production, roll, scene, and take metadata\n- Limitation: may not correctly identify handwritten text\n\n### 4. Academic Research: LCSS for Take Clustering\n\nThe academic paper \"Detecting and Clustering Multiple Takes of One Scene\" describes:\n1. Extract visual features from video frames\n2. Use LCSS (Longest Common Subsequence) algorithm variant to find matching subsequences\n3. Apply hierarchical clustering to group takes of the same scene\n4. This approach handles variations in take length and minor differences\n\n### 5. Recommended Implementation Strategy\n\nFor your transcription-based system, here is a practical algorithm:\n\n```\nTAKE DETECTION ALGORITHM\n\nInput: Array of transcribed segments with timestamps\n\n1. PREPROCESSING\n   - Normalize text (lowercase, remove punctuation)\n   - Tokenize into sentences/phrases\n   - Generate sentence embeddings (optional, for semantic matching)\n\n2. VERBAL CUE DETECTION\n   - Regex patterns for \"Take N\", \"Scene N\", verbal markers\n   - Extract explicit take indicators\n   - Flag segments with cue words\n\n3. SIMILARITY MATRIX\n   For each segment pair (i, j):\n     - Calculate Levenshtein similarity (normalized)\n     - Calculate cosine similarity (if using embeddings)\n     - Combined score = weighted average\n\n4. CLUSTERING\n   - Threshold similarity scores (e.g., > 0.7)\n   - Group segments with high similarity\n   - Use temporal proximity as secondary signal\n     (takes usually occur close together in time)\n\n5. TAKE ORDERING\n   - Within each cluster, order by timestamp\n   - First occurrence = Take 1, etc.\n   - Or use detected verbal cue numbers\n\nOutput: Clusters of takes with labels\n```\n\n### 6. Key Libraries and Tools\n\n| Purpose | Tool | Notes |\n|---------|------|-------|\n| Text similarity | [python-Levenshtein](https://github.com/maxbachmann/rapidfuzz) | Fast edit distance |\n| Sentence embeddings | sentence-transformers | Pre-trained for paraphrase detection |\n| Audio fingerprinting | [Dejavu](https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu) | Python, spectrogram-based |\n| Vector search | FAISS | Scalable similarity search |\n| Whisper timestamps | [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) | Word-level timestamps, reduces hallucinations |\n| Speech alignment | [stable-ts](https://github.com/jianfch/stable-ts) | Timestamp stabilization |\n\n### 7. Handling Edge Cases\n\n**Problem:** Transcription variations between takes\n**Solution:** Use fuzzy matching with Levenshtein distance normalized by string length\n\n**Problem:** Ad-libbed dialogue differs from scripted\n**Solution:** Use semantic similarity (embeddings) rather than exact matching\n\n**Problem:** Same dialogue in different scenes\n**Solution:** Require temporal proximity (within N minutes) for take grouping\n\n**Problem:** Missing verbal cues\n**Solution:** Fall back to text similarity clustering when no explicit markers\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Netflix Tech Blog: Detecting Scene Changes in Audiovisual Content](https://netflixtechblog.com/detecting-scene-changes-in-audiovisual-content-77a61d3eaad6)\n- [Audio Fingerprinting for Speech Retrieval (arXiv)](https://arxiv.org/html/2410.21876v2)\n- [Dejavu: Audio Fingerprinting in Python](https://github.com/worldveil/dejavu)\n- [WhisperX: Word-level Timestamps](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX)\n- [whisper-timestamped](https://github.com/linto-ai/whisper-timestamped)\n- [stable-ts](https://github.com/jianfch/stable-ts)\n- [Adobe Premiere Pro Scene Edit Detection](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/scene-edit-detection.html)\n- [Slate Scan Plugin](https://slatescan.app/)\n- [Azure AI Video Indexer Clapper Board Detection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-video-indexer/clapper-board-insight)\n- [Levenshtein Distance and Cosine Similarity Comparison](https://sila-kazan0626.medium.com/levenshtein-distance-and-cosine-similarity-in-text-comparison-a7adf8134125)\n- [String Similarity Algorithms Guide](https://yassineelkhal.medium.com/the-complete-guide-to-string-similarity-algorithms-1290ad07c6b7)\n- [Detecting and Clustering Multiple Takes (Springer)](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-77409-9_8)\n- [Amazon ShotCoL Scene Boundary Detection](https://www.amazon.science/blog/automatically-identifying-scene-boundaries-in-movies-and-tv-shows)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":700,"cache_read_input_tokens":22973,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":700,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWBKcFthJ2oXPV6UoPS6x","type":"assistant","uuid":"7a91be50-3ac9-4c72-b901-10337d45ac10","timestamp":"2025-12-17T00:35:49.150Z"}
