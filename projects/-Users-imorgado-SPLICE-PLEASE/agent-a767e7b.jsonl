If not enough silences are being reduced, increase the threshold to a higher (less negative) number.(no content)If there is noticeable background noise, you may need to set the threshold as a higher (less negative) value than the default. Silences are detected if they remain below the specified threshold for at least the specified time duration.\n\n### Key Audacity Parameters:\n- Audacity uses certain thresholds to decide what is silence: Min Duration, Max Duration, and Silence Threshold. These settings will decide what is considered silence and remove them.\n- Silence Compression determines how much of the silence is removed. Instead of removing all silence, Audacity compresses it. For example, using 3:1 compression, a 3-second period of silence would be compressed down to 1 second.\n\n### Practical Podcast Settings:\nIf a longer silence, like 2.1 or more seconds, is already recorded into your audio, you can use Truncate Silence to shorten everything longer than 2 seconds down to exactly two seconds. Set your min and max silences to 2000 ms and compression to 1:1. You may have to play with the threshold to find the right level for your background noise.(no content)One editor describes importing their podcast file into Audacity and running the truncate silence effect using 0.5 seconds, so all the silence is shortened to 0.5 seconds.\n\n## Descript's Approach\n\nDescript allows you to remove or trim unwanted gaps, word gaps, and pauses from audio and video. The best part is you choose how much dead air to keep so everything flows smoothly.(no content)Once uploaded, Descript will transcribe your file, showing any silences or pauses as gray bars.(no content)You can highlight and press backspace to remove or trim silences in both transcript and media. Or select Actions > Shorten word gaps to systematically cut silences from your audio at once or in steps. Descript also lets you fine-tune how sensitive the silence detection is, along with setting a default word gap length.(no content)Descript turns editing into a text experience where you can see silences right in your transcript and delete them like you're backspacing through a typo.\n\n## Comparison & Professional Recommendations\n\nAudacity's Truncate Silence effect lets you set precise thresholds for silence detection and removal. It's completely free and open-source with no watermarks or limitations, offering granular control over silence detection parameters.(no content)For podcasts or audio-only projects, Audacity might suffice. For an all-in-one solution that handles both audio and video with text-based editing, Descript offers the most intuitive experience.(no content)Professional editors develop content-specific templates and workflows that streamline the editing process while ensuring appropriate treatment for each content type.

Usually done to heighten the anticipation before a reveal.(no content)Also called a \"Pregnant Pause\", it can also follow the reveal when something is particularly shocking.(no content)Dead air, by contrast, is a gap caused by a gaffe – a miscalculation, a technical mistake, a brain freeze. A pause is intentional, dead air is accidental.(no content)Intentional silence has purpose and timing. Dead air has neither. A well-placed pause feels natural and meaningful, while dead air feels accidental and disruptive.\n\n## Pause Duration Guidelines\n\nA pause for effect is typically shorter, usually just 1 to 2 seconds.(no content)A reflective pause—which gives your audience time to think—can last from 3 to 7 seconds.\n\n## The Role of Pacing in Film Editing\n\nA lot of great editors believe pacing is managing and utilizing the space in a scene—space meaning dead air. Some of the greatest examples of pacing come from Quentin Tarantino. The pacing of the conversations in his films really sets the bar for pacing.(no content)Scenes can be masterpieces when it comes to pacing even when the pacing is very slow. Managing the space well, with long pauses between lines of dialogue, can feel just right.(no content)A large part of what editors do is controlling how the audience experiences the passage of time. Part of the reason why movies resonate with us is because they mimic and reflect how we experience time.\n\n## Broadcast Standards for Dialogue\n\nWhen mixing in a dub stage for theatrical, spoken dialogue should run around -10 to -12 dB, with very quiet whispers getting as far down as -20ish and screams hitting 0.(no content)If you are mixing for broadcast delivery, you need to get the channel/network specs and make it sound as good as possible within those specs.(no content)The American (ATSC A85) and European (EBU R128) specifications aim towards the film model of professionals mixing in calibrated environments by ear.

Usually done to heighten the anticipation before a reveal.(no content)Also called a \"Pregnant Pause\", it can also follow the reveal when something is particularly shocking.(no content)Dead air, by contrast, is a gap caused by a gaffe – a miscalculation, a technical mistake, a brain freeze. A pause is intentional, dead air is accidental.(no content)Intentional silence has purpose and timing. Dead air has neither. A well-placed pause feels natural and meaningful, while dead air feels accidental and disruptive.\n\n## Pause Duration Guidelines\n\nA pause for effect is typically shorter, usually just 1 to 2 seconds.(no content)A reflective pause—which gives your audience time to think—can last from 3 to 7 seconds.\n\n## The Role of Pacing in Film Editing\n\nA lot of great editors believe pacing is managing and utilizing the space in a scene—space meaning dead air. Some of the greatest examples of pacing come from Quentin Tarantino. The pacing of the conversations in his films really sets the bar for pacing.(no content)Scenes can be masterpieces when it comes to pacing even when the pacing is very slow. Managing the space well, with long pauses between lines of dialogue, can feel just right.(no content)A large part of what editors do is controlling how the audience experiences the passage of time. Part of the reason why movies resonate with us is because they mimic and reflect how we experience time.\n\n## Broadcast Standards for Dialogue\n\nWhen mixing in a dub stage for theatrical, spoken dialogue should run around -10 to -12 dB, with very quiet whispers getting as far down as -20ish and screams hitting 0.(no content)If you are mixing for broadcast delivery, you need to get the channel/network specs and make it sound as good as possible within those specs.(no content)The American (ATSC A85) and European (EBU R128) specifications aim towards the film model of professionals mixing in calibrated environments by ear. These standards measure spectrum content and factor in RMS levels.(no content)In the broadcast world, level standards are fairly rigid with the 'dialog norm', which typically has a very narrow range with less dynamic range than theatrical because it's television.\n\n## Technical Editing Tips\n\nIf you cut silence between lines, you may need to add matching room tone. Removing silence entirely can create unnatural shifts in background noise, especially when combining takes from different parts of a session. Room tone fills in the space and makes dialogue edits feel seamless.(no content)Tools like Reaper's Dynamic Split for bulk silence cuts and Auto Trim give editors control over silence thresholds and make it simple to prepare content for podcasts or broadcast delivery."],"durationSeconds":28.23277837499976}}

It's best for short recordings, high-stakes projects, or situations where you can't risk removing parts of speech.\n\nThere are two main approaches:\n- The two methods for removing sounds are DELETE and SILENCE. Most of the time, you will want to delete the 'um' because this is a pause used to search for a word.\n- Silence, on the other hand, does not shorten the audio file length. It simply takes the existing sound and reduces it below hearing levels. Meaning it takes the breath and drops the portion of the file to zero dB or below. Since taking a breath to speak is natural, the silence leaves this natural break in the conversation intact.\n\n### Using Plugins and Automation\nWhen using breath control plugins, set detection sensitivity at a moderate setting so it catches breathing but not soft speech sounds like \"h\" or \"f.\" A 40–70% reduction often keeps voices sounding natural while still cleaning the track.\n\n### Pause Duration Control\nBreathCut is designed to remove breathing sounds while maintaining natural speech rhythm and flow. Rather than creating abrupt cuts, the tool intelligently adjusts the timing to ensure your audio sounds professional and natural. You can also control the pause duration to match your preference.\n\n### Noise Gate Settings\nA noise gate opens and closes based on a threshold that is set allowing for the desired vocal passage to flow through while cutting off the undesired portion. Today's DAW (digital audio workstations) come equipped with plugins. Programs such as Audacity and Adobe Audition come stocked with noise gates. Next set the threshold, attack, release and noise floor.\n\n### AI-Powered Tools\nSeveral AI tools are available for automatic breath removal:\n- Cleanvoice offers an AI-powered solution that detects and removes unwanted breathing sounds automatically. The AI can distinguish normal, expressive breathing sounds and heavy, distracting breaths. That way, you keep the ambiance without annoying your listeners.\n- When Auphonic's \"Remove Breathings\" option is enabled, all the inhalation and exhalation sounds will be muted. They've also integrated the elimination of all types of mouth noises, such as smacking, chewing and clicking. These sounds are set to silence in your output file.\n\n### Why Keep Natural Pauses\nThe more you sound like a human being, and not a machine, the easier dialogue is to understand. Breaths also act as a bit of a 'signpost'; intuitively the listener knows that there will be a short pause.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c8e632de-54f1-47c1-8743-d716491b56a2","timestamp":"2025-12-17T00:34:05.574Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"breath pause duration audio editing milliseconds remove breath sounds podcast","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Uqbq5BVTLGXtGxcXu7khqj","content":[{"title":"How to Remove Breathing from Audio: 5 Simple Methods - Hollyland","url":"https://www.hollyland.com/blog/tips/remove-breathing-from-audio"},{"title":"BreathCut | Remove Breathing from Audio","url":"https://audioclipper.work/"},{"title":"Remove Breathing From Audio Online | Free & Easy Editor","url":"https://www.descript.com/tools/remove-breathing-from-audio"},{"title":"How to Remove Breathing from Audio: Practical Tips + AI Tools | Cleanvoice AI","url":"https://cleanvoice.ai/blog/remove-breathing-from-audio/"},{"title":"Should you delete or silence the breath? - Podcast Center LA","url":"https://www.podcastcenterla.com/delete-silence-breath/"},{"title":"Remove Breathing From Audio and Video: With 3 Clicks Using AI | Cleanvoice AI","url":"https://cleanvoice.ai/breath-remover/"},{"title":"Solved: How do I remove breaths from long recordings to sa... - Adobe Product Community - 10447064","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/audition/how-do-i-remove-breaths-from-long-recordings-to-save-time/td-p/10447064"},{"title":"GrooveDen - Royalty Free Music Library - Eliminate Breath and Swallow Sounds When Recording Your Podcast","url":"https://www.grooveden.com/eliminate-breath-and-swallow-sounds-when-recording-your-podcast"},{"title":"Deleting Breaths Out Of Podcast - General Audio Programming - Audacity Forum","url":"https://forum.audacityteam.org/t/deleting-breaths-out-of-podcast/62971"},{"title":"Auphonic Blog: Eliminate Breathing Sounds and Mouth Noises","url":"https://auphonic.com/blog/2023/11/29/eliminate-breathing-sounds-and-mouth-noises/"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about removing breath sounds from audio in podcast editing:\n\n## Methods for Removing Breath Sounds\n\n### Manual Editing Techniques\nManual editing is the most precise way to clean up breathing noises.

You should pick a threshold between these two values (such as -35 dBFS) so that the tool picks out only the portions below that threshold as silences.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\nSetting thresholds too aggressively (too high in negative dB values) can cause the tool to identify quiet speech or music as silence, leading to unwanted cuts in actual content. Conversely, setting thresholds too conservatively may miss obvious silences that should be removed.(no content)If there is noticeable background noise, you may need to set the threshold as a higher (less negative) value than the default.(no content)Since all normal signals are less than the full track height, the threshold will always be a negative number. Thus -40 dB is quieter than -30 dB, and -20 dB is higher (louder) than -30 dB.\n\n### Duration Settings\n\nFor duration timing, use 1-2 second detection durations for speech content to preserve natural rhythm, and 0.5-1 second durations for music to maintain artistic timing.(no content)A good starting point for minimum silence duration is 750ms.

Silence Threshold (dB/dBFS)**\nThe Noise Level parameter defines what AutoCut considers a \"silence.\" It's measured in decibels (dB) — any audio quieter than this threshold will be treated as silence.(no content)The threshold (in dBFS) determines the audio level below which tools consider as silence.

Lower it → keeps soft sounds like breathing or ambience.\n- For most talking-head videos, a slightly higher threshold gives cleaner results.\n\n**2. Minimum Silence Duration**\nThe minimum silence duration is the minimum duration for which your audio needs to be below the threshold in order to be detected as a silence portion that should be cut.

Silence Threshold (dB/dBFS)**\nThe Noise Level parameter defines what AutoCut considers a \"silence.\" It's measured in decibels (dB) — any audio quieter than this threshold will be treated as silence.(no content)The threshold (in dBFS) determines the audio level below which tools consider as silence.

Industry Standard Thresholds\n\n**Silence Detection (dB thresholds):**\n- Speech content: **-30 to -40 dBFS** (starting point)\n- Clean recordings: **-40 dB** (Audacity default)\n- Noisy recordings: **-20 to -30 dB** (higher threshold for background noise)\n- Music: **-60 dB**\n\n**Minimum Duration for Silence Cut:**\n- Conservative: **750ms** (recommended starting point)\n- Aggressive: **500ms** (may cut natural pauses)\n- Very conservative: **2000ms** (only long gaps)\n\n### 3. Differentiating Pause Types\n\n**Dramatic Pauses (KEEP):**\n- Duration: 1-2 seconds\n- Characteristics: Intentional, preceded by complete thought, creates anticipation\n- Context: Before reveals, after impactful statements\n- Detection: Often follows complete sentences, speaker maintains engagement\n\n**Breath Pauses (KEEP short ones):**\n- Duration: 150-400ms\n- Characteristics: Natural respiration, acts as \"signpost\" for listeners\n- Recommendation: Silence (reduce to -inf dB) rather than delete\n- Keep the timing, remove the noise\n\n**Dead Air / Mistakes (CUT):**\n- Duration: >2 seconds with no intentional purpose\n- Characteristics: Accidental, brain freeze, technical issues\n- Detection: Unplanned, disrupts flow, no artistic value\n- Unlike dramatic pauses, lacks \"purpose and timing\"\n\n**Between-Take Silence (CUT):**\n- Duration: Typically 3-10+ seconds\n- Characteristics: Complete silence or room tone only\n- Detection: Often preceded by verbal markers (\"cut\", \"again\", clapper sounds)\n- May contain slate/clapper audio signature\n\n### 4. Configurable Parameters (Professional Tools)\n\n**AutoCut / Premiere Pro Extensions:**\n```\nNoise Level Threshold: -30 to -40 dBFS\nMinimum Silence Duration: 750ms (default)\nPadding/Buffer: 50-150ms (prevents cutting word edges)\n```\n\n**Audacity Truncate Silence:**\n```\nThreshold: -40 dB (default, range -20 to -80)\nMin Duration: 500-2000ms\nCompression Ratio: 3:1 (shortens without removing)\n```\n\n**Breath Removal:**\n```\nDetection Sensitivity: 40-70% (moderate)\nReduction: 40-70% (not 100%, keeps naturalness)\n```\n\n### 5. Recommended Default Configuration for Splice\n\n```typescript\nconst pauseDetectionConfig = {\n  // Silence detection\n  silenceThresholdDb: -35,           // dBFS, adjustable -20 to -50\n  \n  // Duration thresholds (milliseconds)\n  minSilenceDuration: 750,           // Minimum to consider as silence\n  naturalPauseMax: 1500,             // Keep pauses under this\n  deadAirThreshold: 2500,            // Flag as potential cut above this\n  betweenTakeThreshold: 5000,        // Likely between-take above this\n  \n  // Padding to prevent cutting word edges\n  paddingMs: 100,                    // Buffer before/after cuts\n  \n  // Breath handling\n  breathReduction: 0.6,              // 60% reduction (not full removal)\n  keepBreathTiming: true,            // Silence but don't delete\n  \n  // Compression option (alternative to cutting)\n  compressionRatio: 3,               // 3:1 shortens without jarring cuts\n  maxCompressedSilence: 500,         // Target duration after compression\n};\n```\n\n### 6. Key Insights from Research\n\n1. **Linguistic research uses 270ms as minimum pause threshold** for speech analysis\n\n2. **Filled pauses (\"um\", \"uh\") occur 2-6 times per 100 words** in natural speech - removing all creates unnatural audio\n\n3. **Professional speakers have different pause patterns** than casual speakers - fewer disfluencies, shorter sentences\n\n4. **Room tone matters**: When cutting silence, may need to fill with matching room tone to avoid jarring transitions\n\n5. **Context is critical**: A 3-second pause in a dramatic scene is intentional; the same pause in a podcast interview is dead air\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Audacity Truncate Silence Manual](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/truncate_silence.html)\n- [Descript Silence Remover](https://www.descript.com/tools/silence-remover)\n- [AutoCut Silences Parameters](https://www.autocut.com/en/blogs/autocut-silences-parameters/)\n- [FireCut Remove Silences](https://learn.firecut.ai/features/remove-silences)\n- [Adobe Audition Strip Silence](https://helpx.adobe.com/audition/using/strip-silence.html)\n- [Structure of Pauses in Speech (EURASIP Journal)](https://asmp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13636-016-0096-7)\n- [Cleanvoice Breath Remover](https://cleanvoice.ai/breath-remover/)\n- [Podcast Center LA - Delete or Silence Breath](https://www.podcastcenterla.com/delete-silence-breath/)\n- [Audiodrome - Dead Air Definition](https://audiodrome.net/glossary/dead-air/)\n- [Broadcast Voice Podcast - Pause vs Dead Air](https://shows.acast.com/get-your-best-broadcast-podcast-and-video-voice/episodes/0423-the-difference-between-a-pause-and-dead-air)\n- [Technology.org - Silence Detection Tools](https://www.technology.org/2024/10/01/best-5-silence-detection-tools-for-professional-audio-quality/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2387,"cache_read_input_tokens":20493,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2387,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWBKa1VDMUnS78LVjMp4j","type":"assistant","uuid":"6708547f-90d6-4512-b3bb-173ab0d6fed2","timestamp":"2025-12-17T00:35:22.293Z"}
