    58→**The Protocol:**
    59→1. **Brush 2x daily** — Electric toothbrush, 2 minutes minimum. If you're using a manual toothbrush in 2024, that's NPC behavior.
    60→2. **Floss daily** — Yes, actually. The stuff between your teeth is rotting. Get string floss or a water flosser.
    61→3. **Tongue scrape** — This is the secret weapon. 70% of bad breath comes from bacteria on your tongue. Takes 10 seconds, changes everything.

    64→- You can't smell your own breath

    95→- Apply lip balm or Aquaphor morning and night
    96→- Reapply after eating or drinking

   294→- Buzz it short or shave clean
