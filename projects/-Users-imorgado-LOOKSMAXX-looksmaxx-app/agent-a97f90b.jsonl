Minoxidil can help improve beard density.\n\n### Mewing\nMewing is a practice that supposedly improves facial bones (such as the position of the maxilla) through adopting correct tongue posture.(no content)Some guides recommend to \"always mouth tape and mew in your sleep.\"\n\n### Skincare\nSkincare is considered the most important softmax by far, with \"glowing glass skin\" being described as a huge halo.(no content)For face care, recommended approaches include sunscreen and possibly dermarolling. \"Skincare\" is considered somewhat ineffective unless you have a particular skin condition and are using a science-backed treatment for it.(no content)Examples of grooming include following a skincare routine, haircuts, styling facial hair and eyebrows. One could also include anti-aging serums like retin-A (tretinoin) or dermarolling methods that may slow collagen loss.\n\n### Other Softmaxxing Tips\nChronic stress leads to inflammation and cortisol, which causes moonface and eye bags. Maintaining a proper potassium to sodium ratio (approximately 3:1) is considered critical, as imbalance leads to puffiness and a softer jawline.(no content)Good eyebrows are considered one of the highest ROI softmaxxes.

How FaceIQ Calculates \"Your Potential\" Scores\n\n### Scoring Formula Components\n\nBased on community-documented formulas, FaceIQ uses four main scoring categories:\n\n| Category | Weight | Description |\n|----------|--------|-------------|\n| **HARM (Harmony)** | 32% | Proportional balance of facial features (27 characteristics including jaw width, facial thirds, eye spacing, gonial angle) |\n| **DIMO (Dimorphism)** | 20% | Masculine/feminine characteristics (11 features: eye depth, brow ridge, chin structure, facial hair) |\n| **ANGU (Angularity)** | 20% | Facial definition and sharpness (9 measurements: mandible visibility, cheekbone prominence, jaw contours) |\n| **MISC (Miscellaneous)** | 26% | Skin quality, eye area, coloring, lower third, lips, nose, symmetry (7 categories) |\n\n### Score Calculation Process\n\n1. **Raw Score Calculation**: Each category has its own scale converted to 0-100\n2. **Weighted Average**: `(HARM*0.32) + (MISC*0.26) + (ANGU*0.22) + (DIMO*0.20)`\n3. **Balance Penalty**: Calculate spread between highest and lowest category scores; apply penalty: `spread * 0.5` subtracted from weighted average\n4. **Final Rating**: Result produces 1-10 rating reflecting \"balance and cohesion\"\n\n### Alternative Weighting (Some Sources)\n- Harmony: 40%\n- Features: 25%\n- Dimorphism: 20%\n- Angularity: 15%\n\n---\n\n## 3. Improvement Percentage Estimates\n\n### Weight Loss / Leanmaxxing Impact\n\nFrom user reports with FaceIQ ratings:\n\n| Change | Impact |\n|--------|--------|\n| Losing to 15% body fat | +1.5 points overall |\n| Angularity improvement | +4 points (subscale) |\n| Harmony improvement | +1 point (subscale) |\n| Dimorphism improvement | +1 point (subscale) |\n\n**Leanmaxxing effects documented:**\n- Better EME (eye-mouth-eye) ratios\n- Better philtrum to chin ratios\n- Improved ogee curves\n- Deeper canine fossa\n- Better jawline visibility\n\n### Morph Improvement Examples\n\nFrom user-shared FaceIQ analyses:\n\n| Original Score | Morphed Score | Change | Modifications |\n|---------------|---------------|--------|---------------|\n| Top 26% harmony | Top 0.3% harmony | ~85 percentile jump | Extended nose/forehead by \"a couple mm\" |\n| Base morph | 8.73 (top 0.002%) | Major improvement | Lowered mouth, droopier nose tip |\n\n**Important caveat**: Users note that even with high harmony improvements, the visual difference may appear minimal due to other factors (angle, misc features).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment Recommendations System\n\n### FaceIQ's \"Your Plan\" Features\n\nAccording to official documentation:\n- Personalized treatment options based on facial analysis data\n- Projected potential scores after treatments\n- Both surgical and non-surgical recommendations\n- \"Order of Operations\" step-by-step plan\n\n**Disclaimer**: All recommendations are for \"educational and informational purposes only\" - not medical advice.\n\n### Example Recommendations from User Reports\n\nOne user (4/10 rating, bottom 25%) received:\n\n**Identified Flaws:**\n- Philtrum length ratio: 1.75 (ideal: 0.325-0.4)\n- Upper eyelid excess (UEE)\n- Facial recession\n- Thin upper lip\n\n**Recommended Procedures:**\n1. Bimax (bilateral maxillary-mandibular advancement)\n2. Upper eyelid fat grafting\n3. Lip flip surgery\n4. Jaw angle implants (post-bimax)\n5. Lip lift (for philtrum correction)\n\n**Projected outcome**: \"Mid-tier normie status achievable; high-tier normie unlikely given structural limitations\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Order of Operations for Treatment Plans\n\n### General Surgical Sequencing Principles\n\n1. **Foundation First**: Address skeletal structure before soft tissue\n2. **Recession Before Enhancement**: Fix recession with bimax/Le Fort before implants\n3. **Nose After Jaw**: Rhinoplasty after bimax (bimax widens nose)\n4. **Implants Last**: Jaw angle implants after skeletal procedures\n\n### Typical Sequence from Community\n\n1. **Bimax/Le Fort** (if recessed) - Foundation\n2. **Genioplasty** (if needed) - Often combined with bimax as \"trimax\"\n3. **Rhinoplasty** - After jaw has settled\n4. **Implants** (jaw angle, cheek, etc.) - Fine-tuning\n5. **Soft tissue procedures** - Last stage\n\n**Example user plan**: \"trimax first, then rhino, then implants, then LL [limb lengthening]\" with \"necessary rest periods\" between.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Hardmaxxing Tier List (ROI Ranking)\n\n### S-Tier (Highest ROI)\n| Procedure | Rationale |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Otoplasty | Very safe, affordable, high impact for those with flared ears |\n| Fat grafting/transfer | Inexpensive, permanent, addresses common deficiencies |\n| Genioplasty | Low-cost, minimal risk, often insurance-covered |\n| Bimax/Trimax | Best ROI if done properly, transforms severe recession |\n| Hair transplant | Minimal risk, affordable via Turkey, dramatic impact |\n\n### A-Tier (Strong ROI)\n| Procedure | Notes |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Lower eyelid retraction repair | Inexpensive, low danger |\n| Implants | Quick results, customizable (infection risk) |\n| Buccal fat removal | Excellent for low body-fat individuals |\n| Canthoplasty/canthopexy | Affordable, may need future adjustments |\n| Rhinoplasty | High impact for obvious nasal issues |\n| Limb lengthening | Transformative for height (lengthy recovery) |\n\n### B-Tier (Moderate ROI)\n| Procedure | Notes |\n|-----------|-------|\n| MSE + face pulling | Excellent orthodontics |\n| Fillers/Botox | Quickest/easiest but requires maintenance |\n| Lip lift | Low risk, affordable, situational |\n| Chin wing osteotomy | Moderate cost, botch potential |\n\n### C-Tier (Limited ROI)\n| Procedure | Notes |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Orbital decompression | Good surgery but 1/5 botch rate |\n| Brow lift | Situational effectiveness |\n\n### D-Tier (Poor ROI)\n| Procedure | Notes |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Clavicle lengthening | Extremely expensive, extended disability |\n| Liposuction | Natural weight loss recommended instead |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Softmaxxing vs Hardmaxxing Recommendations\n\n### Softmaxxing (Non-invasive, reversible)\n**Community consensus: 50-70% of looks potential comes from softmaxxing**\n\n| Category | Recommendations |\n|----------|-----------------|\n| **Skincare** | \"Most important softmax\" - sunscreen, tretinoin, dermarolling |\n| **Leanmaxxing** | Cut to 10-15% body fat for visible bone structure |\n| **Mewing** | Correct tongue posture (more effective for younger people) |\n| **Minoxidil** | Oral 10x stronger than topical but heart risks; topical safer |\n| **Eyebrows** | \"One of highest ROI softmaxxes\" - slightly darker than hair |\n| **Sleep/Stress** | Reduce inflammation/cortisol for less puffiness |\n| **Electrolytes** | 3:1 potassium:sodium ratio reduces facial puffiness |\n\n### When to Hardmax\n\nPer community consensus:\n1. Complete all softmaxxing first\n2. Reach natural genetic ceiling\n3. Live with baseline appearance for years\n4. Consult qualified professionals\n5. Only proceed if specific structural issues identified\n\n**Warning**: \"Hardmaxxing is permanent, high-risk optimization that can be transformative only after full softmaxxing, but will permanently worsen your appearance if misapplied or rushed.\"\n\n---\n\n## 8. Cost-Benefit Analysis Methodology\n\n### Factors Considered\n\n1. **Impact** (how much improvement possible)\n2. **Cost** (financial investment required)\n3. **Risk** (botch rate, complications, reversibility)\n4. **Recovery** (downtime, healing period)\n5. **Specificity** (how many people actually need it)\n\n### Pound-for-Pound Analysis\n\nUser argument: \"Tier lists should consider cost into their rankings.\"\n\nExample: While geniplasty/bimax is top-tier for impact, rhinoplasty for a bulbous nose \"is a fraction of the cost\" so ranks higher on value basis.\n\n### Risk-Adjusted Returns\n\n| Procedure | Impact | Risk | Value Assessment |\n|-----------|--------|------|------------------|\n| Bimax | Very High | Moderate | High value IF indicated |\n| Rhinoplasty | High | Moderate | High value for obvious issues |\n| Orbital decompression | High | High (1/5 botch) | Lower value due to risk |\n| Fat grafting | Moderate | Low | Good value |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Accuracy & Reliability Concerns\n\n### User-Reported Issues with FaceIQ\n\n| Concern | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Score inflation** | \"It heavily overrates if anything\" - some report subtracting 1.5 points |\n| **Landmark placement** | Incorrect placement leads to inflated scores |\n| **Feature limitations** | \"None of these apps take into account shape and tightness of each feature\" |\n| **Inconsistency** | Same user got scores from 4/10 to 6.29/10 depending on photo conditions |\n| **Deep-set eyes** | Tool requires guessing for hidden upper eyelids |\n| **Gonial angle mapping** | Difficult to accurately mark on photos |\n\n### Reliability Tips from Users\n\n1. Run 3-4 tests and exclude outliers\n2. Avoid 2x zoom (causes score deflation)\n3. Follow landmark placement instructions carefully\n4. Use consistent lighting and angle\n5. Consider scores as estimates, not absolutes\n\n---\n\n## 10. Morphing/Simulation Methodology\n\n### What FaceIQ Provides\n\n- Custom morph showing potential changes\n- Before/after comparison\n- Estimated score change with modifications\n\n### Technical Approach (Inferred)\n\n1. Identify facial features below ideal ratios\n2. Digitally adjust those features toward ideal values\n3. Recalculate harmony score on morphed image\n4.

How FaceIQ Calculates \"Your Potential\" Scores\n\n### Scoring Formula Components\n\nBased on community-documented formulas, FaceIQ uses four main scoring categories:\n\n| Category | Weight | Description |\n|----------|--------|-------------|\n| **HARM (Harmony)** | 32% | Proportional balance of facial features (27 characteristics including jaw width, facial thirds, eye spacing, gonial angle) |\n| **DIMO (Dimorphism)** | 20% | Masculine/feminine characteristics (11 features: eye depth, brow ridge, chin structure, facial hair) |\n| **ANGU (Angularity)** | 20% | Facial definition and sharpness (9 measurements: mandible visibility, cheekbone prominence, jaw contours) |\n| **MISC (Miscellaneous)** | 26% | Skin quality, eye area, coloring, lower third, lips, nose, symmetry (7 categories) |\n\n### Score Calculation Process\n\n1. **Raw Score Calculation**: Each category has its own scale converted to 0-100\n2. **Weighted Average**: `(HARM*0.32) + (MISC*0.26) + (ANGU*0.22) + (DIMO*0.20)`\n3. **Balance Penalty**: Calculate spread between highest and lowest category scores; apply penalty: `spread * 0.5` subtracted from weighted average\n4. **Final Rating**: Result produces 1-10 rating reflecting \"balance and cohesion\"\n\n### Alternative Weighting (Some Sources)\n- Harmony: 40%\n- Features: 25%\n- Dimorphism: 20%\n- Angularity: 15%\n\n---\n\n## 3. Improvement Percentage Estimates\n\n### Weight Loss / Leanmaxxing Impact\n\nFrom user reports with FaceIQ ratings:\n\n| Change | Impact |\n|--------|--------|\n| Losing to 15% body fat | +1.5 points overall |\n| Angularity improvement | +4 points (subscale) |\n| Harmony improvement | +1 point (subscale) |\n| Dimorphism improvement | +1 point (subscale) |\n\n**Leanmaxxing effects documented:**\n- Better EME (eye-mouth-eye) ratios\n- Better philtrum to chin ratios\n- Improved ogee curves\n- Deeper canine fossa\n- Better jawline visibility\n\n### Morph Improvement Examples\n\nFrom user-shared FaceIQ analyses:\n\n| Original Score | Morphed Score | Change | Modifications |\n|---------------|---------------|--------|---------------|\n| Top 26% harmony | Top 0.3% harmony | ~85 percentile jump | Extended nose/forehead by \"a couple mm\" |\n| Base morph | 8.73 (top 0.002%) | Major improvement | Lowered mouth, droopier nose tip |\n\n**Important caveat**: Users note that even with high harmony improvements, the visual difference may appear minimal due to other factors (angle, misc features).\n\n---\n\n## 4. Treatment Recommendations System\n\n### FaceIQ's \"Your Plan\" Features\n\nAccording to official documentation:\n- Personalized treatment options based on facial analysis data\n- Projected potential scores after treatments\n- Both surgical and non-surgical recommendations\n- \"Order of Operations\" step-by-step plan\n\n**Disclaimer**: All recommendations are for \"educational and informational purposes only\" - not medical advice.\n\n### Example Recommendations from User Reports\n\nOne user (4/10 rating, bottom 25%) received:\n\n**Identified Flaws:**\n- Philtrum length ratio: 1.75 (ideal: 0.325-0.4)\n- Upper eyelid excess (UEE)\n- Facial recession\n- Thin upper lip\n\n**Recommended Procedures:**\n1. Bimax (bilateral maxillary-mandibular advancement)\n2. Upper eyelid fat grafting\n3. Lip flip surgery\n4. Jaw angle implants (post-bimax)\n5. Lip lift (for philtrum correction)\n\n**Projected outcome**: \"Mid-tier normie status achievable; high-tier normie unlikely given structural limitations\"\n\n---\n\n## 5. Order of Operations for Treatment Plans\n\n### General Surgical Sequencing Principles\n\n1. **Foundation First**: Address skeletal structure before soft tissue\n2. **Recession Before Enhancement**: Fix recession with bimax/Le Fort before implants\n3. **Nose After Jaw**: Rhinoplasty after bimax (bimax widens nose)\n4. **Implants Last**: Jaw angle implants after skeletal procedures\n\n### Typical Sequence from Community\n\n1. **Bimax/Le Fort** (if recessed) - Foundation\n2. **Genioplasty** (if needed) - Often combined with bimax as \"trimax\"\n3. **Rhinoplasty** - After jaw has settled\n4. **Implants** (jaw angle, cheek, etc.) - Fine-tuning\n5. **Soft tissue procedures** - Last stage\n\n**Example user plan**: \"trimax first, then rhino, then implants, then LL [limb lengthening]\" with \"necessary rest periods\" between.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Hardmaxxing Tier List (ROI Ranking)\n\n### S-Tier (Highest ROI)\n| Procedure | Rationale |\n|-----------|-----------|\n| Otoplasty | Very safe, affordable, high impact for those with flared ears |\n| Fat grafting/transfer | Inexpensive, permanent, addresses common deficiencies |\n| Genioplasty | Low-cost, minimal risk, often insurance-covered |\n| Bimax/Trimax | Best ROI if done properly, transforms severe recession |\n| Hair transplant | Minimal risk, affordable via Turkey, dramatic impact |\n\n### A-Tier (Strong ROI)\n| Procedure | Notes |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Lower eyelid retraction repair | Inexpensive, low danger |\n| Implants | Quick results, customizable (infection risk) |\n| Buccal fat removal | Excellent for low body-fat individuals |\n| Canthoplasty/canthopexy | Affordable, may need future adjustments |\n| Rhinoplasty | High impact for obvious nasal issues |\n| Limb lengthening | Transformative for height (lengthy recovery) |\n\n### B-Tier (Moderate ROI)\n| Procedure | Notes |\n|-----------|-------|\n| MSE + face pulling | Excellent orthodontics |\n| Fillers/Botox | Quickest/easiest but requires maintenance |\n| Lip lift | Low risk, affordable, situational |\n| Chin wing osteotomy | Moderate cost, botch potential |\n\n### C-Tier (Limited ROI)\n| Procedure | Notes |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Orbital decompression | Good surgery but 1/5 botch rate |\n| Brow lift | Situational effectiveness |\n\n### D-Tier (Poor ROI)\n| Procedure | Notes |\n|-----------|-------|\n| Clavicle lengthening | Extremely expensive, extended disability |\n| Liposuction | Natural weight loss recommended instead |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Softmaxxing vs Hardmaxxing Recommendations\n\n### Softmaxxing (Non-invasive, reversible)\n**Community consensus: 50-70% of looks potential comes from softmaxxing**\n\n| Category | Recommendations |\n|----------|-----------------|\n| **Skincare** | \"Most important softmax\" - sunscreen, tretinoin, dermarolling |\n| **Leanmaxxing** | Cut to 10-15% body fat for visible bone structure |\n| **Mewing** | Correct tongue posture (more effective for younger people) |\n| **Minoxidil** | Oral 10x stronger than topical but heart risks; topical safer |\n| **Eyebrows** | \"One of highest ROI softmaxxes\" - slightly darker than hair |\n| **Sleep/Stress** | Reduce inflammation/cortisol for less puffiness |\n| **Electrolytes** | 3:1 potassium:sodium ratio reduces facial puffiness |\n\n### When to Hardmax\n\nPer community consensus:\n1. Complete all softmaxxing first\n2. Reach natural genetic ceiling\n3. Live with baseline appearance for years\n4. Consult qualified professionals\n5. Only proceed if specific structural issues identified\n\n**Warning**: \"Hardmaxxing is permanent, high-risk optimization that can be transformative only after full softmaxxing, but will permanently worsen your appearance if misapplied or rushed.\"\n\n---\n\n## 8. Cost-Benefit Analysis Methodology\n\n### Factors Considered\n\n1. **Impact** (how much improvement possible)\n2. **Cost** (financial investment required)\n3. **Risk** (botch rate, complications, reversibility)\n4. **Recovery** (downtime, healing period)\n5. **Specificity** (how many people actually need it)\n\n### Pound-for-Pound Analysis\n\nUser argument: \"Tier lists should consider cost into their rankings.\"\n\nExample: While geniplasty/bimax is top-tier for impact, rhinoplasty for a bulbous nose \"is a fraction of the cost\" so ranks higher on value basis.\n\n### Risk-Adjusted Returns\n\n| Procedure | Impact | Risk | Value Assessment |\n|-----------|--------|------|------------------|\n| Bimax | Very High | Moderate | High value IF indicated |\n| Rhinoplasty | High | Moderate | High value for obvious issues |\n| Orbital decompression | High | High (1/5 botch) | Lower value due to risk |\n| Fat grafting | Moderate | Low | Good value |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Accuracy & Reliability Concerns\n\n### User-Reported Issues with FaceIQ\n\n| Concern | Details |\n|---------|---------|\n| **Score inflation** | \"It heavily overrates if anything\" - some report subtracting 1.5 points |\n| **Landmark placement** | Incorrect placement leads to inflated scores |\n| **Feature limitations** | \"None of these apps take into account shape and tightness of each feature\" |\n| **Inconsistency** | Same user got scores from 4/10 to 6.29/10 depending on photo conditions |\n| **Deep-set eyes** | Tool requires guessing for hidden upper eyelids |\n| **Gonial angle mapping** | Difficult to accurately mark on photos |\n\n### Reliability Tips from Users\n\n1. Run 3-4 tests and exclude outliers\n2. Avoid 2x zoom (causes score deflation)\n3. Follow landmark placement instructions carefully\n4. Use consistent lighting and angle\n5. Consider scores as estimates, not absolutes\n\n---\n\n## 10. Morphing/Simulation Methodology\n\n### What FaceIQ Provides\n\n- Custom morph showing potential changes\n- Before/after comparison\n- Estimated score change with modifications\n\n### Technical Approach (Inferred)\n\n1. Identify facial features below ideal ratios\n2. Digitally adjust those features toward ideal values\n3. Recalculate harmony score on morphed image\n4. Calculate percentage improvement\n\n### Limitations\n\n- Morphs may not be surgically achievable\n- Example: \"probably lefort 1/2 or genio\" suggested for one morph, user clarified changes involved \"midface height and forehead height\" - not directly surgically addressable\n- Visual improvement may appear minimal despite large score improvement\n\n---\n\n## 11.

Here is a summary of the findings:\n\n## Research Summary: FaceIQ Treatment Recommendations & Potential Score Calculations\n\n### 1. How FaceIQ Calculates \"Your Potential\" Scores\n\nFaceIQ uses a four-component scoring system:\n\n| Category | Weight | Description |\n|----------|--------|-------------|\n| **HARM (Harmony)** | 32% | 27 facial proportions (jaw width, facial thirds, eye spacing) |\n| **DIMO (Dimorphism)** | 20% | 11 masculine/feminine characteristics |\n| **ANGU (Angularity)** | 20% | 9 facial definition measurements |\n| **MISC (Miscellaneous)** | 26% | 7 categories (skin, eyes, coloring, etc.) |\n\nThe final score applies a **balance penalty** (spread between highest/lowest scores * 0.5) to reward facial cohesion.\n\n### 2. Treatment Recommendations System\n\nFaceIQ Premium ($100) provides:\n- **Order of Operations**: Step-by-step surgical plan\n- **Custom morphs**: Visualized potential changes\n- **Estimated potential score**: Projected rating after treatments\n- Softmax and hardmax recommendations\n\n### 3. Improvement Percentage Estimates\n\n**Softmaxxing (Leanmaxxing example):**\n- Losing to 15% body fat: **+1.5 points overall**\n- Angularity subscale: +4 points\n- Harmony/Dimorphism: +1 point each\n\n**Morph examples:**\n- Top 26% harmony to Top 0.3% with nose/forehead adjustments of \"a couple mm\"\n\n### 4. Order of Operations for Procedures\n\nThe community-established sequence:\n1. **Skeletal foundation first**: Bimax/Le Fort I (if recessed)\n2. **Trimax**: Bimax + Genioplasty combined\n3. **Rhinoplasty**: After jaw settles (bimax widens nose)\n4. **Implants**: Jaw angle, cheek after skeletal work\n5. **Soft tissue**: Lip lifts, blepharoplasty last\n\n### 5. Hardmaxxing Tier List (ROI)\n\n**S-Tier (Best ROI):**\n- Otoplasty (safe, affordable)\n- Genioplasty (low cost, often covered by insurance)\n- Bimax/Trimax (transformative if indicated)\n- Hair transplant (minimal risk)\n\n**A-Tier:**\n- Rhinoplasty (high impact for obvious issues)\n- Fat grafting (low risk, permanent)\n- Canthoplasty\n\n**Key insight**: Cost should factor into ROI - rhinoplasty for bulbous nose is \"a fraction of the cost\" of bimax but can have similar visual impact.\n\n### 6. Softmax vs Hardmax Recommendations\n\n**Community consensus: 50-70% of looks potential comes from softmaxxing**\n\nPriority softmaxxes:\n1. Skincare (sunscreen, tretinoin) - \"most important softmax\"\n2. Leanmaxxing to 10-15% body fat\n3. Eyebrows - \"highest ROI softmax\"\n4. Mewing (more effective for younger users)\n\n**Hardmax only after:**\n- Completing all softmaxxing\n- Reaching genetic ceiling\n- Living with baseline appearance for years\n\n### 7. Accuracy Concerns\n\nUser-reported issues:\n- Scores may be inflated by 1-1.5 points\n- Landmark placement errors cause inaccurate scores\n- Inconsistency between sessions (4/10 to 6.29/10 for same user)\n- Tool doesn't account for \"shape and tightness of each feature\"\n\n**Tip**: Run 3-4 tests, exclude outliers, avoid 2x zoom\n\nThe complete research document is saved at:\n`/Users/imorgado/LOOKSMAXX/looksmaxx-app/docs/FACEIQ_TREATMENT_RESEARCH.md`"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4433,"cache_read_input_tokens":49201,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4433,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWHJE41sAiWKUcBGPcEGE","type":"assistant","uuid":"ae6a9235-ede6-4570-9677-8be0165733d8","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:21:05.027Z"}
