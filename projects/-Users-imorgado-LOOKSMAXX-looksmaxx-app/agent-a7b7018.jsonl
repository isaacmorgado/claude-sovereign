The goal is to achieve a lean, athletic appearance that enhances both physical proportions and facial aesthetics.\n\n### Target Body Fat Percentage\n\nGetting to around 10% bodyfat is considered ideal for facial aesthetics for most men.(no content)10% to 12% is considered ideal because extra fat that bloats your stomach or face is typically gone in this range.(no content)Many people are at 20%+ bodyfat (although they think they're 15%). The weight drop until about 15-18% really will not affect facial aesthetics in any drastic way.\n\n### Diet Protocols Discussed\n\n**Extreme Cutting Approaches:**\nOMAD or Warrior Diet (1-2 meals per day, no snacking), Strict Carnivore or Lean Keto (Grass-fed beef, eggs, salmon, no carbs), and high-protein, low-fat for faster fat loss (Chicken breast, lean steak, egg whites).(no content)No dairy (except butter/ghee) as dairy causes face bloat & water retention. No alcohol. No cheat meals. No sugar.\n\n**Debloating Methods:**\nCut ALL processed foods, ZERO carbs (or strict keto + carnivore) since carbs store water (3-4g water per 1g glycogen), massive hydration with electrolytes (3-4L water + sodium, potassium, magnesium daily), and infrared sauna or sweat sessions (30-45 min daily).\n\n### Practical Tips\n\nCardio doesn't burn nearly as many calories as lifting, but getting good at running or cycling can help the fat fly off. Some recommend cardio 7 days a week with sessions 1-1:30 hours long, potentially burning 1k+ calories.(no content)Stop eating out and decline invites to focus on training instead. Junk food will quickly ruin your facial aesthetics.\n\n### Facial Enhancement Additions\n\nSome protocols recommend mewing 24/7 (proper tongue posture), chewing hard gum (Mastic or Falim) 2-3 hours daily for jaw hypertrophy, neck training (weighted neck curls) to make your jawline pop, and facial fat burning massage (Gua Sha, ice rolling) to help tighten the skin.\n\n### Benefits\n\nReducing body fat can create hollow cheeks by eliminating puffiness in the mid-face area, a lower fat percentage reveals the natural contours of your jawline making it appear stronger and more defined, and as fat diminishes from the face, cheekbones become more pronounced.\n\nNote: The search results came primarily from Looksmax.org rather than Reddit, but they contain extensive community discussion about these protocols. Many of the extreme protocols discussed (including mentions of substances like GLP-1 agonists, DNP, etc.) carry significant health risks and should be approached with caution.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"64ff73e2-b500-4c00-8373-b623a35c87f2","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:29:13.951Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"leanmaxxing diet protocol cutting facial aesthetics reddit","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01TLN3FrdHEgBYuL9m1Yahty","content":[{"title":"The Ultimate Fat Loss Guide - Everything From BAM15 To \"Just Don't Eat Bro\" - The Truth About Leanmaxxing | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/the-ultimate-fat-loss-guide-everything-from-bam15-to-just-dont-eat-bro-the-truth-about-leanmaxxing.1430506/"},{"title":"Rate this leanmaxxing face fat burning protocol chatgpt made (drugs, potassium, etc) | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/rate-this-leanmaxxing-face-fat-burning-protocol-chatgpt-made-drugs-potassium-etc.1364331/"},{"title":"Gymmaxxing + Leanmaxxing Transformation | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/gymmaxxing-leanmaxxing-transformation.1123543/"},{"title":"Leanmaxxing Is MASSIVELY Underrated | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/leanmaxxing-is-massively-underrated.512917/"},{"title":"Title: Leanmaxxing: Guide to Achieving a Lean and Defined Physique – Mewinghub","url":"https://mewinghub.com/blogs/looksmaxing-blog/what-is-leanmaxxing-guide-to-looksmaxxing-through-a-lean-physiqu"},{"title":"What diet should i go on for leanmaxxing? | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/what-diet-should-i-go-on-for-leanmaxxing.462817/"},{"title":"Leanmaxxing tips for you guys | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/leanmaxxing-tips-for-you-guys.610832/"},{"title":"REMINDER: Being “lean” is pointless if you’re sub 5.5 (base), have no niche, or have shit insertions/frame.

In normal or neutral head posture, your ears line up with your shoulders and midline.(no content)For every inch of forward movement, there is an extra 10 pounds of weight placed on your neck.\n\n### Evidence-Based Exercises\nThere is \"Good\" to \"Excellent\" evidence from 3 level 1b randomized control trials to support the inclusion of a sternocleidomastoid stretch, pectoralis stretch, the supine chin tuck, and scapular retraction exercises into a corrective exercise program to address forward head posture.\n\n### Key Exercises\n\n**1. Chin Tucks**\nChin tucks are one of the most effective exercises for reversing forward head posture. They strengthen the deep cervical flexors in the front of your neck, helping to pull the head back into alignment.(no content)Keep your head straight and your chin parallel to the floor. Pull your chin back toward your chest, as though you're making a double chin. While your chin is tucked in, move the back of your head away from the base of your neck. Hold the position for three deep breaths.\n\n**2. Shoulder Blade Squeeze**\nThe shoulder blade squeeze strengthens the muscles between your shoulder blades, improving forward neck posture. Stand up straight with your arms at your sides. Squeeze your shoulder blades together. Hold for 5 seconds and release. Repeat 10 times.\n\n**3. Wall Exercises**\nStand with your upper back against a wall, feet shoulder-width apart. Face forward, tuck your chin down, and pull your head back until it meets the wall. Hold the stretch for 5 seconds before resting, and repeat 10 times.\n\n### Exercise Frequency\nUsing NASM recommendations for integration exercises, the client can perform 1-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions (using a slow and controlled duration of repetition), 3-5 days per week.\n\n### Timeline for Correction\nYou won't correct forward head posture overnight. Commit to these tips and see if you notice an improvement over the weeks and months ahead.(no content)The importance of consistency cannot be overstated when aiming for long-term improvements in posture. Regular practice ensures that muscles are consistently strengthened and stretched, promoting better alignment over time.(no content)To fix forward head posture, consistency is key.

In normal or neutral head posture, your ears line up with your shoulders and midline.(no content)For every inch of forward movement, there is an extra 10 pounds of weight placed on your neck.\n\n### Evidence-Based Exercises\nThere is \"Good\" to \"Excellent\" evidence from 3 level 1b randomized control trials to support the inclusion of a sternocleidomastoid stretch, pectoralis stretch, the supine chin tuck, and scapular retraction exercises into a corrective exercise program to address forward head posture.\n\n### Key Exercises\n\n**1. Chin Tucks**\nChin tucks are one of the most effective exercises for reversing forward head posture. They strengthen the deep cervical flexors in the front of your neck, helping to pull the head back into alignment.(no content)Keep your head straight and your chin parallel to the floor. Pull your chin back toward your chest, as though you're making a double chin. While your chin is tucked in, move the back of your head away from the base of your neck. Hold the position for three deep breaths.\n\n**2. Shoulder Blade Squeeze**\nThe shoulder blade squeeze strengthens the muscles between your shoulder blades, improving forward neck posture. Stand up straight with your arms at your sides. Squeeze your shoulder blades together. Hold for 5 seconds and release. Repeat 10 times.\n\n**3. Wall Exercises**\nStand with your upper back against a wall, feet shoulder-width apart. Face forward, tuck your chin down, and pull your head back until it meets the wall. Hold the stretch for 5 seconds before resting, and repeat 10 times.\n\n### Exercise Frequency\nUsing NASM recommendations for integration exercises, the client can perform 1-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions (using a slow and controlled duration of repetition), 3-5 days per week.\n\n### Timeline for Correction\nYou won't correct forward head posture overnight. Commit to these tips and see if you notice an improvement over the weeks and months ahead.(no content)The importance of consistency cannot be overstated when aiming for long-term improvements in posture. Regular practice ensures that muscles are consistently strengthened and stretched, promoting better alignment over time.(no content)To fix forward head posture, consistency is key. Regularly practising exercises designed to strengthen the neck and upper back muscles will contribute to realigning the head with the shoulders. Combine this with mindful posture habits to maximise the effectiveness of your efforts.\n\n### Effects and Consequences if Left Untreated\nSide effects of forward head posture include stiffness, fatigue, muscle spasms, unbalanced gait, decreased neck motion range, headaches and numbness in the arms and hands. If not corrected, long-term effects of forward head posture include osteoporosis, bulging spinal discs and cervical spine arthritis.\n\n### Jawline and Appearance\nThis type of posture can make one look unattractive and cause neck pain, upper back pain, along with tension-type headaches, as well as other symptoms.\n\nNote: The search results did not contain specific information about direct effects on the jawline appearance, though improving forward head posture generally improves overall facial profile and neck aesthetics by properly aligning the head over the shoulders."],"durationSeconds":26.947416583999992}}

Chewing Falim gum can stimulate the masseter muscles to some extent, contributing to muscle hypertrophy (growth) over time. However, Falim gum doesn't offer the level of resistance that might be optimal for significant masseter hypertrophy or palate expansion. Mastic gum, a natural resin, is a level up from Falim gum in terms of resistance, making it a superior choice for masseter hypertrophy.(no content)Falim may be a good starting point for beginners because it is softer than pure mastic gum. Before you \"work your way up\" to mastic gum, you could start by chewing Falim for a few weeks.\n\n### Recommended Protocols\n\nFor those starting out, the recommendation is 40 minutes of daily chewing. After this regimen, it's crucial to give yourself a break and take one day off per week. Adhere to this for at least three weeks before assessing progress.(no content)If you try mewing gum, begin by chewing it for about two to three hours each day. If your jaw begins to feel sore after a few days of chewing, take a break.(no content)Falim gum provides the resistance necessary for exercises of your jaw muscles, particularly the masseter. Stacking three to four pieces of Falim Gum gives adequate resistance, but beginners might have a different experience.\n\n### Scientific Evidence & Timeline\n\nA randomized controlled trial published in 2024 examined gum chewing effects:\n\nThe study was a prospective randomised controlled trial with 58 participants randomly assigned to training and control groups. The training group chewed gum three times a day for 6 months, while the control group received no training.(no content)The conclusion was that mastication training using gum increases maximum occlusal force due to an increase in occlusal contact area but has no effect on masseter muscle thickness (MMT) or mandibular shape.(no content)The researchers observed changes in the MMT and mandibular shape after gum chewing training, but found no changes in the MMT or mandibular shape in the training group and no significant differences between the training and control groups.\n\n### Precautions\n\nWhile mastic gum is effective for building the masseter muscle, over-chewing can stress your jaw joints and muscles. This could lead to tightness or tension in the muscles and the possibility of cramps. Make sure to stretch your jaw after you workout and don't chew for too many days in a row.(no content)Mastic gum is 10x harder than regular gum, which means it can be tough on your teeth and gums if you are sensitive.(no content)There's a recommended usage of 5 grams a day for mastic gum.\n\n### Important Note\n\nAccording to Healthline, chewing gum isn't likely to sharpen or define your jawline because the muscles used for chewing are largely in the neck and cheeks. Chewing gum won't make your jaw bigger or more muscular because most of the muscles used for chewing aren't in the jaw.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6b981506-1d01-44ba-a87d-3d965fb8af97","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:29:45.378Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"falim mastic gum chewing protocol masseter hypertrophy jaw results timeline","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Xmo3ZkFnCihRnB9fPw31Wp","content":[{"title":"Mewing Results - Mastic Gum Results - Sculpted Jawlines – Spartan Health™","url":"https://spartanhealth.io/pages/copy-of-results"},{"title":"Falim Gum vs Mastic Gum: The Impact on Masseter Hypertrophy and Palate Expansion – Spartan Health™","url":"https://spartanhealth.io/blogs/how-to-look-better-looksmaxxing/falim-gum-vs-mastic-gum-the-impact-on-masseter-hypertrophy-and-palate-expansion"},{"title":"Effects of gum chewing training on occlusal force, masseter muscle thickness and mandibular shape: A randomised controlled clinical trial - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39215439/"},{"title":"Does Chewing Gum Help Jawline?

The faces of sleep-deprived individuals were perceived as having more hanging eyelids, redder eyes, more swollen eyes and darker circles under the eyes. Sleep deprivation also was associated with paler skin, more wrinkles or fine lines, and more droopy corners of the mouth.\n\n### French Study on Sleep Restriction\nTwenty-four healthy good-sleeping women, aged 30–55, participated in a study where sleep restriction was limited to 3 hours per night for 2 consecutive nights.(no content)The survey showed that even a sleep restriction lasting two nights can significantly affect hydration, trans-epidermal water loss, reduced extensibility and elasticity, delayed extensibility, oxidation, and acidity of facial skin. Using photography, researchers observed a significant decrease in brightness and saturation, as well as an increase in dark circles under the eyes.\n\n## Mechanisms\n\nDuring deep sleep stages, the body goes into repair mode. It increases blood flow to the skin, allowing for greater oxygen and nutrient delivery. This is also when cell regeneration kicks into high gear, and collagen production rises—two critical factors for maintaining youthful, glowing skin.(no content)A lack of sleep also results in higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol breaks down collagen, further accelerating the aging process.\n\n## Puffiness and Swelling\nSleep-deprived individuals were perceived as having more swollen eyes, which relates to puffiness. Eye creams with caffeine can help constrict blood vessels, reducing the appearance of dark circles and puffiness.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"dd7ece99-8d32-467e-ad1e-05c68d9b9611","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:30:11.826Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"sleep quality facial appearance skin aging puffiness research study","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_019LdLGhntogob8NsAucjrMo","content":[{"title":"Does poor sleep quality affect skin ageing? - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25266053/"},{"title":"Sleep deprivation linked to aging skin, study suggests | ScienceDaily","url":"https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130723155002.htm"},{"title":"A study of skin characteristics with long-term sleep restriction in Korean women in their 40s - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31692145/"},{"title":"Does poor sleep quality affect skin ageing? - Oyetakin‐White - 2015 - Clinical and Experimental Dermatology - Wiley Online Library","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/ced.12455"},{"title":"Sleep quality may impact skin - Sleep Education","url":"https://sleepeducation.org/sleep-quality-may-impact-skin/"},{"title":"Study reveals the face of sleep deprivation - American Academy of Sleep Medicine – Association for Sleep Clinicians and Researchers","url":"https://aasm.org/study-reveals-the-face-of-sleep-deprivation/"},{"title":"The Connection Between Sleep and Skin Health | Skin And Cancer Institute","url":"https://skinandcancerinstitute.com/sleep-and-skin-health-connection/"},{"title":"The Impact of Sleep Quality on Skin Color - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC12622943/"},{"title":"“You look sleepy…” The impact of sleep restriction on skin parameters and facial appearance of 24 women - ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945721005761"},{"title":"Sleep (or lack of it) and Your Skin - Reviva Labs","url":"https://www.revivalabs.com/sleep-or-lack-of-it-and-your-skin/"}]},"Here are the research findings on sleep quality, facial appearance, skin aging, and puffiness:\n\n## Key Research Studies\n\n### University Hospitals Case Medical Center Study (Estée Lauder-commissioned)\nIn a first-of-its-kind clinical trial, physician-scientists at University Hospitals (UH) Case Medical Center found that sleep quality impacts skin function and aging.(no content)The study demonstrated that poor sleepers had increased signs of skin aging and slower recovery from a variety of environmental stressors, such as disruption of the skin barrier or ultraviolet (UV) radiation.(no content)The study involved 60 pre-menopausal women between the ages of 30 and 49, with half of participants falling into the poor quality sleep category.(no content)Using the SCINEXA skin aging scoring system, poor quality sleepers showed increased signs of intrinsic skin aging including fine lines, uneven pigmentation and slackening of skin and reduced elasticity.(no content)The average score in the good quality sleepers was 2.2 versus 4.4 in poor quality sleepers.(no content)The study concluded that chronic poor sleep quality is associated with increased signs of intrinsic ageing, diminished skin barrier function and lower satisfaction with appearance.\n\n### Stockholm University Study on Facial Appearance\nA study found that sleep deprivation affects facial features such as the eyes, mouth and skin.

This is also when cell regeneration kicks into high gear, and collagen production rises—two critical factors for maintaining youthful, glowing skin.(no content)A lack of sleep also results in higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol. Cortisol breaks down collagen, further accelerating the aging process.\n\n## Puffiness and Swelling\nSleep-deprived individuals were perceived as having more swollen eyes, which relates to puffiness. Eye creams with caffeine can help constrict blood vessels, reducing the appearance of dark circles and puffiness."],"durationSeconds":22.405413749992846}}

It is often used as a therapeutic exercise to help improve posture, alleviate neck pain, and reduce tension in the neck and shoulders.(no content)Chin tucking originates from the McKenzie chin tuck technique – developed by New Zealand physical therapist, Robin McKenzie. It was invented as a foundational treatment for eliminating back and neck pain and improving bad posture.\n\n## Benefits for Jawline and Posture\n\nChin tuck exercises can help your jawline. While chin tucks aren't a facial sculpting exercise, they can improve the look of your jawline by promoting better cervical posture. When your head is properly aligned and not jutting forward, your jaw and neck muscles are engaged and supported. This improved posture can reduce the appearance of a double chin caused by poor alignment, boosting your facial definition over time.(no content)Chin tucks work well for overall posture and help to fix forward head posture. When performing chin tucks regularly, your spine gets used to keeping the correct posture. At the same time, upper back and neck muscles stretch and strengthen.\n\n## Timeline for Results\n\nMost people begin to notice improved posture awareness within the first week. Physical changes like reduced double chin and better jawline definition typically become visible after 4-8 weeks of consistent practice. However, results vary based on individual factors such as age, initial condition, and consistency of practice.(no content)Chin tucks for neck pain relief usually work sooner, as deep neck muscle relaxation takes a few sessions of chin tucks. At the same time, visible results of chin tuck for facial shape improvement manifest after a couple of months of regular training.\n\n## How to Perform Chin Tucks\n\nSit upright with your head and shoulders in a relaxed neutral position, looking straight ahead. Glide your chin and head straight back. Your head shouldn't go up or down, and neither should your neck bend forward. You should feel a good stretch at the top of your neck and the base of your head. Hold this position for 5 seconds. Then bring the chin forward.(no content)The most effective way is to do 5-7 sessions of chin tucks every day. One session of 10 chin tucks 5 seconds each only takes a minute. So it's recommended to find up to 10 minutes per day to do chin tucks.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\nWhile chin tuck exercises can enhance muscular tone and contribute to improved posture, they alone are unlikely to significantly reduce fat deposits or tighten loose skin.(no content)Chin tuck exercises can significantly reduce the appearance of a double chin by strengthening the underlying muscles and improving posture. However, results depend on various factors including genetics, overall body composition, and age. For those with excess fat under the chin, combining exercises with overall weight management strategies will yield the best results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b6b513cb-f7e3-413b-871a-6ddbe4e3b553","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:30:15.616Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"neck exercises jawline chin tuck results before after posture","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01FNh8jHYkTENVfFTTmGg27W","content":[{"title":"Chin Tuck Exercise for Neck Pain: A Beginner-Friendly Fix","url":"https://backmusclesolutions.com/blogs/the-ql-blawg/chin-tuck-exercise"},{"title":"How Chin Tucks Benefit Your Neck, Jawline, and Overall Health","url":"https://www.victoriacosmeticsurgery.com/chin-tucks-benefit"},{"title":"Before After Chin Tuck | TikTok","url":"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/before-after-chin-tuck"},{"title":"McKenzie Chin Tuck Exercise: How To Do It (Video), Before & After, Side Effects","url":"https://www.mewing.app/blog/mckenzie-chin-tuck-exercise"},{"title":"Chin Tuck Exercise Before and After | TikTok","url":"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/chin-tuck-exercise-before-and-after?lang=en"},{"title":"Effective Chin Tuck Techniques to Reduce Face Fat","url":"https://how2losefacefat.com/face-exercises/chin-tuck/"},{"title":"Chin Tucking Exercises: Benefits and How-To Guide | Mewing.coach","url":"https://mewing.coach/blog/chin-tucking"},{"title":"How Effective Are Chin Tucks for Reducing Double Chins?","url":"https://www.victoriacosmeticsurgery.com/chin-tucks-effective"},{"title":"Chin Tucks Before and After | TikTok","url":"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/chin-tucks-before-and-after"},{"title":"Chin Tucking: Simple Exercises for Neck Pain Relief and Better Posture","url":"https://jawzrsize.com/blogs/blog/chin-tucking"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about chin tuck exercises and their effects on jawline, posture, and before/after results:\n\n## What Are Chin Tucks?\n\nThe chin tuck exercise (also called McKenzie Chin Tuck) is a simple neck exercise that involves pulling your chin straight back, creating a double chin.

The mastication muscles targeted by these exercises do not directly affect submental fat or skin elasticity.(no content)In a study where two individuals used a commercially available jaw exerciser for approximately three months following instructions, neither case reported noticeable changes in jaw appearance based on subjective measurements.(no content)The findings suggest that jaw exercising products may have limited efficacy in achieving advertised results for facial contouring.\n\n## Expert Opinions\n\n\"There is no evidence that this does anything,\" said one dental expert. \"We practice evidence-based dentistry first and foremost and we use evidence for what is going to happen in the face.\"(no content)Building the jaw muscle (masseter hypertrophy) can be achieved with the Jawzrsize. However, experts warned that this kind of parafunctional, abnormal jaw activity can actually be detrimental in many ways.(no content)Parafunctional activities, like chewing gum or using a Jawzrsize, increase the strain on the face and jaw. These should actually be avoided because they have the potential to lead to the development of jaw problems including tension headaches, jaw clicking and popping, and injury to the temporomandibular joint (TMJ).\n\n## What It May Actually Do\n\nThe device may help strengthen the jaw muscles. An older study evaluating a similar silicone bite device found that it did increase maximum bite force and endurance. However, after participants stopped training, the results rapidly disappeared.(no content)Using the Jawzrsize may lead to some enlargement (hypertrophy) of the masseter muscles. However, while it may help strengthen the jaw, it is unlikely to provide other benefits. The chewing muscles do not tone or rejuvenate the face—they are simply the muscles involved in chewing, and exercising them is not likely to alter a person's face substantially.\n\n## User Reviews\n\nSome users on Trustpilot report positive experiences, with one stating they've \"used this product for 9 months now and I've seen damn good results! Absolutely improved jaw line.\"(no content)Results vary among users—not everyone gets the same results, but people who use it regularly tend to see more progress.\n\n## Potential Risks\n\nOverdoing it with Jawzrsize can lead to pain in the jaw, temporomandibular disorders, and an over-defined jawline. You might also strain or dislocate your jaw joint and muscles.(no content)Chewing can stimulate increased stomach acid production. Non-nutritive chewing \"is a problem for the GI system, and can cause gastritis, acid reflux, and stomach upset problems.\"\n\n## Summary\n\nThe scientific consensus suggests Jawzrsize may strengthen jaw muscles but is unlikely to deliver the dramatic facial contouring results advertised.

Its size varies between individuals and is largely determined by genetics, which is why even people at a healthy weight can feel their cheeks are overly full or rounded.(no content)Some people have prominent \"chipmunk cheeks\" while others naturally have hollow cheekbones due to several factors. Genetics is the primary driver of your buccal fat appearance.(no content)Even very fit individuals might still have chubby cheeks because this particular fat deposit doesn't respond to diet or exercise. It's simply genetics at play.\n\n### Natural Facial Hollowing and Aging\n\nAs we enter middle age (40s-50s), most people experience a natural decrease in buccal fat volume, and by our 60s and beyond, further reduction contributes to the hollowing that characterizes aging faces. This natural timeline explains why timing matters so much for buccal fat removal. Remove too early, and you might accelerate the hollowing that would happen naturally later in life.(no content)While some fat compartments in the face diminish naturally with age, buccal fat does not typically disappear entirely on its own. The reduction in buccal fat is usually gradual and relative, meaning it lessens in volume but rarely vanishes completely.\n\n### Leanmaxxing Perspective\n\nSome individuals have low set cheekbones, a wide face and high buccal fat storage. This kind of fat inside the mouth is genetic and even with prolonged \"debloating\" efforts, they cannot get rid of that buccal fat unless surgically removed.(no content)Some individuals have a lot of face fat despite having a lean body. Although they may lose some baby chubbiness over time, buccal fat pads and genetics can mean no matter what they do, they cannot get rid of it without surgery.\n\n### Risks of Buccal Fat Removal\n\nOne of the most frequent regrets reported globally is undergoing buccal fat removal too early in life, leading to premature facial hollowing.(no content)Having some buccal fat is actually beneficial as you age. Our faces naturally lose volume over time, and those who have their buccal fat completely removed sometimes develop a hollow, gaunt appearance years later.(no content)Proper technique and conservative fat removal are essential to avoid long-term hollowing or premature aging.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"d39246f1-0d45-4be7-9748-3a0eac93c850","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:30:43.926Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"buccal fat\" genetics facial hollowing leanmaxxing natural","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_019kzTokEKvmhrsGhTTxpGXG","content":[{"title":"What Is Buccal Fat Removal?

Its size varies between individuals and is largely determined by genetics, which is why even people at a healthy weight can feel their cheeks are overly full or rounded.(no content)Some people have prominent \"chipmunk cheeks\" while others naturally have hollow cheekbones due to several factors. Genetics is the primary driver of your buccal fat appearance.(no content)Even very fit individuals might still have chubby cheeks because this particular fat deposit doesn't respond to diet or exercise. It's simply genetics at play.\n\n### Natural Facial Hollowing and Aging\n\nAs we enter middle age (40s-50s), most people experience a natural decrease in buccal fat volume, and by our 60s and beyond, further reduction contributes to the hollowing that characterizes aging faces. This natural timeline explains why timing matters so much for buccal fat removal. Remove too early, and you might accelerate the hollowing that would happen naturally later in life.(no content)While some fat compartments in the face diminish naturally with age, buccal fat does not typically disappear entirely on its own. The reduction in buccal fat is usually gradual and relative, meaning it lessens in volume but rarely vanishes completely.\n\n### Leanmaxxing Perspective\n\nSome individuals have low set cheekbones, a wide face and high buccal fat storage. This kind of fat inside the mouth is genetic and even with prolonged \"debloating\" efforts, they cannot get rid of that buccal fat unless surgically removed.(no content)Some individuals have a lot of face fat despite having a lean body. Although they may lose some baby chubbiness over time, buccal fat pads and genetics can mean no matter what they do, they cannot get rid of it without surgery.\n\n### Risks of Buccal Fat Removal\n\nOne of the most frequent regrets reported globally is undergoing buccal fat removal too early in life, leading to premature facial hollowing.(no content)Having some buccal fat is actually beneficial as you age. Our faces naturally lose volume over time, and those who have their buccal fat completely removed sometimes develop a hollow, gaunt appearance years later.(no content)Proper technique and conservative fat removal are essential to avoid long-term hollowing or premature aging."],"durationSeconds":23.32965020799637}}

A larger deficit (750-1000 calories/day) may be appropriate for those with higher body fat percentages (men >25%, women >32%).\n\n## Protein Requirements During a Cut\n\nDuring a cutting diet, protein is by far the most crucial macronutrient. As long as you track your calories and protein intake, you can let your carbs and fat fluctuate daily and still get great results.(no content)You need to up your protein intake to protect your muscles during a cut. A recent review found that athletes like bodybuilders need 2.3 to 3.1 grams of protein per kilogram (1 to 1.4 grams per pound) of lean body mass per day. The leaner you are, the higher your protein intake should be within that range.(no content)For cutting, protein intake should be approximately 1g per pound (2.2 g/kg) of target body weight.(no content)Higher protein intake during a caloric deficit serves multiple crucial purposes: muscle preservation (when in a caloric deficit, your body may break down muscle tissue for energy), and increased satiety (protein is the most filling macronutrient, helping control hunger).\n\n## Macro Ratios for Cutting\n\nFor weight loss, one common macro ratio is 40/40/20 (carbohydrates/protein/fats).(no content)Bodybuilding cut macros tend to be between 40-50% protein, 10-30% carbohydrates, and 30-40% fat.(no content)A recommended split includes: Protein at 1g per pound of bodyweight (essential for muscle preservation), Fat at 25-30% of total calories (important for hormone production), and Carbs making up the remaining calories (provides energy for training).\n\n## Why Protein Matters During a Deficit\n\nWhile many people think you should have more protein in a bulk and less in a cut, the opposite is true. While protein plays a vital role in building muscle, it plays an even more essential role in maintaining muscle.(no content)In an energy deficit, the body relies more heavily on protein for fuel. With less carbohydrate and fat coming in during a deficit, the body leans more on protein to meet its energy demands.(no content)Protein also has a high thermic effect of food, meaning it takes a lot of energy to break down, which is great during a cutting phase.\n\n## Fat Intake During Cutting\n\nThe recommended amount of fat can be anywhere from 20% to 30% of your daily calories. Towards the end of cutting, fat intake might drop below this recommended amount for a small time because calories are low and protein needs to be kept high to maintain muscle.(no content)Fats are essential too.

Developed by Professor Mike Mew as part of the Orthotropics approach, this method includes exercises designed to improve the posture of the face and mouth.\n\n## Proper Mewing Tongue Posture Technique\n\nThe optimal position for mewing involves: the tongue's tip rests lightly against the roof of the mouth, just behind the front teeth (not touching them), while the middle and back of the tongue gently press against the entire palate.(no content)The mewing technique can be done in easy steps: Close your mouth, seal your lips, and allow your teeth to touch gently. Move your tongue to the roof of the mouth and lightly press it.(no content)One of the most effective methods to achieve proper tongue placement is the \"NG\" technique. Ensure your lips are sealed and you breathe through the nose, then articulate the words \"king\", \"sing\", and \"ring\" stressing the NG sound.\n\n## Age Limit and Adults\n\nWhen it comes to mewing – the age limit does not exist! Mewing effects can be observed at any life stage.(no content)There's no age limit for mewing – it's a technique that can benefit you at any stage of life. However, children tend to experience the most significant advantages from mewing.(no content)After the age of 25, you can expect changes only in the soft tissues (double chin, jaw muscles, soft palate).(no content)While mewing is most effective during the developmental years of childhood and adolescence, adults can also benefit from practicing proper tongue posture. Although changes in facial structure may be less dramatic in adults, improvements in dental alignment, breathing, and overall oral health are still possible.(no content)Scientific evidence is limited — mewing may improve breathing and posture but won't reshape adult bone structure.\n\n## Results Timeline\n\nMost beginners notice improved breathing and posture within 2-4 weeks. Facial structure changes typically become visible after 3-6 months of consistent practice.(no content)If you start mewing as an adult, you'll undoubtedly see changes – but they won't follow immediately. The progress will be gradual since adults have a slower metabolism and harder-to-grow muscles. But everything is achievable with determination.\n\n## Safety Considerations\n\nAccording to experts, you shouldn't attempt hard mewing if you're under 18 because soft mewing is sufficiently adequate for soft bones.(no content)Soft mewing uses gentle, sustainable pressure and can be maintained throughout the day. Hard mewing involves intense pressure for short periods and should only be done by experienced practitioners.(no content)Mewing is safe if done gently and correctly. Avoid pressing your tongue too forcefully, as this may cause jaw strain, misalignment, or TMJ discomfort.

Body Fat Percentage Targets\n\n### Scientific Evidence\n\nResearch indicates that body fat percentage has a significant impact on facial attractiveness, with studies showing people can detect BMI changes as small as 1.3 kg/m2 in male faces from facial cues alone.\n\n**Men:**\n- **Optimal range: 10-15% body fat**\n- Peak attractiveness at approximately **12% body fat** according to [Frontiers in Psychology research](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02658/full)\n- Studies predict optimal BMI of 23-25, corresponding to 12-15% body fat - \"not shredded, not bulky - just healthy and athletic looking\"\n- At 10-12%, facial definition becomes pronounced (hollow cheeks, defined jawline, visible cheekbones)\n\n**Women:**\n- Lower fat mass is preferred for attractiveness compared to what is considered healthy\n- Body fat percentage is a strong cue for attractiveness\n- Observers consistently prefer leaner female body compositions\n\n**Key insight from [PMC research](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6308207/):** Facial adiposity shows a curvilinear relationship with attractiveness - there is an optimal point, and being too lean can also reduce attractiveness.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Diet Protocols for Cutting\n\n### Calorie Deficit Guidelines\n\n| Starting Body Fat | Daily Deficit | Weekly Fat Loss |\n|-------------------|---------------|-----------------|\n| >25% (men) / >32% (women) | 750-1000 calories | 1.5-2 lbs |\n| 15-25% (men) / 20-32% (women) | 500 calories | 1 lb |\n| <12% (men) / <20% (women) | 250-300 calories | 0.5 lb |\n\nSource: [StrengthLog Macros for Cutting](https://www.strengthlog.com/macros-for-cutting/)\n\n### Macro Ratios for Cutting\n\n**Recommended split from [Ripped Body](https://rippedbody.com/macros/):**\n- **Protein:** 1-1.4g per pound of lean body mass (higher end for leaner individuals)\n- **Fat:** 25-30% of total calories\n- **Carbohydrates:** Remaining calories\n\n**Why protein is critical during a deficit:**\n- Muscle preservation becomes paramount\n- Higher thermic effect increases calorie burn\n- Body relies more heavily on protein for fuel in a deficit\n- Increased satiety helps control hunger\n\n### Popular Cutting Protocols\n\n**OMAD (One Meal A Day):**\n- Easier calorie tracking\n- Reduces blood sugar spikes\n- Studies show greater body fat loss vs. 3 meals/day\n- Typical results: 7-11 lbs in 10 weeks\n- **Drawback:** Difficult for weight training, 65% dropout rate\n\n**16:8 Intermittent Fasting:**\n- More sustainable than OMAD\n- Maintain eating window of 8 hours\n- Can help reduce facial bloating within 1-2 weeks\n\nSource: [Healthline OMAD](https://www.healthline.com/health/one-meal-a-day)\n\n### Looksmax Community Protocol (Extreme)\n\nFrom [Looksmax.org](https://looksmax.org/threads/the-ultimate-fat-loss-guide-everything-from-bam15-to-just-dont-eat-bro-the-truth-about-leanmaxxing.1430506/):\n- No dairy (causes facial bloat/water retention)\n- No alcohol\n- No sugar\n- No processed foods\n- Carnivore or strict keto (no/minimal carbs)\n- High protein, low fat for faster results\n\n**Warning:** Extreme protocols carry health risks and should be approached with caution.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Water Retention Reduction\n\n### The Sodium-Potassium Balance\n\nThe key to facial debloating is balancing electrolytes. Sodium causes water retention; potassium helps flush excess sodium.\n\n**From [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/face-bloating-morning):**\n- High sodium meals cause the body to hold onto water, especially in the face\n- Potassium counteracts sodium effects\n- Results visible within a few days of proper electrolyte balance\n\n### Recommended Potassium Intake\n\n- **Target:** 2,500-3,400 mg daily from whole foods\n- Supplements are less effective than whole foods\n- High-dose supplements require medical supervision\n\n**Best potassium sources:**\n- Baked potatoes with skin\n- Sweet potatoes\n- Bananas\n- Avocados\n- Spinach\n- Leafy greens\n\nSource: [Mewinghub Debloating Guide](https://mewinghub.com/blogs/looksmaxing-blog/facial-debloating-guide-how-to-keep-your-face-defined-and-chiseled)\n\n### Additional Debloating Strategies\n\n1. **Hydration:** 3-4L water daily (counterintuitive but prevents water retention)\n2. **Reduce alcohol and caffeine**\n3. **Manage stress and improve sleep** (cortisol increases water retention)\n4. **Cold compress:** Temporarily constricts blood vessels\n5. **Facial massage/jade roller:** Stimulates lymphatic drainage\n6. **Limit carbohydrates:** Carbs store 3-4g water per 1g glycogen\n\n---\n\n## 4. Facial Exercises\n\n### Mewing (Proper Tongue Posture)\n\n**What it is:** Resting the entire tongue (including posterior third) against the roof of the mouth.\n\n**Technique from [Mewing.app](https://www.mewing.app/blog/mewing-guide):**\n1. Close mouth, seal lips\n2. Teeth touch gently (not clenched)\n3. Tongue tip behind front teeth (not touching)\n4. Middle and back of tongue pressed against palate\n5. Breathe through nose\n\n**The \"NG\" technique:** Say \"king,\" \"sing,\" \"ring\" - the NG position is correct tongue placement.\n\n**Age limitations from [Mewing.coach](https://mewing.coach/blog/too-old-for-mewing):**\n- Most effective ages 5-10 (bones still growing)\n- Adolescents: Still beneficial but less dramatic\n- Adults 18-25: Soft tissue changes possible\n- **Adults 25+: Changes limited to soft tissues only** (double chin reduction, muscle tone)\n- No scientific evidence for adult bone remodeling\n\n**Expected timeline:**\n- Improved breathing/posture: 2-4 weeks\n- Visible soft tissue changes: 3-6 months\n- Bone structure changes (children only): 6-24+ months\n\nSource: [WebMD Mewing](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/what-is-mewing)\n\n### Hard Gum Chewing (Falim/Mastic)\n\n**Purpose:** Masseter muscle hypertrophy for wider jaw appearance\n\n**2024 Scientific Study from [Wiley Journal of Oral Rehabilitation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joor.13830):**\n- 58 participants, 6 months of gum chewing (3x daily)\n- **Result:** Increased occlusal force but **NO significant change in masseter muscle thickness or mandibular shape**\n- Changes disappeared rapidly after stopping\n\n**Progression from [Spartan Health](https://spartanhealth.io/blogs/how-to-look-better-looksmaxxing/falim-gum-vs-mastic-gum-the-impact-on-masseter-hypertrophy-and-palate-expansion):**\n1. **Beginners:** Start with Falim gum (softer)\n2. **Intermediate:** Progress to mastic gum (10x harder than regular gum)\n3. **Resistance:** Stack 3-4 pieces of Falim or 5g mastic\n\n**Protocol:**\n- Start: 40 minutes daily\n- Progress to: 2-3 hours daily\n- Rest: 1 day off per week\n- Duration: Minimum 3 weeks before assessing\n\n**Risks:**\n- TMJ disorders\n- Jaw tension/cramps\n- Tooth/gum sensitivity\n- Gastritis (excessive chewing stimulates stomach acid)\n\n### Jawzrsize\n\n**Scientific verdict from [PMC study 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11681191/):**\n- Limited evidence for facial contouring\n- May strengthen jaw muscles but unlikely to reduce double chin or tighten skin\n- Two participants using device for 3 months showed no noticeable changes\n\n**Expert warnings from [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/does-jawzrsize-really-work):**\n- Parafunctional jaw activity can be detrimental\n- Risk of TMJ problems, tension headaches, jaw clicking\n- Results rapidly disappear after stopping\n\n---\n\n## 5. Posture Correction\n\n### Forward Head Posture (FHP) Effects\n\nFrom [NASM](https://blog.nasm.org/fixing-forward-head-posture):\n- Every inch of forward head position = 10 extra pounds of neck strain\n- Causes neck pain, headaches, muscle spasms\n- Makes jawline appear less defined\n- Long-term: osteoporosis, bulging discs, cervical arthritis\n\n### Evidence-Based Exercises\n\n**Supported by [PubMed research](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35172275/):**\n1. Sternocleidomastoid stretch\n2. Pectoralis stretch\n3. Supine chin tuck\n4. Scapular retraction exercises\n\n### Key Exercises with Instructions\n\n**1. Chin Tucks (Most Important)**\nFrom [Healthline](https://www.healthline.com/health/bone-health/forward-head-posture):\n- Sit/stand with head straight, chin parallel to floor\n- Pull chin back toward chest (create double chin)\n- Move back of head away from base of neck\n- Hold 5 seconds, 10 repetitions\n- **Frequency:** 5-7 sessions daily (10 reps each)\n\n**2. Wall Angels**\n- Stand with upper back against wall\n- Face forward, tuck chin\n- Pull head back until it meets wall\n- Hold 5 seconds, repeat 10 times\n\n**3. Shoulder Blade Squeeze**\n- Stand straight, arms at sides\n- Squeeze shoulder blades together\n- Hold 5 seconds, release\n- Repeat 10 times\n\n### Timeline for Correction\n\nFrom [Back Intelligence](https://backintelligence.com/how-to-fix-forward-head-posture/):\n- **Posture awareness:** 1-2 weeks\n- **Reduced double chin appearance:** 4-8 weeks\n- **Significant structural improvement:** Months of consistent practice\n\n**Frequency:** 1-3 sets of 10-15 reps, 3-5 days per week\n\n---\n\n## 6. Sleep Optimization\n\n### Scientific Evidence\n\n**University Hospitals Case Medical Center Study** (from [ScienceDaily](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130723155002.htm)):\n- 60 women studied\n- Poor sleepers scored 4.4 on skin aging scale vs. 2.2 for good sleepers\n- Poor sleep = increased fine lines, uneven pigmentation, reduced elasticity\n- Poor sleep = slower recovery from skin damage\n\n**Stockholm University Study** (from [AASM](https://aasm.org/study-reveals-the-face-of-sleep-deprivation/)):\n\nSleep deprivation facial effects:\n- Hanging eyelids\n- Redder eyes\n- More swollen/puffy eyes\n- Darker circles under eyes\n- Paler skin\n- More wrinkles/fine lines\n- Droopy corners of mouth\n\n**French Study on 24 women** (from [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389945721005761)):\n- Just 2 nights of 3-hour sleep caused:\n  - Decreased skin hydration\n  - Reduced elasticity\n  - Increased oxidation\n  - Decreased brightness\n  - Darker under-eye circles\n\n### Why Sleep Matters for Face\n\nFrom [Skin and Cancer Institute](https://skinandcancerinstitute.com/sleep-and-skin-health-connection/):\n- Deep sleep = repair mode\n- Increased blood flow to skin\n- Peak collagen production\n- Cell regeneration\n- Lack of sleep = elevated cortisol = collagen breakdown\n\n### Sleep Optimization Protocol\n\n**For facial aesthetics:**\n1. **Duration:** 7-9 hours consistently\n2. **Quality:** Deep sleep stages are critical\n3. **Timing:** Consistent sleep/wake schedule\n4. **Environment:** Dark, cool room\n5. **Avoid:** Alcohol, caffeine, screens before bed\n6. **Position:** Sleeping on back reduces facial compression/wrinkles\n\n---\n\n## 7. Important Genetic Considerations\n\n### Buccal Fat\n\nFrom [Looksmax.org](https://looksmax.org/threads/leanmaxxing-doesnt-work-for-some-people.1357767/) and [medical sources](https://www.donyoomd.com/blog/2025/04/23/what-is-buccal-fat-removal-everything-you-need-to-know-about-this-facial-slimming-procedure/):\n\n- Buccal fat is **deeper than subcutaneous fat**\n- **Cannot be targeted through diet or exercise**\n- Size determined primarily by genetics\n- Even very lean individuals may have prominent cheeks\n- Natural reduction occurs in 40s-50s\n- Only surgical removal can eliminate it\n\n**Takeaway:** If you're lean (10-12% body fat) and still have chubby cheeks, it may be genetic buccal fat, not a diet issue.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Complete Protocol with Timelines\n\n### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)\n\n| Action | Frequency | Expected Result |\n|--------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Calculate TDEE, set 500 cal deficit | Daily tracking | Weight loss begins |\n| Set protein at 1g/lb bodyweight | Every meal | Muscle preservation |\n| Begin mewing (proper tongue posture) | 24/7 | Improved breathing |\n| Chin tucks | 5-7x daily, 10 reps | Posture awareness |\n| Sleep 7-9 hours | Nightly | Reduced puffiness |\n| Increase potassium-rich foods | Daily | Reduced facial bloating |\n\n### Phase 2: Intensification (Weeks 5-12)\n\n| Action | Frequency | Expected Result |\n|--------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Maintain caloric deficit | Daily | Approaching 12-15% BF |\n| Add Falim gum chewing | 40 min daily | Jaw muscle engagement |\n| Full posture routine | 3-5x weekly | Improved head position |\n| Reduce sodium, increase potassium | Daily | Visible facial definition |\n| Optional: 16:8 intermittent fasting | Daily | Accelerated fat loss |\n\n### Phase 3: Optimization (Months 3-6+)\n\n| Action | Frequency | Expected Result |\n|--------|-----------|-----------------|\n| Reach target body fat (10-15%) | Ongoing | Maximum facial definition |\n| Progress to mastic gum | 2-3 hours daily | Potential masseter development |\n| Maintain proper tongue posture | Habitual | Soft tissue improvements |\n| Consistent sleep optimization | Nightly | Skin quality improvements |\n\n---\n\n## 9. Summary: What Actually Works\n\n### Strong Evidence\n- **Body fat reduction to 10-15%** - Most impactful for facial aesthetics\n- **Sleep quality** - Documented effects on facial appearance\n- **Posture correction** - Improves profile and reduces double chin appearance\n- **Sodium/potassium balance** - Reduces water retention and bloating\n\n### Moderate Evidence\n- **Intermittent fasting** - Effective for fat loss\n- **Chin tucks** - Improves neck posture and can reduce double chin appearance\n\n### Weak/No Scientific Evidence\n- **Mewing for adults** - May improve breathing/posture; no bone changes after 25\n- **Gum chewing for jaw growth** - 2024 study showed no masseter hypertrophy\n- **Jawzrsize** - Limited evidence; potential for harm\n\n### Genetic Limitations\n- Buccal fat cannot be reduced through diet/exercise\n- Bone structure is fixed in adults\n- Individual response to leanmaxxing varies\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Facial Adiposity, Attractiveness, and Health: A Review - PMC](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6308207/)\n- [The Influence of Body Composition Effects on Male Facial Masculinity and Attractiveness - Frontiers](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02658/full)\n- [Men's Health - Most Attractive Body Fat Percentage](https://www.menshealth.com/uk/weight-loss/a69630837/male-body-type-rated-most-attractive-study/)\n- [WebMD - Mewing and Jawline Exercises](https://www.webmd.com/oral-health/what-is-mewing)\n- [Mewing Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewing_(orthotropics))\n- [Looksmax.org - Ultimate Fat Loss Guide](https://looksmax.org/threads/the-ultimate-fat-loss-guide-everything-from-bam15-to-just-dont-eat-bro-the-truth-about-leanmaxxing.1430506/)\n- [Mewinghub - Leanmaxxing Guide](https://mewinghub.com/blogs/looksmaxing-blog/what-is-leanmaxxing-guide-to-looksmaxxing-through-a-lean-physiqu)\n- [Healthline - Facial Bloating Foods](https://www.healthline.com/health/food-nutrition/face-bloating-morning)\n- [Mewinghub - Potassium and Facial Bloat](https://mewinghub.com/blogs/mewing-transformations/potassium-gluconate-facial-bloat)\n- [Spartan Health - Falim vs Mastic Gum](https://spartanhealth.io/blogs/how-to-look-better-looksmaxxing/falim-gum-vs-mastic-gum-the-impact-on-masseter-hypertrophy-and-palate-expansion)\n- [2024 Gum Chewing Clinical Trial - Wiley](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/joor.13830)\n- [PMC - Jawzrsize Efficacy Study 2024](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11681191/)\n- [Healthline - Forward Head Posture](https://www.healthline.com/health/bone-health/forward-head-posture)\n- [NASM - Fixing Forward Head Posture](https://blog.nasm.org/fixing-forward-head-posture)\n- [PubMed - Sleep and Skin Aging](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25266053/)\n- [ScienceDaily - Sleep Deprivation and Aging Skin](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/07/130723155002.htm)\n- [AASM - Face of Sleep Deprivation](https://aasm.org/study-reveals-the-face-of-sleep-deprivation/)\n- [StrengthLog - Macros for Cutting](https://www.strengthlog.com/macros-for-cutting/)\n- [Ripped Body - Macro Setting](https://rippedbody.com/macros/)\n- [Mewing.app - Complete Guide](https://www.mewing.app/blog/mewing-guide)\n- [Mewing.coach - Age Limits](https://mewing.coach/blog/too-old-for-mewing)\n- [WeFast - Intermittent Fasting Face Fat](https://www.wefast.care/articles/how-to-get-rid-of-face-fat)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1226,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1460,"cache_read_input_tokens":28529,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1460,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWHK36UWQpj7jiHcgPKLk","type":"assistant","uuid":"e3712c95-5136-4ad5-b150-a1fb764e3b97","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:33:07.574Z"}
