That total cost averages around $8,500 to $9,500.\n- The average cost of jaw implants depends on whether it's a custom implant or regular implant. The average range is from $8,000 to $15,000.\n\n### Custom Jaw Implants\n- The custom approach uses a one-piece implant that is made off of a 3D CT scan taken from the patient. It is completely customized to the patient's jaw anatomy and aesthetic desires. That total cost is in the range of about $15,000.\n- A custom jawline implant that includes the entire jawline from chin back to the jaw angles will cost in the range of $12,000 to $14,000 for all costs involved.\n- Custom-fit chin implants are personalized implants made using 3D imaging and molds of the patient's chin and jawline. They offer the most precise fit and contour. Custom implants are smart for patients with unique facial features. Costs start at $3,400 but vary based on your treatment plan.\n\n## Custom vs. Standard: Key Differences\n\nPrefabricated jaw implants are limited in the changes they can make. They by nature cannot be created with the patient's unique facial structure in mind. A prefabricated implant is more difficult to manipulate in terms of the shape of the face. This is particularly a concern for patients seeking reconstructive work following trauma, previous surgery/implants or serious facial injury.(no content)In contrast, custom-made jaw implants resolve these issues. Since each implant is made according to patient specifications and balanced with precision computer software, the final results can be incredibly close to what you envisioned and are contoured to the underlying bone.\n\n## Factors Affecting Cost\nPrices vary greatly because the surgery itself encompasses a wide range of techniques that can be performed to different extents. The recommendation is to first find the most qualified surgeons where you want the surgery performed that are board certified by the American Board of Plastic Surgery.(no content)Your individual quote will include the surgeon's fee, anesthesia costs, facility fees for the operating room and all other supplies and implants needed. Your fees also include all your follow-up appointments.(no content)Prices tend to be higher in major metro areas on the East and West coasts.\n\n## Insurance Coverage\nElective chin augmentation isn't covered by health insurance. But reconstructive cases may receive partial or full coverage.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"92dc0d5e-71a9-4fe9-b4e6-be4d1ad39cea","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:29:07.009Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"jaw angle implants custom vs standard cost surgeons 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_018G8qkMiJnmknNpKt96dRXc","content":[{"title":"Average Cost of a Chin Implant in 2024","url":"https://www.burbankplasticsurgery.com/blog/average-cost-chin-implant"},{"title":"How much would a custom jaw and chin implant cost?

The most commonly used materials are microporous high-density polyethylene (Medpor) and silicone implants.(no content)A wide range of alloplastic implant materials are used for facial augmentation, of which titanium, porous polyethylene (MedPor), polyether-ether-ketone (PEEK), silicone, and poly-methyl methacrylate (PMMA) are among the most used materials.\n\n## Silicone Implants\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Silicone is a flexible material that can be placed through smaller incisions and acquires the feel of bone when the backing on which it rests is bone.\n- Silicone has been and will always be a material made for the cosmetic surgery market which has always been cost sensitive.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Silicone presents migration, bony resorption, and visibility issues.\n- The silicone group had a higher incidence of infections and displacements compared to Medpor in one literature review.\n\n## Medpor (Porous Polyethylene) Implants\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Polyethylene, particularly porous polyethylene (MedPor), was reported to have one of the lowest infection rates while it becomes incorporated into the host.\n- Medpor complications for similar locations as silicone implants (malar, chin, mandible) showed only 0.7% infections, 5% need for removal or reoperation.\n- Medpor gets the most robust tissue ingrowth which occurs due to its surface porosity.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- Removal of porous implants such as MedPor is much more difficult compared to silicone implants due to the ingrowth of the host's connective tissue.\n- Medpor had a rate of 3.9% for undesired prominence (vs. only 1.4% for silicone implants).\n- Medpor implant removal becomes the most difficult in the jawline area due to the proximity of nerves and blood vessels, with risk of injury to the sensory mental nerve and motor marginal mandibular nerve.\n\n## PEEK (Polyether-Ether-Ketone) Implants\n\n**Advantages:**\n- PEEK is commonly employed for cranial vault reconstruction, spine surgery, and facial augmentation due to its inherent high mechanical strength, low interference with CT/MRI imaging modalities (radiographically translucent), and excellent biocompatibility.\n- PEEK is highly resistant to wear and tear, making it a long-lasting solution. Despite being lightweight, PEEK provides excellent structural support.\n- Compared to silicone implants, PEEK implants are considered more biocompatible and lower the risk of infection, inflammation, and rejection.\n\n**Disadvantages:**\n- A rigid implant like PEEK requires wide open incisional access or, at the least, longer incisions and a much bigger implant pocket.\n- Custom designing of a PEEK implant is far more expensive than that of other materials like silicone, often being 2X to 3X more expensive.\n- In the U.S. there is a major cost difference between PEEK and silicone for custom implant manufacture. PEEK has its origins in the reconstructive surgery market where costs are considerably higher by a factor of 3X to 4X.\n\n## Key Clinical Considerations\n\nThere are a variety of materials for custom facial implants including solid silicone, Omnipore/Medpor, PEEK, PEKK, and titanium—each with their own advantages and disadvantages. To the body, an implant is an implant; no material offers any different or superior biologic benefit. What separates these facial implant materials is not their biologic responses but other features such as cost, design limitations, and ease of placement and revision/removal.(no content)Given that the revision rate of any custom facial implant is in the 40% range, the concept of \"easy in, easy out and easy back in\" has great clinical merit.(no content)According to one surgeon's perspective, a more rigid material like Medpor may give better results in the jaw, whereas in the midface it probably doesn't matter as much.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"34c11edb-a554-4f03-806c-f21fd047f8d2","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:29:49.599Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"PEEK vs silicone vs Medpor facial implants comparison 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01VRbbNFWcci1M2K549o7AFZ","content":[{"title":"Balancing beauty and science: a review of facial implant materials in craniofacial surgery - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10847330/"},{"title":"Silicone Vs PEEK Implants - What Mogs And Why? | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/silicone-vs-peek-implants-what-mogs-and-why.105451/"},{"title":"Frontiers | Balancing beauty and science: a review of facial implant materials in craniofacial surgery","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/surgery/articles/10.3389/fsurg.2024.1348140/full"},{"title":"Finding the Best Facial Implant for You: PEEK, Custom Jaw, Medpor, and More | Newport Beach Plastic Surgery | Jonathan Zelken, MD | Facelift | Jonathan Zelken, MD","url":"https://www.zelkenmd.com/post/finding-the-best-facial-implant-for-you-peek-custom-jaw-medpor-and-more"},{"title":"Facial Implants: Controversies and Criticism.

However, patients should expect to budget around $7,000 to $11,000 for eyelid surgery, encompassing surgeon's fees, facility costs, anesthesia, tests, and follow-up care.\n\nSpecific procedure costs vary:\n- In San Francisco, upper blepharoplasty costs around $3,000, and a lower blepharoplasty costs around $4,000.\n- A lower blepharoplasty surgery will cost from $7,000 to $9,500. An upper blepharoplasty surgery will cost $4,000 to $6,000, and a surgery to address both upper and lower eyelids will cost from $9,000 to $11,000.\n\n**Factors affecting cost:**\n- Where the procedure is performed can vary by facility. For example, a hospital or surgical center may tack on extra fees.\n- Newly board-certified plastic surgeons may not charge as much as surgeons with extensive experience.\n- The anesthesia used during your procedure matters—most doctors perform upper eyelid surgeries using local anesthesia with oral sedation. General anesthesia, if needed, will cost more.\n\n### Insurance Coverage\n\nMost health insurance does not cover cosmetic surgery or its complications. When eyelid surgery is performed to eliminate the redundant skin covering the eyelashes, it may be covered by insurance.(no content)Insurance carriers will only cover the cost of upper eyelid surgery if the patient has an obstruction of their visual field. This must be documented during an examination with formal visual field testing and photographs.\n\n### Recovery\n\nMost people return to normal activities after seven to 10 days following blepharoplasty. By two weeks after eyelid surgery, the majority of the bruising and swelling will resolve.(no content)After blepharoplasty, you will be moved to a recovery room until you are ready to go home. It's normal to have some temporary side effects like blurred vision, watering eyes, light sensitivity, double vision, puffy eyelids, swelling or bruising, and pain and discomfort.(no content)Recovery from blepharoplasty is usually not very painful. Patients may experience mild discomfort, swelling, or bruising in the days following the procedure. These symptoms are temporary and manageable with prescribed medications and proper care.\n\n### Complications and Risks\n\nOpting for a lower-cost surgeon with limited experience in eyelid surgery can lead to unsatisfactory results, functional issues, or complications that require revision surgery. Revision blepharoplasty is significantly more complex and expensive than a primary surgery due to the need for scar tissue correction and delicate reconstruction of the eyelid structure.(no content)Their in-depth understanding of eyelid function, tear production, and eye health makes them uniquely qualified to perform blepharoplasty with both aesthetic and functional precision. Their expertise helps reduce complications, such as dry eyes or eyelid malposition, which can occur when the procedure is performed by a less specialized surgeon.\n\n### Longevity of Results\n\nBlepharoplasty results are long-lasting, with many patients enjoying the benefits for 10 to 15 years or more. Factors such as aging, lifestyle, and genetics can influence how long the results remain noticeable.(no content)The results of blepharoplasty (eyelid surgery) are generally long lasting.

But I dislike how he has almost no online presence...\"(no content)Pagnoni charges a bit more (27k-30k euros) for bimax and \"is very skilled with implants... can design them himself and can also work with Liam (giant implants). Also does rhino.\"(no content)For jaw surgery and implants or implants alone, Pagnoni is recommended.\n\n### Dr. Alfaro\nAlfaro \"has by far the most number of published good results.\" However, there are criticisms: \"Alfaro does tons of CCW rotation.

But I dislike how he has almost no online presence...\"(no content)Pagnoni charges a bit more (27k-30k euros) for bimax and \"is very skilled with implants... can design them himself and can also work with Liam (giant implants). Also does rhino.\"(no content)For jaw surgery and implants or implants alone, Pagnoni is recommended.\n\n### Dr. Alfaro\nAlfaro \"has by far the most number of published good results.\" However, there are criticisms: \"Alfaro does tons of CCW rotation.

Eppley, MD, DMD is a double-board-certified plastic surgeon specializing in cosmetic procedures for the face, breast and body, with patients in 67 countries around the globe. He is considered the world's foremost authority in the creation of custom implants for the face and body.(no content)His practice is located at 12188-A North Meridian St. Suite 310, Carmel, IN 46032.\n\n### Cost Information\n\nThe total cost of a custom jawline implant, including all costs for fabrication and surgical placement, is in the range of $12,000 to $13,000. Note: This pricing information is from an older blog post (2013), so current costs may differ.\n\nOne patient inquiry mentioned that a custom chin implant could be up to $9,000 and cheek implants around $15,000, for a potential total of $24,000 when combined.(no content)Dr. Eppley notes that custom facial implants are not significantly more expensive than preformed off-the-shelf implants. While the material cost of the custom implant is higher, they can be surgically placed in half the operative time, so the extra cost to design and fabricate a custom jawline implant is partially offset by the savings of a quicker operation.\n\n### Patient Reviews\n\nOne RealSelf reviewer stated: \"Dr Eppley is a very skilled and meticulous plastic surgeon. He has passion for his craft.\"(no content)The same patient noted they \"decided that I would rather pay more and get a custom implant, then settle for one off the shelf and risk not being happy with the result\" and that \"custom implants are the only route to go when for redesigning/enhancing your face. Custom implants are made to fit your bone structure and will allow you to get the exact results you want.\"(no content)Another patient testimonial stated: \"Everything is going well and I am ecstatic at the results. For the first time, I actually have a jawline. It's amazing how much of a difference a few millimeters in the right place can make.\"\n\n### Procedure Details\n\nA custom jawline implant is fabricated from a patient's 3D CT scan, from which a completely customized implant is made from one jaw angle to the other.(no content)For custom facial implants, the implant designing is done from a 3D CT scan which can be obtained locally and sent to Dr. Eppley - patients do NOT have to travel to his office for the scan. The scan is then used to design the implants online, with patient input during the design process.\n\n**Note:** I couldn't find specific 2024 reviews or updated 2024 pricing in the search results.

Hyaluronic acid fillers typically last 6–12 months, meaning most people require touch-up treatments 1–2 times a year to maintain results. Over five years, this could total $2,500–$10,000 or more.\n\n## Longevity\n\nStandard hyaluronic acid fillers typically last 6-9 months, while premium formulations can extend to 12 months or longer. Thicker gel formulations generally provide longer-lasting results than thinner ones.(no content)Filler longevity varies with the individual: The same product that lasts 12 months in one face can persist for five years in another.\n\nFactors affecting longevity include:\n- Metabolism plays a huge role in how long fillers last. If you have a fast metabolism, work out intensively, or are very active, your body may break down the filler more quickly. The constant movement of your lips also contributes to faster breakdown compared to other facial areas.\n- Smoking accelerates filler breakdown, sometimes reducing longevity by 30-50%. Sun exposure without protection degrades the filler over time.\n\n## Potential Complications\n\nLip fillers are generally safe, but there are some potential side effects and risks to be aware of. Side effects are typically mild and temporary. The most common side effects of lip fillers are swelling, bruising and tenderness at the injection sites. Adverse effects happen in less than 1% of lip filler procedures.(no content)Reviewers who say their results were \"Not Worth It\" typically complained of complications and side effects like asymmetries, lumps, bruising at injection sites, and migration.(no content)Vascular occlusion is a rare but serious complication that occurs when filler is accidentally injected into a blood vessel, leading to blockage. This can cause tissue damage and, in severe cases, necrosis (tissue death) or blindness if the area around the eyes is affected. Immediate medical treatment is required to address this issue.(no content)Unlike lip-filling materials from the past, hyaluronic acid fillers are temporary and can be dissolved with an injection of the enzyme hyaluronidase if there's a complication or you simply don't love your lip enhancement result.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"86e4af11-3482-4457-9cd5-fbd3b7fb5abe","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:31:34.581Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"lip filler cost longevity complications 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_011T1pFusWXXD9bR12YxEKtu","content":[{"title":"How Much Do Lip Fillers Cost Now? | RealSelf","url":"https://www.realself.com/nonsurgical/lip-filler/cost"},{"title":"Lip Filler Cost 2025: 10 Powerful Facts & Best Prices","url":"https://athenaplasticsurgery.com/lip-filler-cost/"},{"title":"How Much Are Lip Injections and How Long Do They Last?","url":"https://drtrenkle.com/how-much-are-lip-injections-and-how-long-do-they-last/"},{"title":"How Much Do Lip Fillers Cost?

Their unique design allows Dr. Eppley to place them easily through smaller, discreet oral and facial incisions.\n- This is often referred to as the 'high cheekbone look' but anatomically is a more complete coverage of the zygomatic bone that follows its more horizontal course.\n- Uses primarily **silicone** for custom implants\n\n**Dr. Michael Yaremchuk (Boston, MA)**\n- Dr. Yaremchuk has innovated the use of custom facial implants for both aesthetic and reconstructive indications. Precise measurements obtained from CT scans allow creation of virtual and physical models that allow Dr. Yaremchuk to design implants unique for the patient.\n- Dr. Yaremchuk is currently a Clinical Professor of Surgery, Part Time, at the Harvard Medical School, and Chief of Craniofacial Surgery at the Massachusetts General Hospital. He is known as an innovator and teacher who uses state-of-the-art techniques.\n\n### Cost Estimates\n\n**Standard Cheek Implants:**\n- The national average cost for a cheek implant procedure with both malar and submalar implants in the United States is $8,795, but it can vary between $6,960 and $15,872 depending on factors such as location, other procedures that might be involved or post-surgery care.\n- The average cost of cheek implants (malar augmentation) is $3,876, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. This average cost is only part of the total price – it does not include anesthesia, operating room facilities or other related expenses.\n\n**Custom Implants (Dr. Eppley's pricing):**\n- The total cost of such an implant, all costs including fabrication and surgical placement, is in the range of $12,000 to $13,000 for a custom jawline implant\n- The cost of this custom facial implant process is $3,500 to $7,500 depending upon how many implants are needed. Surgical placement costs are in addition to the implant fabrication process.\n\n### PEEK Implant Material\n\nPEEK (Polyether Ether Ketone) is a high-performance, biocompatible polymer that has gained popularity for custom facial implants. Custom PEEK implants are designed using advanced 3D imaging, allowing for a precise fit that complements your natural bone structure.(no content)A systematic review identified 32 articles detailing the use of PEEK Patient-Specific Implants (PSIs) in 194 patients for both reconstructive and aesthetic purposes. Complications, including infections and implant failures, were reported in 18% of cases, suggesting the need for improved implant materials.(no content)PEEK is the main material used for the production of the implants and have a long clinical history of more than 20 years of use.(no content)PEEK implants are a biocompatible resin that is made to measure for each patient based on the patient's scanner, and the volume we want to increase. Therefore, they are the most precise and anatomical option that we can offer you today.\n\n### Important Notes\n- Specific pricing for custom PEEK cheekbone implants was not found in the search results\n- Those looking for an individualized result can have their implants custom-made. Not surprisingly, this option is the most expensive.\n- Custom implants typically cost significantly more than standard off-the-shelf implants due to the 3D imaging, design, and fabrication process\n- For accurate pricing, direct consultation with surgeons like Dr. Eppley or Dr. Yaremchuk is recommended\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"89361c47-42ed-467d-a1c4-374536e4022c","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:31:54.277Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"zygoma cheekbone implant custom PEEK Eppley Yaremchuk cost 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01MbuXd1YUatAbqTiwH6fTk8","content":[{"title":"Custom Midface Implants - Cheek Implants | Eppley Custom Facial Implants","url":"https://www.eppleycustomfacialimplants.com/midface-implants/"},{"title":"Custom Facial Implants | Eppley Custom Facial Implants","url":"https://www.eppleycustomfacialimplants.com/"},{"title":"Cheek Reshaping - Cheek Contouring Specialists","url":"https://www.eppleyplasticsurgery.com/cheek/"},{"title":"Total Face Implants | Eppley Custom Facial Implants","url":"https://www.eppleycustomfacialimplants.com/total-face-implants/"},{"title":"Cosmetic Facial Implants - Custom Implants & Sculpting","url":"https://www.eppleyplasticsurgery.com/cosmetic-facial-implants/"},{"title":"Custom Infraorbital-Malar Implants - Plastic Surgeon | Dr. Barry L.
