   315→    'Lower Third': 'Facial thirds assess the vertical height of facial thirds relative to total facial height, favoring a balanced proportion with a slightly taller Lower Third in males.',
   316→    'Middle Third': 'The middle third spans from the brow line to the base of the nose. A balanced middle third contributes to overall facial harmony.',
   317→    'Upper Third': 'The upper third spans from the hairline to the brow line. Its proportion affects forehead prominence and hairline positioning.',
   318→    'Lateral Canthal Tilt': 'Canthal tilt measures the angle of the eye from inner to outer corner. A positive tilt (outer corner higher) is generally considered more attractive and youthful.',
   319→    'Gonial Angle': 'The gonial angle measures the angle at the jaw corner. A well-defined angle contributes to jaw prominence and facial structure.',
   320→    'Bigonial Width': 'Bigonial width measures the distance between the jaw angles. It contributes to the perception of jaw strength and facial width.',
   321→    'Eye Aspect Ratio': 'Eye aspect ratio compares eye height to width. Almond-shaped eyes with balanced proportions are often considered ideal.',
   322→    'Nasal Index': 'The nasal index compares nose width to height. Balanced proportions contribute to facial harmony.',
   323→    'Chin Philtrum Ratio': 'This ratio compares chin height to philtrum length. Proper balance contributes to lower face harmony.',
   324→    'Submental Cervical Angle': 'This angle measures the definition between chin and neck. A well-defined angle creates a clean jawline profile.',
   325→    'Nose Bridge Width': 'Compares nose bridge width to the overall nose width. Ideal proportions create a refined nasal appearance.',
   326→    'Eyebrow Tilt': 'Measures the angle of the eyebrows. Balanced tilt contributes to a harmonious eye region.',
   327→    'Brow Length Ratio': 'Compares eyebrow length to face width. Appropriately proportioned eyebrows create better facial framing.',
