This more defined angle is linked to perceptions of a strong, masculine jawline.\n\n### Professional vs. Layperson Perspectives\nOrthodontists and surgeons gave the highest attractiveness scores to intergonial:interzygomatic ratio of 72.53%, while the best ratio was 74.45% for the laypeople. The range of beautiful intergonial:interzygomatic ratio was 72.53% to 86.03%.

Previous analysis yielded closer ranges between men and women of 96 and 98 degrees, respectively. Further refinement used opinions of seasoned rhinoplasty surgeons from the Rhinoplasty Society.\n\n### Cross-Cultural Findings\nThe perception of an ideal nose is influenced by a variety of factors, with demographic characteristics playing a significant role.

An arbitrary range of 90 to 115 degrees for the nasolabial angle is usually stated in the literature.\n\n### Rhinoplasty Outcomes\nIn an Indian population study, significant improvements were observed in the nasolabial angle from 92.9 ± 16.4 to 101.6 ± 10.4 immediately post-op and 110.3 ± 9.8 at 6-months follow-up.\n\n### Psychological Considerations\nNasolabial angle, nasofacial angle, alar width, and intercanthal distance were not different between rhinoplasty candidates and controls. Four major aesthetic nasal proportions were statistically similar in both groups. Surprisingly, the patients having rhinoplasty showed a mean width-to-length ratio closer to aesthetic ideal, suggesting that applying for rhinoplasty may have strong psychological reasons (e.g., body dysmorphic symptoms) compared with realistic aesthetic appraisals.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e4297573-5d3b-4a82-a2ee-3c0cd50ef361","timestamp":"2025-12-26T22:47:45.863Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"nasolabial angle nose attractiveness rhinoplasty ideal study pubmed","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01L3efnz4KrUerpzVGSeA8W8","content":[{"title":"The ideal nasolabial angle in rhinoplasty: a preference analysis of the general population - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25068320/"},{"title":"Preferred Nasolabial Angle in Rhinoplasty: A Cross-Sectional Analysis - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37738132/"},{"title":"Defining the ideal nasolabial angle - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22090249/"},{"title":"Redefining the ideal nasolabial angle: Part 2.

The study concluded that medial canthal tilt appears to be a powerful cue used in judging human female facial attractiveness.(no content)The study was designed to identify medial canthal tilt as an important cue in evaluating human female facial attractiveness. Researchers used SuperLab Pro software and had judges make forced choices between unmodified faces and faces with digitally accentuated medial canthal tilt using Adobe Photoshop.(no content)The power of canthal tilt as an attractiveness cue may be due to its relation to the neotenic and sexually dimorphic cue of palpebral fissure inclination.\n\n### Definitions and Classifications\n\nThe canthal tilt is the angle of the lateral canthus (outside corner of eye) in relation to the medial canthus (inside corner of eye). A positive canthal tilt means the lateral canthus is higher on the face in relation to the medial canthus. In contrast, a negative canthal tilt means the lateral canthus is lower on the face than the medial canthus.(no content)According to a study by Codner et al. (2008), canthal tilt was considered positive when the lateral canthus is above the medial canthus, neutral when they are at the same level, and negative when the lateral canthus is lower.\n\n### Sexual Dimorphism\n\nCanthal tilt is mildly sexually dimorphic, with women being more likely to have upward slanting eyes than men, at least among Caucasians.(no content)This phenomenon is explained by the fact that a steeper palpebral fissure inclination is a neonatal and sexually dimorphic feature.\n\n### Ethnic Variations\n\nAccording to Rhee et al., an attractive Korean face has a canthal tilt of 8.87°, which falls into the class II category (more than 5°).(no content)A positive canthal tilt is more common among East Asians, however female East Asian faces judged to be particularly attractive have a less pronounced positive canthal tilt than what is typical for those populations.\n\n### Male Attractiveness\n\nResearch by Penčić et al. (2019) highlighted that in males, an ideal canthal tilt is neutral or slightly positive, as it enhances perceptions of youthfulness and facial balance. Conversely, a negative canthal tilt is often linked with signs of aging and less favorable aesthetic outcomes.\n\n### Association with Youth\n\nAs we age, the tissues around the eyes tend to lose elasticity, and the lateral canthus can droop slightly, leading to a more neutral or even downward canthal tilt. Therefore, an upward tilt can be subconsciously associated with youth and vitality.\n\nThe key PubMed reference is: **Bashour, M., & Geist, C.

Key findings include:\n\nA total of 23 RCTs with 1474 participants were analyzed. In a meta-analysis of all 23 RCTs, collagen supplements significantly improved skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkles.(no content)However, in the sensitivity analysis, excluding outlier studies showing an extreme beneficial effect, collagen supplements showed no significant improvement of wrinkles and a decreased effect for hydration and elasticity.(no content)In the subgroup meta-analysis by funding source, studies not receiving funding from pharmaceutical companies revealed no effect of collagen supplements for improving skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkles, while those receiving funding from pharmaceutical companies did show significant effects.

Key findings include:\n\nA total of 23 RCTs with 1474 participants were analyzed. In a meta-analysis of all 23 RCTs, collagen supplements significantly improved skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkles.(no content)However, in the sensitivity analysis, excluding outlier studies showing an extreme beneficial effect, collagen supplements showed no significant improvement of wrinkles and a decreased effect for hydration and elasticity.(no content)In the subgroup meta-analysis by funding source, studies not receiving funding from pharmaceutical companies revealed no effect of collagen supplements for improving skin hydration, elasticity, and wrinkles, while those receiving funding from pharmaceutical companies did show significant effects. Similarly, high-quality studies revealed no significant effect in all categories, while low-quality studies revealed a significant improvement in elasticity.\n\n### Study Limitations\n\nThe interventions used in the included studies exhibited some heterogeneity, primarily because of the distinct measurement units and composition of the supplementation.

Among others, sexual dimorphism (i.e., masculinity for male faces/femininity for female faces) is an influential factor of perceived attractiveness.(no content)Several facial morphologies and skin properties have been identified as critical cues to attractiveness, including averageness, symmetry, and skin colour.\n\n### Femininity in Female Faces\nMale faces with more masculine traits and female faces with more feminine traits are perceived as more attractive. In particular, the preference for femininity in female faces is widespread across cultures and ages.(no content)In all samples, women's perceived femininity was positively related to their perceived attractiveness. Women found perceived masculinity in men attractive only in Czechia and Colombia, two distant populations. The association between perceived sexual dimorphism and attractiveness is thus potentially universal only for women.\n\n### Masculinity in Male Faces - Mixed Results\nThe preference for masculinity in male faces varies more; some studies demonstrated a masculinity preference while some other studies showed a femininity preference, or no obvious relationship.(no content)Masculinity in male faces can be associated with negative personality traits and behaviours; male-looking facial features are generally less preferred because these features conceive emotionally negative male personalities such as aggressiveness or dominance. Likewise, highly masculine faces are perceived as less emotionally warm and less cooperative than more feminine faces.\n\n### Cross-Cultural Variation\nHuman populations vary substantially and unexpectedly in both the magnitude and direction of facial sexually dimorphic traits. In particular, European and South American populations display larger levels of facial sexual dimorphism than African populations.(no content)There were no significant preferences among the Aka, Shuar, or Tchimba populations. Randomization tests revealed an average male preference for feminized female faces among the Canadian, Fijian, Hangzhouvian, Kadazan, Shanghainese, Cree, and UK populations.\n\n### Evolutionary Perspectives\nA large literature proposes that preferences for exaggerated sex typicality in human faces (masculinity/femininity) reflect a long evolutionary history of sexual and social selection. These data challenge the hypothesis that facial dimorphism was an important ancestral signal of heritable mate value.(no content)Such a trade-off between preference for a good gene and a good dad makes male facial attractiveness judgments more complicated.\n\n### Recent Multi-Population Studies\nResearchers investigated preferences in both sexes for three structural components of facial beauty: symmetry, sexual dimorphism, and distinctiveness. Based on a large sample of faces (n = 1550) from 10 populations across the world (Brazil, Cameroon, Czechia, Colombia, India, Namibia, Romania, Turkey, UK, and Vietnam), distinctiveness negatively affects the perception of attractiveness in both sexes.(no content)In humans, the femininity of women's faces is considered attractive to men, but preferences for masculinity in men's faces vary across studies.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"da89dfdf-85ae-4fc1-a9a5-b749925b1187","timestamp":"2025-12-26T22:47:51.136Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"sexual dimorphism facial features masculinity femininity attractiveness study","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0149PBwjxtHe9pVFbTwjUQJ5","content":[{"title":"A new data-driven mathematical model dissociates attractiveness from sexual dimorphism of human faces | Scientific Reports","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73472-8"},{"title":"How and why patterns of sexual dimorphism in human faces vary across the world | Scientific Reports","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-85402-3"},{"title":"Distinctiveness and femininity, rather than symmetry and masculinity, affect facial attractiveness across the world - ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1090513823000879"},{"title":"How and why patterns of sexual dimorphism in human faces vary across the world - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7966798/"},{"title":"Human preferences for sexually dimorphic faces may be evolutionarily novel | PNAS","url":"https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1409643111"},{"title":"Human preferences for sexually dimorphic faces may be evolutionarily novel - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4210032/"},{"title":"A new data-driven mathematical model dissociates attractiveness from sexual dimorphism of human faces - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC7538911/"},{"title":"Facial attractiveness and preference of sexual dimorphism: A comparison across five populations - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10427909/"},{"title":"Influence of sexual dimorphism on the attractiveness evaluation of one’s own face - ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698920300158"},{"title":"Facial attractiveness and preference of sexual dimorphism: A comparison across five populations | Evolutionary Human Sciences | Cambridge Core","url":"https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/evolutionary-human-sciences/article/facial-attractiveness-and-preference-of-sexual-dimorphism-a-comparison-across-five-populations/855665E31FE47492B4F5356B5F34FE7F"}]},"Here are the search results on sexual dimorphism, facial features, and attractiveness:\n\n## Key Research Findings\n\n### General Overview\nHuman facial attractiveness is evaluated by using multiple cues.

Horizontal (into thirds) and vertical (into fifths) anatomical proportions can provide a valuable framework for cosmetic interventions.\"(no content)Leonardo da Vinci described dividing the face into equal thirds in his writings on human anatomy.(no content)Canon 2, the rule that states that the face can be divided into equal thirds with the nose occupying the middle third, varied between ethnic groups (P = 0.033) and from the ideal value. On average, all male faces had a larger upper face compared with the midface.\n\n### Validity of Neoclassical Canons\n\nNeoclassical canons were invalidated due to the differences in transcultural facial structures such as Chinese, Arabian, Turkish, Croatian, Korean-American, and Greek. However, neoclassical canons were more valid in whites than in Asians.(no content)Although individuals may be esthetically pleasing, they do not exhibit equal facial thirds or conform to orbital or orbito-nasal canons. The three neoclassical canons studied could not be validated in young adults originating from the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n### Midface and Attractiveness\n\nA significantly positive association was observed between the middle facial height and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) scores in the male models (p < 0.05).(no content)The neoclassical canon assumptions hold that ideal horizontal third proportions are in perfect 1:1:1 ratios. However, work by Farkas demonstrated normal proportions for males and females differ from the canon and each other, with male proportions being 31.0%, 30.5%, and 38.5%, and female proportions being 29.5%, 32.4%, and 38.2% for the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the face, respectively.(no content)Only 1% of the study population had equal facial thirds, the midface was the shortest of the facial thirds and the male gender generally had larger mean values of the facial dimensions than the female gender.\n\n### Golden Ratio Findings\n\nThe results showed that the facial golden ratio was not valid in modern beautiful women.(no content)More than half of the measurements (42/77) in females and thirty-two measurements in males were found to be significantly different from the ideal target value (p < 0.05) upon the comparison of the attractive faces with golden ratio, neoclassical canons, 'ideal' ratios and 'ideal' angles.\n\n### Attractive Facial Characteristics\n\nAn attractive female face can be interpreted as having a shorter and broader nose, broader inter-endocanthus and inter-exocanthus width, shorter lower facial third, thicker vermillion of both upper and lower lips, shorter upper lip, flatter labio-mental fold and retrusive mandible comparing to the recommended ideal faces.(no content)Studies showed significant difference between anonymous and attractive females.

Horizontal (into thirds) and vertical (into fifths) anatomical proportions can provide a valuable framework for cosmetic interventions.\"(no content)Leonardo da Vinci described dividing the face into equal thirds in his writings on human anatomy.(no content)Canon 2, the rule that states that the face can be divided into equal thirds with the nose occupying the middle third, varied between ethnic groups (P = 0.033) and from the ideal value. On average, all male faces had a larger upper face compared with the midface.\n\n### Validity of Neoclassical Canons\n\nNeoclassical canons were invalidated due to the differences in transcultural facial structures such as Chinese, Arabian, Turkish, Croatian, Korean-American, and Greek. However, neoclassical canons were more valid in whites than in Asians.(no content)Although individuals may be esthetically pleasing, they do not exhibit equal facial thirds or conform to orbital or orbito-nasal canons. The three neoclassical canons studied could not be validated in young adults originating from the Arabian Peninsula.\n\n### Midface and Attractiveness\n\nA significantly positive association was observed between the middle facial height and VAS (Visual Analogue Scale) scores in the male models (p < 0.05).(no content)The neoclassical canon assumptions hold that ideal horizontal third proportions are in perfect 1:1:1 ratios. However, work by Farkas demonstrated normal proportions for males and females differ from the canon and each other, with male proportions being 31.0%, 30.5%, and 38.5%, and female proportions being 29.5%, 32.4%, and 38.2% for the upper, middle, and lower thirds of the face, respectively.(no content)Only 1% of the study population had equal facial thirds, the midface was the shortest of the facial thirds and the male gender generally had larger mean values of the facial dimensions than the female gender.\n\n### Golden Ratio Findings\n\nThe results showed that the facial golden ratio was not valid in modern beautiful women.(no content)More than half of the measurements (42/77) in females and thirty-two measurements in males were found to be significantly different from the ideal target value (p < 0.05) upon the comparison of the attractive faces with golden ratio, neoclassical canons, 'ideal' ratios and 'ideal' angles.\n\n### Attractive Facial Characteristics\n\nAn attractive female face can be interpreted as having a shorter and broader nose, broader inter-endocanthus and inter-exocanthus width, shorter lower facial third, thicker vermillion of both upper and lower lips, shorter upper lip, flatter labio-mental fold and retrusive mandible comparing to the recommended ideal faces.(no content)Studies showed significant difference between anonymous and attractive females. Attractive females showed smaller face in general and uniformity of the facial thirds and fifths, and most of the facial parameters meet the criteria of the ideal proportions."],"durationSeconds":30.835679042000322}}

Multiple factors are linked to vitamin D status, such as Fitzpatrick skin type, sex, body mass index, physical activity, alcohol intake, and vitamin D receptor polymorphisms.\n   - Maintaining a vitamin D serum concentration within normal levels is warranted in atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, vitiligo, polymorphous light eruption, and mycosis fungoides.\n\n2. **\"Vitamin D and the Skin: A Review for Dermatologists\"** (2019)\n   - In recent years, the growing interest in the role played by vitamin D in skin disease has given rise to many studies. Of particular interest are the latest discoveries about the role of vitamin D in skin diseases such as lupus erythematosus, ichthyosis, atopic dermatitis, hidradenitis suppurativa, acne, alopecia areata, androgenetic alopecia, melanoma, and nonmelanoma skin cancer.\n\n### Clinical Trials\n\n3. **Psoriasis Clinical Trial** (JAMA Dermatology, 2023)\n   - The trial was conducted at the University Hospital of North Norway. Adults with active plaque psoriasis and 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels of less than 24 ng/mL were included. The intervention was vitamin D (cholecalciferol, 100,000 IU loading dose, followed by 20,000 IU/week) or placebo for 4 months.\n   - The results showed that vitamin D supplementation did not affect psoriasis severity. Low baseline severity scores may explain the lack of measurable effect.\n\n4. **Atopic Dermatitis Clinical Trial**\n   - Sixty AD patients were included in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial study. They were randomly divided into two groups and treated for 60 days: group vitamin D (n=30), and placebo group (n=30). Group D received 1600 IU cholecalciferol (vitamin D).\n   - According to SCORAD and TIS value index, the vitamin D group showed significant improvement in patients with mild, moderate and severe AD (P<0.05).\n\n5. **Severe Atopic Dermatitis Trial** (2020)\n   - Vitamin D supplementation with standard treatment yielded positive clinical outcomes in mild and moderate atopic dermatitis; however, the potential benefit of vitamin D in severe cases remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate the impact of vitamin D supplementation on response to standard treatment in pediatrics with severe atopic dermatitis.\n\n6. **Melanoma Clinical Trial (ViDMe Trial)** (2024)\n   - Cutaneous melanoma is the most lethal form of skin cancer. Previous studies have shown that low vitamin D levels at the time of diagnosis are associated with thicker tumours and worse outcome. This study examined whether monthly high-dose vitamin D supplementation after diagnosis could improve outcomes.\n   - The clinical trial included 436 patients with CM who were randomly allocated into two groups - 218 patients received placebo and 218 received monthly oral vitamin D.\n\n### Topical Vitamin D\n\n7. **\"Off-label uses of topical vitamin D in dermatology: a systematic review\"**\n   - A total of 165 articles met the inclusion criteria. A moderate to strong recommendation was given for the use of topical vitamin D in combination with corticosteroids and phototherapy in vitiligo and as monotherapy for various ichthyoses, morphea, pityriasis alba, prurigo nodularis, and polymorphous light eruption.\n\n### Vitamin D Synthesis in Skin\n\n8. **\"Vitamin D and the skin\"**\n   - Vitamin D is a fat-soluble nutrient that humans obtain through the diet and by synthesis in the skin upon exposure to ultraviolet B. Vitamin D is then converted by the liver to 25-hydroxyvitamin D, its major circulating form. Under the influence of parathyroid hormone, the kidney then converts 25-hydroxyvitamin D to 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D, the biologically active, hormonal form.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ec50fdd4-ff5f-42d6-b7f7-9d317c2849c7","timestamp":"2025-12-26T22:48:35.547Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"vitamin D skin health dermatology study clinical trial pubmed","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_014c5xbMmBoSCK5hUaaSVbHt","content":[{"title":"Vitamin D and the Skin: An Update for Dermatologists - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28994020/"},{"title":"Vitamin D and the Skin: A Review for Dermatologists - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30857638/"},{"title":"Effect of Vitamin D Supplementation on Psoriasis Severity in Patients With Lower-Range Serum 25-Hydroxyvitamin D Levels: A Randomized Clinical Trial - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36988936/"},{"title":"Vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of atopic dermatitis: a clinical trial study - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22395583/"},{"title":"High-dose vitamin D supplementation does not improve outcome in a cutaneous melanoma population: results of a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study (ViDMe trial) - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38913652/"},{"title":"The impact of vitamin D supplementation as an adjuvant therapy on clinical outcomes in patients with severe atopic dermatitis: A randomized controlled trial - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33145984/"},{"title":"Off-label uses of topical vitamin D in dermatology: a systematic review - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24636434/"},{"title":"Vitamin D and the skin - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21034990/"},{"title":"Sunscreens block cutaneous vitamin D production with only a minimal effect on circulating 25-hydroxyvitamin D - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28718005/"},{"title":"Vitamin D Supplementation in the Treatment of Atopic Dermatitis: A Clinical Trial Study: Scientific, Peer-Reviewed Dermatology Article Indexed with MEDLINE/PubMed","url":"http://jddonline.com/articles/dermatology/S1545961612P0327X/1"}]},"Here are the results from my search for vitamin D and skin health dermatology studies on PubMed:\n\n## Key Studies and Reviews Found:\n\n### Reviews on Vitamin D and Skin\n\n1. **\"Vitamin D and the Skin: An Update for Dermatologists\"** (2018)\n   - Vitamin D plays a key role in skeletal and cardiovascular disorders, cancers, central nervous system diseases, reproductive diseases, infections, and autoimmune and dermatological disorders.\n   - The two main sources of vitamin D are sun exposure and oral intake, including vitamin D supplementation and dietary intake.

Participants made paired comparisons of attractiveness between faces with identical facial features but different eye–mouth distances and different interocular distances.

The study acknowledges differences in the perception of beauty among races but notes that wide-set eyes are universally considered more attractive within each racial context.\n\n### Additional Findings\nAccording to the study by Sforza et al. (2015), attractive young women and men had longer eye fissure lengths on both sides compared to individuals with average attractiveness. This increased length, along with a larger external orbital surface area, may create a more aesthetically pleasing and youthful appearance.(no content)It is considered aesthetically pleasing if the distance between the eyes is roughly equal or similar to the width of one eye.

One of the most recognizable features of the midface is the contour and prominence of the superior-lateral part of the cheek, termed the malar eminence or 'cheekbone', formed by the underlying zygomatic bone.(no content)The zygoma's size and shape can significantly affect the overall contours of the face, contributing to the perception of beauty and attractiveness. The zygoma significantly influences the aesthetic appearance of the cheek.\n\n### Scientific Studies on Attractiveness\n\nA large conjoint analysis study (N=922) published in Frontiers in Psychology found interesting results about cheekbone prominence relative to other facial features:\n\nThis study used a conjoint face ranking task to predict the relative contribution of five sexually dimorphic facial shape features (jawbone and cheekbone prominence, eyebrow thickness, eye size, face length) to participants' perceptions of facial attractiveness and sex-typicality. For overall partner attractiveness, eyebrow thickness and jawbone prominence were relatively more salient than cheekbone prominence and eye size.(no content)Previous research has identified several prominent shape cues that contribute to perceptions of sexual dimorphism: eyebrow prominence, cheekbone prominence, eye size, facial height, and jawbone prominence. Among these features, cheekbone prominence and eye size were reliably larger in women (i.e., are positively related to a feminine face shape).\n\n### Cultural and Gender Considerations\n\nIn White European individuals, a distinct malar prominence is often considered a sign of beauty and youth. However, the 'perfect' shape of a malar prominence has never been determined.\n\nA recent 3D model study found that the mean zygoma score was 4.87 out of 10 when assessors rated the importance of the malar region in facial beauty. However, no significant influence of zygoma score on the evaluation of 3D models was found (P = 0.343).\n\n### Links to Attractiveness Research\n\nStudies suggest that individuals with prominent cheekbones are considered more attractive (Tanner, 1978, Keating et al., 1981, Scheib et al., 1999).(no content)The prominence of this area influences the O-G curve and is a major determinant for facial attractiveness.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe research suggests that while cheekbone prominence is associated with facial attractiveness, its relative importance may be less than other features like jawbone prominence and eyebrow thickness. Additionally, preferences appear to be gender-specific, with cheekbone prominence being more associated with feminine facial shapes.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b3cd52ff-782b-4910-8220-d9ef922c03d9","timestamp":"2025-12-26T22:49:48.305Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"cheekbone prominence zygoma facial attractiveness study","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Ge1iK1MyG6TdpW15xmMUnr","content":[{"title":"Cosmetic Surgery A Three-Dimensional Model Study on Beauty Standards for Cheekbones in Both Sexes","url":"https://www.gavinpublishers.com/article/view/cosmetic-surgery-a-three-dimensional-model-study-on-beauty-standards-for-cheekbones-in-both-sexes"},{"title":"The Role of Zygoma in Facial Structure","url":"https://www.numberanalytics.com/blog/zygoma-role-facial-structure"},{"title":"Frontiers | The Relative Contribution of Jawbone and Cheekbone Prominence, Eyebrow Thickness, Eye Size, and Face Length to Evaluations of Facial Masculinity and Attractiveness: A Conjoint Data-Driven Approach","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2018.02428/full"},{"title":"The Relative Contribution of Jawbone and Cheekbone Prominence, Eyebrow Thickness, Eye Size, and Face Length to Evaluations of Facial Masculinity and Attractiveness: A Conjoint Data-Driven Approach - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6290027/"},{"title":"Zygomatic bone - Knowledge and References | Taylor & Francis","url":"https://taylorandfrancis.com/knowledge/Medicine_and_healthcare/Anatomy/Zygomatic_bone/"},{"title":"What’s in a face?

However, the 'perfect' shape of a malar prominence has never been determined.\n\nA recent 3D model study found that the mean zygoma score was 4.87 out of 10 when assessors rated the importance of the malar region in facial beauty. However, no significant influence of zygoma score on the evaluation of 3D models was found (P = 0.343).\n\n### Links to Attractiveness Research\n\nStudies suggest that individuals with prominent cheekbones are considered more attractive (Tanner, 1978, Keating et al., 1981, Scheib et al., 1999).(no content)The prominence of this area influences the O-G curve and is a major determinant for facial attractiveness.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe research suggests that while cheekbone prominence is associated with facial attractiveness, its relative importance may be less than other features like jawbone prominence and eyebrow thickness. Additionally, preferences appear to be gender-specific, with cheekbone prominence being more associated with feminine facial shapes."],"durationSeconds":28.257468624999746}}

Over time, this exposure causes cumulative damage, leading to both aesthetic changes and structural degradation of the skin. These effects manifest as rhytids (wrinkles), dyschromia, textural changes, elastosis, volume loss, telangiectasias, and hyperkeratosis, collectively contributing to a prematurely aged appearance.\n\n## Key Mechanisms\n\nUnlike other organs, skin is in direct contact with the environment and therefore undergoes aging as a consequence of environmental damage. The primary environmental factor that causes human skin aging is UV irradiation from the sun. This sun-induced skin aging (photoaging), like chronological aging, is a cumulative process.(no content)Photoaged skin displays alterations in the cellular component and extracellular matrix with accumulation of disorganized elastin and its microfibrillar component fibrillin in the deep dermis and a severe loss of interstitial collagens. The unifying pathogenic agents for these changes are UV-generated reactive oxygen species (ROS) which deplete and damage non-enzymatic and enzymatic antioxidant defense systems of the skin.\n\n## UVA vs UVB Effects\n\nIn the UV light spectrum, UVA and UVB radiation cause the most damage in photoaging. UVB light has shorter wavelengths and is mostly absorbed by the stratum corneum, causing erythema and changes in the epidermis, whereas UVA penetrates to the deepest layer of the skin (the dermis) and interacts with DNA. As a result of UV radiation, chemical reactions in the skin produce reactive oxygen species (ROS), which cause protein denaturation, impairment of RNA and DNA synthesis, and damage to the skin structure.(no content)UVA radiation is the most prevalent component of solar UV radiation; it deeply penetrates into the skin and induces profound alterations of the dermal connective tissue. The major visible damaging effects of UVA radiation only appear after years of exposure, and UVA radiation appears to play a key role in pigmented changes occurring with age, the major sign of skin photoaging in Asians.\n\n## Variation by Skin Type\n\nThe hallmarks of photoaging vary significantly by skin phototype. Skin of color tends to exhibit dyschromia and features associated with \"intrinsic\" aging, such as volume loss, while white skin is more prone to \"extrinsic\" aging characteristics, including rhytids and elastosis.\n\n## Immune System Effects\n\nUVR treatment can trigger a cellular senescence and inflammatory state in the skin. Chronic low-grade inflammation stimulates a counteracting immunosuppression involving an expansion of immunosuppressive cells, e.g., regulatory T cells (Treg), myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), and regulatory dendritic cells (DCreg). This increased immunosuppressive activity not only suppresses the function of effector immune cells, but it also induces bystander degeneration of neighboring cells.\n\n## Treatment and Prevention\n\nPremature skin aging, or photoaging, results largely from repeated exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun and is characterized clinically by wrinkles, mottled pigmentation, rough skin, and loss of skin tone. Studies have produced significant evidence that topical tretinoin (all-trans retinoic acid), the only agent approved so far for the treatment of photoaging, also works to prevent it.(no content)Using local sunscreen agents can not only prevent sunburn, but also help prevent photocarcinogenesis and photoaging.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3c41437f-2573-4440-b701-50a092c2d5f1","timestamp":"2025-12-26T22:50:26.541Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"skin aging photoaging UV damage clinical study dermatology pubmed","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01ELJ6p9NvMK9t7n7Lmra5re","content":[{"title":"Photoaging: Current Concepts on Molecular Mechanisms, Prevention, and Treatment - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/40072791/"},{"title":"Mechanisms of photoaging and chronological skin aging - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12437452/"},{"title":"Solar UV irradiation and dermal photoaging - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11684450/"},{"title":"New insights in photoaging, UVA induced damage and skin types - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25234829/"},{"title":"Aging and photoaging - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14512918/"},{"title":"Photoaging: UV radiation-induced inflammation and immunosuppression accelerate the aging process in the skin | Inflammation Research","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00011-022-01598-8"},{"title":"Photoaging: UV radiation-induced inflammation and immunosuppression accelerate the aging process in the skin - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9307547/"},{"title":"Recent information on photoaging mechanisms and the preventive role of topical sunscreen products - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33348940/"},{"title":"Photoaging: pathogenesis, prevention, and treatment - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11535421/"},{"title":"Role of UV light in photodamage, skin aging, and skin cancer: importance of photoprotection - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19209950/"}]},"Here are the key findings from PubMed and dermatology literature on skin aging, photoaging, and UV damage:\n\n## Overview of Photoaging\n\nPhotoaging is the consequence of chronic exposure to solar irradiation, encompassing ultraviolet (UV), visible, and infrared wavelengths.

The role of vitamin C in the hydroxylation of collagen molecules is well characterized. Hydroxylation of collagen is necessary for its extracellular stability and support of the epidermis.(no content)One of the active substances used in the photoaging treatments is ascorbic acid (vitamin C). It not only stimulates collagen synthesis but also acts as a cofactor for collagen-stabilizing lysine and proline hydroxylases and inhibits metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) activity. It also provides protection from elastin damage and inhibits the cross-linking effect that is formed in wrinkles.\n\n### Laboratory Studies\n\nVitC induced a dose-dependent increase in collagen type I deposits by normal human fibroblasts (NHF) cultured in monolayer, and enhanced extracellular matrix contraction by NHF in a lattice model, in a non-cytotoxic range of concentrations. Exogenous VitC supply could thus contribute to the maintenance of optimal collagenic density in the dermis and locally strengthen the collagen network.(no content)At 100~300 μM, the compounds augmented collagen synthesis in human dermal fibroblasts by 120~144% and 125~191%, respectively.\n\n### Clinical Evidence\n\nTopically applied vitamin C is highly efficient as a rejuvenation therapy, inducing significant collagen synthesis in all age groups with minimal side effects.(no content)A significant improvement in skin elasticity was observed after a series of tests. A significant reduction in erythema was observed after both therapies. The greatest reduction was observed on the cheeks after applying vitamin C combined with microneedling. At the same time, the results showed an excellent tolerance of both treatments, which proved them to be safe and effective.(no content)Studies also included in their anti-aging study persons with sensitive skin. The use of a cosmetic with 10% vitamin C, biopeptides, and hyaluronic acid led to wrinkle shallowing.\n\n### Skin Aging Mechanisms\n\nWith aging, the amount of elastic fibers decreases whilst their fragmentation increases; collagen fibers become thinner and more distant from each other; and their arrangement is reorganized.

The role of vitamin C in the hydroxylation of collagen molecules is well characterized. Hydroxylation of collagen is necessary for its extracellular stability and support of the epidermis.(no content)One of the active substances used in the photoaging treatments is ascorbic acid (vitamin C). It not only stimulates collagen synthesis but also acts as a cofactor for collagen-stabilizing lysine and proline hydroxylases and inhibits metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) activity. It also provides protection from elastin damage and inhibits the cross-linking effect that is formed in wrinkles.\n\n### Laboratory Studies\n\nVitC induced a dose-dependent increase in collagen type I deposits by normal human fibroblasts (NHF) cultured in monolayer, and enhanced extracellular matrix contraction by NHF in a lattice model, in a non-cytotoxic range of concentrations. Exogenous VitC supply could thus contribute to the maintenance of optimal collagenic density in the dermis and locally strengthen the collagen network.(no content)At 100~300 μM, the compounds augmented collagen synthesis in human dermal fibroblasts by 120~144% and 125~191%, respectively.\n\n### Clinical Evidence\n\nTopically applied vitamin C is highly efficient as a rejuvenation therapy, inducing significant collagen synthesis in all age groups with minimal side effects.(no content)A significant improvement in skin elasticity was observed after a series of tests. A significant reduction in erythema was observed after both therapies. The greatest reduction was observed on the cheeks after applying vitamin C combined with microneedling. At the same time, the results showed an excellent tolerance of both treatments, which proved them to be safe and effective.(no content)Studies also included in their anti-aging study persons with sensitive skin. The use of a cosmetic with 10% vitamin C, biopeptides, and hyaluronic acid led to wrinkle shallowing.\n\n### Skin Aging Mechanisms\n\nWith aging, the amount of elastic fibers decreases whilst their fragmentation increases; collagen fibers become thinner and more distant from each other; and their arrangement is reorganized. Furthermore, their production by fibroblasts decreases, while, at the same time, the activity of metalloproteinases (MMPs), which break down collagen, increases.(no content)The anti-aging effect of ascorbic acid is based on both the antioxidant properties of vitamin C and its role as a cofactor in proper collagen production. Vitamin C also impairs the expression of metalloproteinases 1 and 2 after the UVA induction. The metalloproteinases are overexpressed in aging skin, leading to collagen and other parts of extracellular matrix degeneration. The impact of vitamin C on metalloproteinases is due to its antioxidant potency.\n\n### Emerging Combination Therapies\n\nExperiments showed that glycinamide was the most effective among the various amino acids and amidated amino acids in stimulating collagen production in human dermal fibroblasts. Thus, it is possible to synergistically improve collagen synthesis by combining AA analogs and amino acid analogs that act at different stages of the collagen production process. This combination therapy would be useful for skin antiaging that requires enhanced collagen production."],"durationSeconds":26.861813208999113}}
