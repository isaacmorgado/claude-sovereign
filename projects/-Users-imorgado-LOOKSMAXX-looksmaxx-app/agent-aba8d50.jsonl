In the United States, the average cost is $16,000, meaning cheekbone reduction in Thailand is about 78% less than in the U.S.(no content)Thai clinics usually include pre-op consultations, general anesthesia, the surgery itself, one or two nights of hospitalization, medications, and follow-up visits. In the U.S., the listed price often covers only the surgeon's fee, with anesthesia, facility, and aftercare billed separately.\n\n### Specific Clinic Pricing\n- B.Care Medical Center offers cheekbone reduction packages starting at 195,000 THB (approximately $5,400), covering surgery, 2 nights' deluxe accommodation with meals, pre-op checks, medications, and post-op care.\n- Some surgeons offer cheekbone reduction for around $3,000, typically covering surgery, anesthesia, recovery rooms, consultations, nursing care, medications, and one follow-up.\n\n### Procedure Details\nPatients with excessively prominent front cheekbones, broad cheekbones, and disproportionate or unbalanced facial structures benefit the most from cheekbone reduction. The surgery can remove or correct bone protrusions, making the facial line look sleeker, slimmer, softer, and much more attractive.(no content)The technique involves an L-shaped osteotomy or two-site osteotomy and rotation method with two incision scars - one intra-oral for the zygomatic body, and another in front of the ear behind the sideburn for the zygomatic arch. The cheekbone is rotated inwardly and fixed by a mini-titanium plate and screws.\n\n### Recovery\nPlan to stay near Bangkok for 7-10 days to accommodate your surgery and follow-up appointments.\n\n### Notable Hospitals\n- **Kamol Hospital** (Bangkok) - Specializes in facial contouring procedures\n- **Wansiri Hospital** - A private medical center in Bangkok specializing in surgery and plastic surgery\n- **Yanhee International Hospital** - A prominent medical center in Thailand specializing in cosmetic and plastic surgery with ISO certification (since 2000), Thai Hospital Accreditation (HA), and internationally recognized JCI accreditation.\n\nNote: For cheek implants specifically (augmentation rather than reduction), my search results focused more on reduction procedures.

In the United States, the average cost is $16,000, meaning cheekbone reduction in Thailand is about 78% less than in the U.S.(no content)Thai clinics usually include pre-op consultations, general anesthesia, the surgery itself, one or two nights of hospitalization, medications, and follow-up visits. In the U.S., the listed price often covers only the surgeon's fee, with anesthesia, facility, and aftercare billed separately.\n\n### Specific Clinic Pricing\n- B.Care Medical Center offers cheekbone reduction packages starting at 195,000 THB (approximately $5,400), covering surgery, 2 nights' deluxe accommodation with meals, pre-op checks, medications, and post-op care.\n- Some surgeons offer cheekbone reduction for around $3,000, typically covering surgery, anesthesia, recovery rooms, consultations, nursing care, medications, and one follow-up.\n\n### Procedure Details\nPatients with excessively prominent front cheekbones, broad cheekbones, and disproportionate or unbalanced facial structures benefit the most from cheekbone reduction. The surgery can remove or correct bone protrusions, making the facial line look sleeker, slimmer, softer, and much more attractive.(no content)The technique involves an L-shaped osteotomy or two-site osteotomy and rotation method with two incision scars - one intra-oral for the zygomatic body, and another in front of the ear behind the sideburn for the zygomatic arch.

These facilities are accredited by international organizations, such as the Joint Commission International.\n\n### The Procedure:\n- Facial fat transfer, also known as fat grafting, is a natural, minimally invasive surgical procedure that restores lost facial volume.

After making 2-3 small incisions, sized smaller than 2 cm and hidden behind the hairline, the plastic surgeon inserts a long thin tube with a light and a tiny camera (endoscope) through one of the incisions to visualize underlying muscles, tissues, vessels and nerves.(no content)In general, this procedure shortens the operation time to 1-2 hours. Since it requires only few small incisions, it results in faster healing time and less bruising and less damage to the surrounding nerves and tissues.\n\n### Available Techniques:\nAvailable options include Endoscopic brow lift, Temporal brow lift, and Coronal brow lift.\n\n### Recovery:\n- Most patients experience swelling and bruising for 1-2 weeks. Normal activities can usually be resumed within 10-14 days, with full healing over several weeks.\n- Results typically last between 5 to 10 years, depending on age, skin quality, and lifestyle.\n\n### Notable Clinics:\n- BKFL Clinic is a private medical center in Bangkok, Thailand, specializing in facial plastic surgery with a focus on advanced facelift procedures. Led by Dr. Palapong Chayangsu (Dr. Boat), the clinic is recognized for expertise in the deep plane facelift, often combined with treatments such as eyelid surgery, brow lifts, or fat grafting.\n- Rattinan Medical Center, located in Bangkok, Thailand, is a private multi-specialty clinic with over 25 years of experience, specializing in plastic surgery.
