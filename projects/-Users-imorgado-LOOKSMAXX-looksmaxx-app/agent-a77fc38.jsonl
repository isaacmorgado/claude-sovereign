Steiner) and the Downs analysis (named after William B. Downs).\n\n### Recent Advances (2024-2025)\n\n**AI and CNN-Based Landmark Detection:**\nCephalometric analysis is the primary diagnosis method in orthodontics. In our previous study, the algorithm was developed to estimate cephalometric landmarks from lateral facial photographs of patients with normal occlusion. This study evaluates the estimation accuracy by the algorithm trained on a dataset of 2320 patients with added malocclusion patients and the analysis values.(no content)Our new algorithm for estimating the landmarks from lateral facial photographs of malocclusion patients resulted in an error of less than 0.5 mm; the error in cephalometric analysis was less than 0.5°. Therefore, the algorithm can be clinically valuable.\n\n**New Benchmark Datasets:**\nAccurate identification and localization of cephalometric landmarks are crucial for diagnosing and quantifying anatomical abnormalities in orthodontics. Traditional manual annotation of these landmarks on lateral cephalograms (LCRs) is time-consuming and subject to inter- and intra-expert variability.(no content)Our dataset comprises 1,000 LCRs acquired from seven different imaging devices with varying resolutions, making it the most diverse and comprehensive collection to date. Each radiograph is meticulously annotated by clinical experts with 29 cephalometric landmarks, including the most extensive set of dental and soft tissue markers ever included in a public dataset.\n\n### Digital vs Manual Tracing\nDigital tracing using specialized software streamlines the cephalometric analysis process. The software automatically identifies anatomical landmarks on radiographs and calculates measurements. This also provides standards for comparison based on ethnicity, sex, and age while enabling predictions for soft tissue alterations, growth, and surgical outcomes.(no content)Both manual and digital tracing techniques are appropriate for cephalometric analysis. Average angular measurements and proportions are established for the general population, but these values serve as general guidelines. Standard measures may vary based on age, sex, and ethnicity.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"cd00d4f1-423b-4d07-b5d5-5f0c881a7445","timestamp":"2025-12-20T00:30:31.770Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"cephalometric analysis landmarks orthodontic side profile 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01K72SDJABX2SdiGqi1qSfgN","content":[{"title":"Orthodontics, Cephalometric Analysis - StatPearls - NCBI Bookshelf","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK594272/"},{"title":"Cephalometric analysis - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cephalometric_analysis"},{"title":"Accuracy of cephalometric landmark and cephalometric analysis from lateral facial photograph by using CNN-based algorithm | Scientific Reports","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-82230-z"},{"title":"A Beginners Guide to Lateral Cephalometric Radiographs","url":"https://www.dentalprotection.org/uk/articles/a-beginners-guide-to-lateral-cephalometric-radiographs"},{"title":"A Benchmark Dataset for Automatic Cephalometric Landmark Detection and CVM Stage Classification | Scientific Data","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-025-05542-3"},{"title":"A method of cephalometric evaluation.pdf","url":"https://media.dent.umich.edu/labs/mcnamara/files/A method of cephalometric evaluation.pdf"},{"title":"Fully Automatic System for Accurate Localisation and Analysis of Cephalometric Landmarks in Lateral Cephalograms | Scientific Reports","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/srep33581"},{"title":"Cephalometry in Orthodontics","url":"https://cephx.com/cephalometry-orthodontics/"},{"title":"Orthodontic Cephalometric analysis | PPTX","url":"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/orthodontic-cephalometric-analysis-221723016/221723016"},{"title":"Cephalometric Analysis in Orthodontics Using Artificial Intelligence—A Comprehensive Review - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9225851/"}]},"Here are the search results for \"cephalometric analysis landmarks orthodontic side profile 2025\":\n\n## Cephalometric Analysis in Orthodontics\n\n### Overview\nCephalometric analysis evaluates lateral skull radiographs obtained with a cephalostat to determine skeletal patterns and assess treatment complexity.(no content)Cephalometric analysis is an integral part of modern orthodontics practice, aiding in the diagnosis and treatment of various dental and skeletal anomalies.\n\n### Purpose and Applications\nIt is analysis of the dental and skeletal relationships of a human skull.

The SNA angle is formed by connecting the sella, nasion, and A-point.\n\n### Common Analysis Methods\nTwo of the more popular methods of analysis used in orthodontology are the Steiner analysis (named after Cecil C. Steiner) and the Downs analysis (named after William B. Downs).\n\n### Recent Advances (2024-2025)\n\n**AI and CNN-Based Landmark Detection:**\nCephalometric analysis is the primary diagnosis method in orthodontics. In our previous study, the algorithm was developed to estimate cephalometric landmarks from lateral facial photographs of patients with normal occlusion. This study evaluates the estimation accuracy by the algorithm trained on a dataset of 2320 patients with added malocclusion patients and the analysis values.(no content)Our new algorithm for estimating the landmarks from lateral facial photographs of malocclusion patients resulted in an error of less than 0.5 mm; the error in cephalometric analysis was less than 0.5°. Therefore, the algorithm can be clinically valuable.\n\n**New Benchmark Datasets:**\nAccurate identification and localization of cephalometric landmarks are crucial for diagnosing and quantifying anatomical abnormalities in orthodontics. Traditional manual annotation of these landmarks on lateral cephalograms (LCRs) is time-consuming and subject to inter- and intra-expert variability.(no content)Our dataset comprises 1,000 LCRs acquired from seven different imaging devices with varying resolutions, making it the most diverse and comprehensive collection to date. Each radiograph is meticulously annotated by clinical experts with 29 cephalometric landmarks, including the most extensive set of dental and soft tissue markers ever included in a public dataset.\n\n### Digital vs Manual Tracing\nDigital tracing using specialized software streamlines the cephalometric analysis process. The software automatically identifies anatomical landmarks on radiographs and calculates measurements. This also provides standards for comparison based on ethnicity, sex, and age while enabling predictions for soft tissue alterations, growth, and surgical outcomes.(no content)Both manual and digital tracing techniques are appropriate for cephalometric analysis. Average angular measurements and proportions are established for the general population, but these values serve as general guidelines. Standard measures may vary based on age, sex, and ethnicity."],"durationSeconds":30.8226579580009}}

In the analysis of a single film, the positions of the maxilla and mandible are related to cranial structures and to each other. Criteria for evaluation of the anteroposterior and vertical positions of the upper and lower incisors are provided, as is the documentation of the standards for each of the measures.\n\n## Five Sections of Analysis\n\nThe analysis divides the craniofacial skeleton into five sections: maxilla to cranial base, maxilla to mandible, mandible to cranial base, dentition, and airway. Linear measurements of landmarks and planes are compared to normative standards to assess relationships.\n\n## Key Landmarks\n\nThe major landmarks used in McNamara's analysis include: Nasion (N), sella (S), basion (Ba), porion (Po), orbitale (Or), anterior nasal spine (ANS), posterior nasal spine (PNS), pterygomaxillary fissure (PTM), point A (A), point B (B), pogonion (Pog), gnathion (Gn), menton (Me), gonion (Go), articular (Ar), condylion (Co), upper incisal apex (UIA), upper incisal edge (UIE), lower incisal edge (LIE), and lower incisal apex (LIA).\n\n## Key Measurements\n\nThe measurements used in McNamara cephalometric analysis include:\n1. A-N perpendicular (mm)\n2. Effective mandibular length (Co-Gn, mm)\n3. Effective midfacial length (Co-A, mm)\n4. Maxillo-mandibular difference (Mx-Md difference, mm)\n5.

Li-APog (mm)\n\n## Planes and Measurements for Skeletal Study\n\nAccording to McNamara, the skeletal and dental components of the face are composed of the following planes and measurements: Nasion perpendiculars (aka McNamara's Vertical), linear distance from point A to nasion perpendicular, linear distance from point pog to nasion perpendicular, maxillary length, mandibular length, and lower anterior facial height.(no content)The planes and measurements used for analysis of the airways are upper pharynx diameter and the lower pharynx diameter. The upper pharyngeal width is the smallest distance from the posterior pharyngeal wall to anterior half of the soft palate outline.\n\n## Advantages\n\nThere are three main advantages of the McNamara analysis. Firstly it depends largely on linear measurements rather than angles. It analyzes the interarch relationship in the vertical plane as well as sagittal making them into one single integrated unit. Lastly, it helps to diagnose external conditions in the airway.\n\n## Normative Standards\n\nStandards for this analysis were derived from 3 sources: lateral cephalograms of children comprising the Bolton standards, selected values from a group of untreated children from the Burlington Orthodontic Research Center, and 111 young adults from Ann Arbor, Michigan, having good to excellent facial configurations.(no content)McNamara's Jr. cephalometric analysis is a tool to diagnose dental and skeletal discrepancies and is widely used, guiding diagnosis for surgical procedures to be performed or for the use of functional devices.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"416be9c5-f202-47df-a284-3b85e1360908","timestamp":"2025-12-20T00:31:36.949Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"McNamara cephalometric analysis landmarks technique","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_018vL9s6p24VRr32jK7SDN8m","content":[{"title":"A method of cephalometric evaluation.pdf","url":"https://media.dent.umich.edu/labs/mcnamara/files/A method of cephalometric evaluation.pdf"},{"title":"Mc namara analysis | PPTX","url":"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/mc-namara-analysis-79980271/79980271"},{"title":"McNamara Analysis - CephX | AI Driven Dental Services","url":"https://cephx.com/mcnamara-analysis/"},{"title":"The landmarks and measurements used in McNamara cephalometric analysis.... | Download Scientific Diagram","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-landmarks-and-measurements-used-in-McNamara-cephalometric-analysis-1-1-A-N_fig3_44797328"},{"title":"McNamara analysis cephalometric parameters in White-Brazilians, Japanese and Japanese-Brazilians with normal occlusion - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8018756/"},{"title":"A method of cephalometric evaluation - American Journal of Orthodontics","url":"https://www.ajodo.org/article/S0002-9416(84)90352-X/abstract"},{"title":"The major landmarks used in McNamara’s analysis.

(2007) classified the faces into straight, convex, and concave. A convex profile indicates a skeletal Class II jaw relationship, whereas a concave profile indicates a skeletal Class III jaw relationship.\n\n### Vertical Facial Proportions\nThe face can be divided into thirds - the upper, middle, and lower third. The upper third is from hair line to Glabella point (above bridge of nose), the middle third is from the Glabella to the Subnasale, and the lower third is from the Subnasale to Menton (lowest point on chin).(no content)The part from the Subnasale to Stomion should be half the dimension from the Stomion to menton - in other words, the lower third facial height is further subdivided into a one third/two thirds proportion.\n\n### Horizontal Facial Proportions\nVertically, the face is split into fifths. Each eye occupies one fifth, the width between the eyes another fifth, and the breadth of the nasal base the last fifth. These measurements are vital for ensuring that dental corrections respect the natural symmetry of the face.\n\n### Angular Measurements\nAngular measurements measured by Peck and Peck in profilometric analysis in both vertical and horizontal dimensions include a maxillofacial angle, nasomaxillary angle, nasal angle, maxillary angle, and mandibular angle which yield characteristics of the esthetically pleasing profile.(no content)The proportion of the lower face can be defined within a narrow range. The Z angle measurement and the profile line give a critical description of lower face relationship and eliminate the vagueness of \"eye judgment.\"(no content)With normal FMA, IMPA, FMIA, and ANB measurements in the adult, the normal Z angle is 80 degrees.\n\n### Profile Line and Lip Position\nThe lip relation can be judged accurately by relating it to the profile line. The upper lip should be tangent to the line; the lower lip should be tangent or slightly behind the profile line.(no content)Measurement of the profile angle can identify and localize the chin point. Even though the length of the nose and the thickness of the lips and chin may vary, the proper chin position may eventually justify a pleasing facial profile among different ethnic origins.\n\n### Golden Ratio in Facial Aesthetics\nThe Golden Ratio, approximately 1.618, is used as a standard for aesthetic perfection. In facial aesthetics, it is applied to measure the ideal widths and heights of facial features. For instance, the width of the mouth is ideally φ times the width of the nose.\n\n### Facial Types Classification\nDolichocephalic (Long Face): It is a long and narrow face shape with a higher lower part. In individuals with long faces, the lower jaw grows downwards, and in this case, the chin appears further back.(no content)Brachycephalic (Short Face): A face type seen with a wide and short shape.

(2007) classified the faces into straight, convex, and concave. A convex profile indicates a skeletal Class II jaw relationship, whereas a concave profile indicates a skeletal Class III jaw relationship.\n\n### Vertical Facial Proportions\nThe face can be divided into thirds - the upper, middle, and lower third. The upper third is from hair line to Glabella point (above bridge of nose), the middle third is from the Glabella to the Subnasale, and the lower third is from the Subnasale to Menton (lowest point on chin).(no content)The part from the Subnasale to Stomion should be half the dimension from the Stomion to menton - in other words, the lower third facial height is further subdivided into a one third/two thirds proportion.\n\n### Horizontal Facial Proportions\nVertically, the face is split into fifths. Each eye occupies one fifth, the width between the eyes another fifth, and the breadth of the nasal base the last fifth. These measurements are vital for ensuring that dental corrections respect the natural symmetry of the face.\n\n### Angular Measurements\nAngular measurements measured by Peck and Peck in profilometric analysis in both vertical and horizontal dimensions include a maxillofacial angle, nasomaxillary angle, nasal angle, maxillary angle, and mandibular angle which yield characteristics of the esthetically pleasing profile.(no content)The proportion of the lower face can be defined within a narrow range. The Z angle measurement and the profile line give a critical description of lower face relationship and eliminate the vagueness of \"eye judgment.\"(no content)With normal FMA, IMPA, FMIA, and ANB measurements in the adult, the normal Z angle is 80 degrees.\n\n### Profile Line and Lip Position\nThe lip relation can be judged accurately by relating it to the profile line. The upper lip should be tangent to the line; the lower lip should be tangent or slightly behind the profile line.(no content)Measurement of the profile angle can identify and localize the chin point. Even though the length of the nose and the thickness of the lips and chin may vary, the proper chin position may eventually justify a pleasing facial profile among different ethnic origins.\n\n### Golden Ratio in Facial Aesthetics\nThe Golden Ratio, approximately 1.618, is used as a standard for aesthetic perfection. In facial aesthetics, it is applied to measure the ideal widths and heights of facial features. For instance, the width of the mouth is ideally φ times the width of the nose.\n\n### Facial Types Classification\nDolichocephalic (Long Face): It is a long and narrow face shape with a higher lower part. In individuals with long faces, the lower jaw grows downwards, and in this case, the chin appears further back.(no content)Brachycephalic (Short Face): A face type seen with a wide and short shape. The chin may be positioned behind or in front, or there may be deep closure in this area. In this case, the lower jaw grows forward.\n\n### Clinical Application\nFacial profile analysis is one of the assessments used to determine the diagnosis and orthodontic treatment plan by measuring an individual's face from the side view. In orthodontic treatment, soft tissue evaluation, especially the determination of facial profile, is an essential component used to assess the relationship between the jaws and teeth in order to establish a diagnosis and treatment plan."],"durationSeconds":32.339417624995114}}

It is one of the most important methods in assessing, tracking and diagnosing routine patient growth patterns in the craniofacial complex.(no content)The technique of cephalometric analysis according to Ricketts is an important tool in orthodontic diagnostics, which allows for accurate and comprehensive analysis of craniofacial structures.\n\n### History and Development\nRicketts published two papers in 1960 in which he showed his work of using cephalometric X-rays on 1000 patients in his clinic. Some of his contributions to the field of orthodontics included the first straight wire bracket .018 inch slot (1970), cephalometric analysis which allowed clinicians to compare their patients with norms based on age, sex, and race, and the first cephalometric system to forecast treatment results plus growth in treatment planning.\n\n### Key Measurements\nA system of five measurements from x-ray tracings was designed to provide a sensible method of informing the orthodontist of facial form and denture position. The five measurements were (1) the facial angle, (2) the XY axis angle, (3) the measure of contour, and (4 and 5) the relationship of the upper and lower incisors to the APo plane. These angles and measurements proved to be indicators of facial depth, facial height, and profile contour.(no content)The analysis outlines 11 parameters that provide an overview of a patient's craniofacial and dental growth patterns, including measurements of facial angle, convexity, lip position, and tooth inclination. The analysis orients the face and mandible to the cranium to understand a patient's growth and develop optimal treatment plans that integrate facial growth patterns.\n\n### Specific Parameters (Example Values from Research)\nBased on Ricketts' analysis, typical cephalometric measurements include: Facial axis: 85.7°, Facial depth: 88.6°, Mandibular plane angle: 27.4°, Mandibular arch: 34.2 mm, Convexity of point A: 4.1 mm, Denture height: 46.9 mm, L1 to A-Pog: 27.9°, L1 to A-Pog (linear measurement): 6.6 mm, Upper molar to PtV: 18.6 mm, Lower lip to E-plane: 2.1 mm.\n\n### Reference Planes and Landmarks\nThe Facial Axis is a line from PT point through cephalometric Gnathion which normally interacts BA-NA at right angles. The Cranial Base Plane is a line formed by connecting BA-NA; in normal Caucasians it forms 30° with the FH plane.(no content)The lower lip protrusion is evaluated by measuring the lower lip from an aesthetic line (E-line) constructed by joining the tip of the nose and the tip of the chin.\n\n### Purpose and Clinical Application\nThe purpose of the analysis encompasses the 4 C's of cephalometrics: 1. To characterize or describe the existing conditions. 2. To compare one individual with another or the same individual with himself at a later time. 3. To classify certain descriptions into various categories. 4. To communicate all these aspects to the clinician, to a fellow research worker, or to a parent.\n\n### Limitations\nA strong dependence of the method on such parameters as ethnicity, age, gender, and face type was revealed.(no content)Like any other transmission radiographs, lateral cephalometric radiographs collapse a three-dimensional structure into a two-dimensional plane. This results in difficult landmark identification especially for bilateral structures. Furthermore, due to non-parallel x-ray projection, structures more proximal to the x-ray source appear more magnified than those proximal to the detector.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c70c0fb0-8f27-47d5-9735-4d888895612b","timestamp":"2025-12-20T00:32:49.624Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Ricketts analysis cephalometric measurements orthodontic","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01PrpTDjmu8DxMydzY3wLVH2","content":[{"title":"(PDF) Ricketts cephalometric method in orthodontic diagnosis","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/382063738_Ricketts_cephalometric_method_in_orthodontic_diagnosis"},{"title":"A foundation for cephalometric communication - American Journal of Orthodontics","url":"https://www.ajodo.org/article/0002-9416(60)90047-6/abstract"},{"title":"Ricketts analysis | PPTX","url":"https://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/ricketts-analysis-249190342/249190342"},{"title":"Ricketts Analysis Using Conventional and DolphinTM ...","url":"https://scholarsrepository.llu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1418&context=etd"},{"title":"Cephalometric Analysis Findings Using the Ricketts Method in Orthodontic Patients at RSGM UMY | PROCEEDING IMPROVE QUALITY IN DENTISTRY","url":"https://prosiding.umy.ac.id/imunity/index.php/im/article/view/118"},{"title":"Ricketts cephalometric method in orthodontic diagnosis | Reports of Vinnytsia National Medical University","url":"https://reports-vnmedical.com.ua/index.php/journal/article/view/1277"},{"title":"Ricketts analysis /certified fixed orthodontic courses by Indian dental academy | PPT","url":"https://www.slideshare.net/indiandentalacademy/ricketts-analysis"},{"title":"Ricketts Cephalometric Analysis - Cephx","url":"https://cephx.com/ricketts-cephalometric-analysis/"},{"title":"Robert M.

Now I have comprehensive information to compile. Let me provide a thorough analysis report.\n\n## Comprehensive Analysis: Cephalometric Analysis in Orthodontics and Maxillofacial Surgery\n\nBased on extensive research, here's a detailed analysis of the cephalometric analysis field and how side profile landmark detection is performed professionally:\n\n---\n\n## 1. CRITICAL LANDMARKS FOR CEPHALOMETRIC ANALYSIS\n\n### Hard Tissue (Skeletal) Landmarks\n\nThe most essential landmarks used in professional cephalometric analysis include:\n\n**Cranial Base:**\n- **Sella (S)** - Center of the sella turcica (pituitary fossa)\n- **Nasion (N)** - Most anterior point of the frontonasal suture\n- **Basion (Ba)** - Most inferior point of the foramen magnum\n- **Porion (Po)** - Most superior point of the external auditory meatus\n- **Orbitale (Or)** - Lowest point of the orbital rim\n\n**Maxillary Landmarks:**\n- **Point A** - Deepest point of anterior concavity of maxilla\n- **Anterior Nasal Spine (ANS)** - Most anterior point of maxilla\n- **Posterior Nasal Spine (PNS)** - Posterior end of nasal septum\n\n**Mandibular Landmarks:**\n- **Point B** - Deepest point of anterior concavity of mandibular symphysis\n- **Pogonion (Pog)** - Most anterior/prominent point of chin\n- **Menton (Me)** - Most inferior point of mandibular symphysis\n- **Gonion (Go)** - Intersection of posterior ramus and lower border tangent lines\n- **Gnathion (Gn)** - Most anterior-inferior point of chin\n- **Articulare (Ar)** - Intersection of neck of condyle and posterior border of ramus\n- **Condylion (Co)** - Most superior point of mandibular condyle\n\n### Soft Tissue Landmarks\n\nProfessional analysis now includes extensive soft tissue evaluation:\n\n- **Pogonion' (Pog')** - Soft tissue chin prominence\n- **Menton' (Me')** - Soft tissue lower chin point\n- **Upper Lip (Ls)** - Labral superior (lip contour)\n- **Lower Lip** - Lower lip contour\n- **Subnasale (Sn)** - Point where nasal septum meets upper lip\n- **Columella Nasi (Cm)** - Tip of nose cartilage\n- **Soft tissue profile** - Nasal profile, lip protrusion\n\n---\n\n## 2. THE FRANKFORT HORIZONTAL PLANE\n\n### Definition and Importance\n\nThe **Frankfort Horizontal (FH) plane** is one of the most critical reference planes in cephalometric analysis. It is defined as the plane passing through:\n- **Bilateral Porions (PoR and PoL)** - The superior points of the external auditory meatus on both sides\n- **Left Orbitale (OrL)** - The lowest point of the left orbital rim\n\nThis plane represents the natural head position and has been the standard reference since the Frankfort Craniometric Agreement of 1882.\n\n### Clinical Application\n\n- **Frankfort Mandibular Angle (FMA):** Normal range is 25 ± 5 degrees\n  - High-angle patients: 30+ degrees\n  - Low-angle patients: 20 or fewer degrees\n- Used as reference for measuring skeletal and dental relationships\n- Alternative to S-N (Sella-Nasion) plane in Steiner analysis when orbitale and porion are difficult to identify\n\n### 3D Considerations\n\nRecent research emphasizes that the **definition of the FH plane significantly influences measurement interpretation** in 3D cephalometry. Studies show:\n- Significant and undesirable measurement differences can be produced by varying FH plane definition\n- \"Dental\" and \"foraminal\" landmarks are more reliable than conventional landmarks for establishing reference planes\n- Despite poor individual landmark reliability, the conventional FH plane provides reliable 3D reference for craniofacial orientation\n\n---\n\n## 3. MAJOR ANALYSIS METHODOLOGIES\n\nProfessional cephalometric analysis uses several established systems:\n\n### Steiner Analysis (1953)\n- Most commonly used method historically\n- **Reference plane:** S-N (Sella-Nasion)\n- **Key measurements:**\n  - SNA angle: Maxillary position relative to cranial base (normal ~82°)\n  - SNB angle: Mandibular position (normal ~80°)\n  - ANB angle: Maxillo-mandibular relationship (normal ~2°)\n  - Mandibular plane angle (GoGn to S-N): ~32°\n  - Occlusal plane angle to S-N: ~14°\n- **Three areas:** Skeletal, dental, soft tissue\n- **Steiner Line (S-line):** Measures lip protrusion from soft tissue profile\n\n### McNamara Analysis (1984)\n- Analyzes five sections: maxilla to cranial base, maxilla to mandible, mandible to cranial base, dentition, and airway\n- **Emphasizes linear measurements over angles**\n- **Key measurements include:**\n  - A-N perpendicular\n  - Effective mandibular length (Co-Gn)\n  - Maxillo-mandibular difference\n  - Lower anterior facial height (ANS-Me)\n  - Mandibular plane angle\n  - Facial axis angle\n  - Pogonion-N perpendicular\n- **Advantages:** Integrates vertical plane analysis with sagittal; evaluates airway\n\n### Ricketts Analysis (1969)\n- Computerized analysis system\n- **Key parameters:**\n  - Facial axis (85.7°)\n  - Facial depth (88.6°)\n  - Mandibular plane angle (27.4°)\n  - Convexity of point A (4.1 mm)\n  - L1 to A-Pog (incisor inclination)\n  - Lower lip to E-plane (aesthetic line)\n- **Unique feature:** Forecasts treatment results and growth patterns\n- **Five original measurements:** Facial angle, XY axis angle, contour measure, upper and lower incisor position to APo plane\n\n### Other Standard Methods\n- Downs analysis\n- Sassouni analysis\n- Jefferson analysis\n- Ricketts analysis\n\n---\n\n## 4. FACIAL PROPORTIONS IN SIDE PROFILE MEASUREMENT\n\nProfessional side profile analysis uses specific proportional guidelines:\n\n### Vertical Proportions (Thirds)\n- **Upper third:** Hairline to Glabella\n- **Middle third:** Glabella to Subnasale\n- **Lower third:** Subnasale to Menton\n  - Further subdivided: Upper lip (1/3) to lower lip and chin (2/3)\n\n### Horizontal Proportions (Fifths)\n- Each eye: 1/5 width\n- Inner eye space: 1/5\n- Nasal base width: 1/5\n- Each outer temple: 1/5\n\n### Angular Measurements for Profile\n- **Maxillofacial angle:** Relationship between maxilla and mandible\n- **Nasomaxillary angle:** Nasal and maxillary relationship\n- **Nasal angle:** Tip projection\n- **Mandibular angle:** Lower jaw contour\n- **Z-angle:** Critical for lower face profile (normal ~80°)\n- **Profile line:** Upper lip tangent to line; lower lip tangent or slightly behind\n\n### Facial Types\n- **Convex profile:** Indicates Class II skeletal relationship\n- **Straight profile:** Indicates Class I skeletal relationship\n- **Concave profile:** Indicates Class III skeletal relationship\n\n### Soft Tissue Profile Analysis\n- **Nasolabial angle:** Formed by nose base tangent and upper lip tangent\n  - Normal range varies by ethnicity\n  - Caucasian normal: ~102-110°\n  - Affected by orthodontic extraction treatment\n- **Profile evaluation includes:** Nasal projection, lip position, chin prominence, and overall facial convexity\n\n---\n\n## 5.

consider which one aligns with your goals\n\n4. **Modern approach:** Web-based, AI-assisted landmark detection with multi-stage refinement is now the professional standard\n\n5. **Soft tissue landmarks critical:** Professional tools emphasize soft tissue (nasal, lip, chin contour) in addition to hard tissue points\n\n6. **Cloud-native tools winning:** Commercial solutions (CephX, WeDoCeph, etc.) are replacing desktop software due to speed and consistency\n\n7. **3D not just 2D:** Moving from lateral cephalograms to 3D CBCT/volumetric analysis is the industry trend\n\n8. **Open datasets available:** The Aariz and CL-Detection datasets provide benchmarks for training and validation\n\nSources:\n- [Orthodontics, Cephalometric Analysis -
