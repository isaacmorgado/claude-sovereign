The term gets thrown around everywhere, but in reality it's just your features on a mathematical scale.(no content)Many other features go into an overall rating besides harmony, like masculinity, leanness, coloring, and features.\n\n**Angularity Score:** Angularity relates to facial leanness - a bloated face will have lower angularity.

Leaning down to lower body fat can significantly improve angularity scores.\n\n**Dimorphism Score:** DIMO describes how masculine a person is, with 0 being the closest to female-ish features, and 100 usually being a manly ogre.(no content)Dimorphism measurements relate to gonions, brow ridge, and canine fossa.\n\n### Example Scores\nOne user's FaceIQ report showed: harmony: 91.4%, front profile harmony: 96.6%, side profile harmony: 80.8%, features score: 7.64/10, dimorphism score: 6.71/10, angularity score: 6.75/10, symmetry: 89.2%, overall score: 7.75."],"durationSeconds":22.783125250004232}}

The female forehead is also more vertical while the male forehead tends to slope backwards a little.(no content)In adolescent faces, the prominence of the glabellar and brow ridges regions of males reaches a 2 mm protrusion compared to the female ones, as well as the nasal dorsum.(no content)Research found significant sexual dimorphism in the morphologies of the brow ridge and the chin, pointing out that men generally exhibited larger and more projecting brow ridges and chins compared with women.\n\n### Gonion (Jaw Angle) Measurements\n\nThe upper facial width was defined as the distance between the left and right zygoma. The lower facial width was the distance between the left and right gonion. The ratio between the upper and lower facial widths was calculated to describe the shape of the face.(no content)Typically, the male jawline is characterized by its greater width, squarer angle at the gonion (the angle of the jaw), and a more robust, often prominent, and squarer chin. This contrasts with the female jawline, which tends to be narrower, more tapered towards the chin, and often exhibits a softer, more rounded angle.(no content)In case of the male face, maximum variability was registered for tragus, gonion, gnathion, and moderate variability for trichion, glabella, nasion, subnasale, orbitale superius, and alare.\n\n### Key Measurement Methods\n\nfWHR (facial width-to-height ratio) is measured by dividing the distance from the left and right zygon by the distance between the upper lip and brow, putatively providing an index of mid-face robustness that is sexually dimorphic, being larger in men, on average, than women.(no content)Bizygomatic width is highly sexually dimorphic (equivalent d = 1.39), even after adjusting for 92 allometric measurements, including multiple facial height and other craniofacial measurements (equivalent d = 1.07).\n\n### Development of Masculine Features\n\nIn pubertal males, a high testosterone-to-oestrogen (T/E) ratio is thought to facilitate the lateral growth of the cheek-bones, mandibles and chin, the forward growth of the bones of the eyebrow ridges and the lengthening of the lower face leading to a more robust face shape.(no content)Compared to females, males had more oblique (i.e., sloped backwards) foreheads, more prominent supraorbital rims and glabellas, wider and larger noses, flatter cheeks, greater projection of the oral and mental regions, and more angular jawlines.

Each should be approximately 1/3rd of your entire face length (height between the hairline to bottom of the chin).(no content)These facial thirds should all be approximately equal to each other and dividable smoothly into 3 parts as you transition down the face.\n\n## Debate on Ideal Proportions\n\nThere's significant debate on whether equal thirds (33-33-33) are actually ideal:\n\n**Traditional View:**\nIdeally, the ratio of these sections should be 1:1:1.\n\n**Alternative View for Masculine Faces:**\nAccording to \"bluepilled sources,\" having facial thirds equal in height results in facial harmony. The problem is, \"balanced facial thirds\" theory is for females.

Each should be approximately 1/3rd of your entire face length (height between the hairline to bottom of the chin).(no content)These facial thirds should all be approximately equal to each other and dividable smoothly into 3 parts as you transition down the face.\n\n## Debate on Ideal Proportions\n\nThere's significant debate on whether equal thirds (33-33-33) are actually ideal:\n\n**Traditional View:**\nIdeally, the ratio of these sections should be 1:1:1.\n\n**Alternative View for Masculine Faces:**\nAccording to \"bluepilled sources,\" having facial thirds equal in height results in facial harmony. The problem is, \"balanced facial thirds\" theory is for females. These same proportions don't work for male faces.(no content)Some suggest ideal ratios for masculine faces follow a 25-30-45 rule (upper-middle-lower). The face on the right is divided vertically according to this rule of facial masculinity.(no content)Equal thirds are considered feminine by some.
