So, mediapipe works for landmark detection in marvel style movies if it is always going to analyze frontal images.\n\n## Technical Implementation\n\nThe `model_selection` parameter in MediaPipe can be used to choose between models:\n- `model_selection=0`: Short-range model (optimized for faces within 2 meters from the camera, better for selfie-style images)\n- `model_selection=1`: Full-range model (optimized for faces within 5 meters, generally better for various angles including some non-frontal views)\n\nIn summary, while MediaPipe's BlazeFace-based detection works well for frontal and near-frontal faces, its performance degrades significantly for profile views and faces turned away from the camera.

You can use this task to identify human facial expressions, apply facial filters and effects, and create virtual avatars.\n\n### Key Capabilities\n\nThe task outputs 3-dimensional face landmarks, blendshape scores (coefficients representing facial expression) to infer detailed facial surfaces in real-time, and transformation matrices to perform the transformations required for effects rendering.\n\n### Model Architecture\n\nThe Face Landmarker uses a series of models to predict face landmarks. The first model detects faces, a second model locates landmarks on the detected faces, and a third model uses those landmarks to identify facial features and expressions. The following models are packaged together into a downloadable model bundle: Face detection model (detects the presence of faces with a few key facial landmarks), Face mesh model (adds a complete mapping of the face - outputs an estimate of 478 3-dimensional face landmarks).(no content)The Blendshape prediction model receives output from the face mesh model and predicts 52 blendshape scores, which are coefficients representing different facial expressions.\n\n### 3D Face Transform\n\nThe MediaPipe Face Landmark Model performs a single-camera face landmark detection in the screen coordinate space: the X- and Y- coordinates are normalized screen coordinates, while the Z coordinate is relative and is scaled as the X coordinate under the weak perspective projection camera model. While this format is well-suited for some applications, it does not directly enable crucial features like aligning a virtual 3D object with a detected face. The newly introduced module moves away from the screen coordinate space towards a metric 3D space and provides the necessary primitives to handle a detected face as a regular 3D object.(no content)The face transform estimation module establishes a researcher- and developer-friendly semantic API useful for determining the 3D face pose and attaching virtual objects (like glasses, hats or masks) to a face. The new module establishes a metric 3D space and uses the landmark screen positions to estimate common 3D face primitives, including a face pose transformation matrix and a triangular face mesh. Under the hood, a lightweight statistical analysis method called Procrustes Analysis is employed to drive a robust, performant and portable logic.\n\n### Head Pose Estimation\n\nHead pose estimation is the process of determining the orientation of a person's head in three-dimensional space relative to a camera. This seemingly simple task has profound implications, enabling applications such as human-computer interaction, gaze tracking, and driver monitoring systems. The magic of head pose estimation hinges on the detection of facial landmarks — distinctive points on a person's face.(no content)MediaPipe excels in detecting facial landmarks, a cornerstone of head pose estimation. These landmarks encompass vital points such as the tip of the nose, the corners of the eyes, and the edges of the mouth.\n\n### 3D Landmark Details\n\nEach face is represented as a list of 468 face landmarks and each landmark is composed of x, y and z. x and y are normalized to [0.0, 1.0] by the image width and height respectively. z represents the landmark depth with the depth at center of the head being the origin, and the smaller the value the closer the landmark is to the camera. The magnitude of z uses roughly the same scale as x.\n\n### Platform Support\n\nFace Landmarker works with images, video files, and live video streams. The task handles the data input preprocessing, including resizing, rotation and value normalization.(no content)Face Landmarker code is available through the MediaPipe @mediapipe/tasks-vision NPM package for web applications, and the Face Landmarker task uses the com.google.mediapipe:tasks-vision library for Android.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e0ce572a-89ba-4c95-801a-6b1628cdd7b5","timestamp":"2025-12-20T00:04:47.398Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"MediaPipe Face Landmarker 3D head rotation profile detection","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01TLUigbr1wmeiegD82Ub1sF","content":[{"title":"Face landmark detection guide for Web | Google AI Edge | Google AI for Developers","url":"https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker/web_js"},{"title":"Face landmark detection guide | Google AI Edge | Google AI for Developers","url":"https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker"},{"title":"layout: forward target: https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker/ title: Face Mesh parent: MediaPipe Legacy Solutions nav_order: 2 — MediaPipe v0.7.5 documentation","url":"https://mediapipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solutions/face_mesh.html"},{"title":"Face landmark detection guide | MediaPipe | Google for Developers","url":"https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker"},{"title":"mediapipe/docs/solutions/face_mesh.md at master · google-ai-edge/mediapipe","url":"https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe/blob/master/docs/solutions/face_mesh.md"},{"title":"How to Visualise MediaPipe’s Face and Face Landmark Detection in 2D and 3D with Rerun - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/rerunio/how-to-visualise-mediapipes-face-and-face-landmark-detection-in-2d-and-3d-with-rerun-94f"},{"title":"MediaPipe 3D Face Transform - Google Developers Blog","url":"https://developers.googleblog.com/mediapipe-3d-face-transform/"},{"title":"Face landmark detection guide for Android | Google AI Edge | Google AI for Developers","url":"https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker/android"},{"title":"Face landmark detection guide for Web | MediaPipe | Google for Developers","url":"https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker/web_js"},{"title":"Real-Time Head Pose Estimation FaceMesh with MediaPipe and OpenCV: A Comprehensive Guide | by Jaykumaran R | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@jaykumaran2217/real-time-head-pose-estimation-facemesh-with-mediapipe-and-opencv-a-comprehensive-guide-b63a2f40b7c6"}]},"Here are the search results for \"MediaPipe Face Landmarker 3D head rotation profile detection\":\n\n## MediaPipe Face Landmarker Overview\n\nThe MediaPipe Face Landmarker task lets you detect face landmarks and facial expressions in images and videos.

However, there are several proven alternatives that handle profile views:\n\n---\n\n## Top 3 Recommended Solutions\n\n### 1. **Human.js Library** (BEST OPTION FOR YOUR USE CASE)\n\n**Package:** `@vladmandic/human`\n**NPM:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vladmandic/human\n**GitHub:** https://github.com/vladmandic/human\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n- **3D Head Rotation Tracking** - Detects and measures head rotation even at profile angles\n- **468 Face Landmarks** with 3D coordinates\n- **Built for non-frontal faces** - Explicitly handles rotated heads\n- **Multiple Backend Support** - WebGL, WASM, CPU (choose best for your hardware)\n- **Active Maintenance** - Last updated recently, compatible with latest TensorFlow.js\n- **All-in-one Solution** - Face detection, landmarks, pose estimation, emotion, age/gender\n\n**Quick Integration:**\n```javascript\nimport Human from '@vladmandic/human';\n\nconst human = new Human.Human({\n  backend: 'webgl', // or 'wasm' for WASM\n  modelBasePath: 'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@vladmandic/human/models/',\n});\n\n// Handles profile and frontal faces\nconst results = await human.detect(imageOrVideo);\nconsole.log(results.face); // Contains rotation, landmarks, pose\n```\n\n**Why it works for profiles:**\n- Includes head pose estimation (roll, yaw, pitch)\n- Automatically adjusts landmark detection based on head angle\n- 3D landmarks help with geometric calculations regardless of rotation\n- Designed specifically to handle \"face rotations\"\n\n---\n\n### 2. **YuNet + ONNX.js** (LIGHTWEIGHT, FAST)\n\n**Package:** `onnxruntime-web`\n**Model:** `face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx` (233 KB)\n**NPM:** https://www.npmjs.com/package/onnxruntime-web\n**GitHub Model:** https://huggingface.co/opencv/face_detection_yunet\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n- **Multi-directional face detection** - Detects faces looking in any direction\n- **Extremely lightweight** - Only 233 KB model file, <1MB with runtime\n- **Fast inference** - 1.6ms per frame on standard hardware\n- **ONNX Runtime Web** - Native browser support via WebAssembly\n- **No TensorFlow.js dependency** - Independent, lighter footprint\n\n**Quick Integration:**\n```javascript\nimport * as ort from 'onnxruntime-web';\n\n// Initialize session\nconst session = await ort.InferenceSession.create(\n  'face_detection_yunet_2023mar.onnx',\n  { executionProviders: ['wasm'] }\n);\n\n// YuNet outputs: locations, confidence, IoU\n// Works on faces at any angle\nconst feeds = { input: imageTensor };\nconst results = await session.run(feeds);\n```\n\n**Why it works for profiles:**\n- Explicitly designed for \"uncontrolled environments where faces would almost never look directly into the camera\"\n- Detects faces from all angles and directions\n- Returns bounding box coordinates independent of face orientation\n\n**Limitation:** Only provides face detection (bounding box), not landmark points. Would need secondary landmark model.\n\n---\n\n### 3. **MediaPipe Face Landmarker (Improved Version)**\n\n**Package:** `@mediapipe/tasks-vision`\n**GitHub:** https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe\n**Docs:** https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker/web_js\n\n**Key Improvements Over Face Mesh:**\n- **3D Face Transform Module** - Projects landmarks into metric 3D space\n- **Head Pose Estimation** - Uses landmarks to calculate rotation\n- **478 3D Landmarks** with transformation matrices\n- **Better robustness** - Newer generation model\n\n**Quick Integration:**\n```javascript\nimport { FaceLandmarker, FilesetResolver } from '@mediapipe/tasks-vision';\n\nconst faceLandmarker = await FaceLandmarker.createFromOptions(\n  await FilesetResolver.forVisionTasks(\n    'https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@mediapipe/tasks-vision@latest/wasm'\n  ),\n  { runningMode: 'VIDEO' }\n);\n\nconst results = faceLandmarker.detectForVideo(video, Date.now());\n```\n\n**Why it's still limited for profiles:**\n- Still primarily designed for frontal faces\n- Better than Face Mesh but not optimized for side profiles\n- Good fallback if Human.js isn't suitable\n\n---\n\n## Alternative: Hybrid Approach (MOST ROBUST)\n\nCombine face detection with landmark prediction:\n\n1. **Use YuNet for detection** - Works on any angle\n2. **Use Human.js for landmarks** - Handles the profile angles detected by YuNet\n\nThis ensures you detect all faces regardless of angle, then get accurate landmarks even when rotated.\n\n---\n\n## Performance Comparison\n\n| Solution | Profile Support | Landmarks | Bundle Size | Speed | Maintenance |\n|----------|-----------------|-----------|-------------|-------|-------------|\n| **Human.js** | ✅ Excellent | 468 3D | ~8MB | 30+ FPS | Active |\n| **YuNet + ONNX** | ✅ Excellent | 0 (detection only) | ~1MB | 60+ FPS | Active |\n| **MediaPipe Landmarker** | ⚠️ Limited | 478 3D | ~5MB | 30+ FPS | Active |\n| **MediaPipe Face Mesh** | ❌ Poor | 468 3D | ~3MB | 30+ FPS | Legacy |\n\n---\n\n## Concrete Implementation Path for Your Project\n\n1. **Immediate:** Replace MediaPipe Face Mesh with Human.js\n   - Install: `npm install @vladmandic/human`\n   - Update `/src/lib/mediapipeDetection.ts` to use Human.js instead\n   - Head rotation data is available in `results.face[0].rotation` (roll, yaw, pitch)\n\n2. **For Optimization:** Consider YuNet for first-stage detection\n   - Use YuNet to find faces at any angle\n   - Then apply Human.js only to detected regions for landmarks\n\n3. **Self-hosting WASM:** Both Human.js and YuNet support self-hosting\n   - Download models locally to `/public/wasm/`\n   - Set `modelBasePath` to your local path for reliability\n\n---\n\n## Resources\n\n- [Human.js GitHub](https://github.com/vladmandic/human)\n- [YuNet on OpenCV](https://huggingface.co/opencv/face_detection_yunet)\n- [ONNX Runtime Web Documentation](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/api/js/)\n- [MediaPipe Face Landmarker Web Guide](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker/web_js)\n\n---\n\n**Bottom line:** Human.js is your best option because it's specifically designed to handle head rotations and non-frontal faces while providing the detailed 3D landmarks you need for your analysis tool. It's actively maintained, well-documented, and battle-tested for exactly this use case.\n\nSources:\n- [Human.js NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vladmandic/human)\n- [Human.js GitHub Repository](https://github.com/vladmandic/human)\n- [MediaPipe Face Landmarker Documentation](https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker/web_js)\n- [YuNet Face Detection on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/opencv/face_detection_yunet)\n- [ONNX Runtime Web Documentation](https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/api/js/)\n- [TensorFlow.js Face Landmarks Detection](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@tensorflow-models/face-landmarks-detection)\n- [Face API.js NPM Package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@vladmandic/face-api)\n- [Frontal/Profile Face Detection](https://medium.com/@itsuki.enjoy/frontal-profile-face-detection-in-python-6bed8d196edf)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":7,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3230,"cache_read_input_tokens":22963,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3230,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":4,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGxk9NLX7bQ7FouovQ1A","type":"assistant","uuid":"edc37cb2-9dec-445f-9d95-e92aaacb5d12","timestamp":"2025-12-20T00:05:31.517Z"}
