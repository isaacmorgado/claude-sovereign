This angle plays a significant role in determining the shape and definition of your jawline.(no content)The gonial angle is the angle of the lower jaw and plays a crucial role in jawline aesthetics. A well-defined gonial angle is more square and prominent, while a rounded angle can make the face look softer and less defined.\n\n### Ideal Measurements\nThe gonial angle typically ranges from 120 to 130 degrees in adults.(no content)Some individuals seek to achieve a gonial angle closer to 90 degrees for a more defined appearance, either through natural methods like mewing and jaw exercises or through surgery.\n\n### Surgical Options\n\n**Gonial Angle Enhancement Surgery:**\nThe gonial angle can be surgically shaved or augmented to provide a more pronounced and squared jaw; this is usually performed along with mandibular angle augmentation. The benefit is a more powerful and chiseled jaw that amplifies facial masculinity or symmetry.\n\n**BSSO (Bilateral Sagittal Split Osteotomy):**\nThis surgery can result in a decrease in lower third height or increase in lower third height but with an increase in gonial notch visibility. Counter-clockwise rotation will increase the upswing of the face. This jaw surgery is often paired with a LeFort 1, which is then called a bimax.\n\n**Bimax Surgery:**\nBimax surgery with CCW rotation can involve significant movements - one patient reported 13° CCW rotation with nearly 30mm advancement in the lower jaw.(no content)If you have an overbite, a BSSO would help a lot. If you don't have an overbite, a specialized genioplasty, such as a mini wing genioplasty, would likely be sufficient. Wraparound jaw implants are another option, though osteotomies are often considered superior for the lower third.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\nThe optimal gonial angle depends on ramus length - if you have a short ramus you'll look better with a high gonial angle, if you have a long ramus then a lower gonial angle may be preferable.(no content)Features need to work harmoniously together. You need to consider almost every ratio on your face - if even one ratio strays drastically from the population average, you may end up looking uncanny.(no content)\"Dogmaxxing\" is a term used for bimax patients whose lower midface seems to be too far forward, giving them an uncanny profile. This mostly happens in patients who do not get enough CCW rotation and only get normal advancement.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"09959416-6183-4748-bcbb-69e51a9ef041","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:18:11.701Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"looksmax surgery recommendations based on facial analysis gonial angle jaw surgery","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_011d8PXoT1VLtB8hW6GwPn7c","content":[{"title":"takeaways from my jaw surgery | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/takeaways-from-my-jaw-surgery.936077/"},{"title":"Surgeries and what they do | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/surgeries-and-what-they-do.1167064/"},{"title":"Gonial Angle Looksmax: Transforming Your Jaw Aesthetics","url":"https://mewinghub.com/blogs/looksmaxing-blog/gonial-angle-looksmax-transforming-your-jaw-aesthetics"},{"title":"Can I fix my gonial angle? | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/can-i-fix-my-gonial-angle.821909/"},{"title":"Basic Jaw and Midface Osteotomy Guide | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/basic-jaw-and-midface-osteotomy-guide.477755/"},{"title":"What specifically should I ask for regarding jaw surgery | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/what-specifically-should-i-ask-for-regarding-jaw-surgery.1022442/"},{"title":"One surgery that will ascend most… | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/one-surgery-that-will-ascend-most.392580/"},{"title":"Your face is a puzzle - Surgerymaxxing without becoming uncanny. | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/your-face-is-a-puzzle-surgerymaxxing-without-becoming-uncanny.1622629/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's an overview of looksmax surgery recommendations related to facial analysis, gonial angle, and jaw surgery:\n\n## Gonial Angle and Jaw Surgery in Looksmaxxing\n\n### What is the Gonial Angle?\nThe gonial angle, also known as the mandibular angle, is the angle formed by the lower border of the mandible (jawbone) and the posterior border of the ramus (the vertical portion of the lower jaw).

The central idea behind PSL ratings is not purely finding one's SMV/appeal, but it can be better described as giving objective ratings based on Facial Harmony, Balance, Symmetry, Sexual Dimorphism, Unique qualities, and averageness.\n\n## Normal Distribution Model\n\nPSL Scale uses a normal distribution mindset where 4 PSL represents average, 5–6 PSL is above average to attractive, and 7+ PSL represents elite/model-level features.(no content)In this conceptualization of looks ratings, 4 PSL represents the median physical attractiveness for an individual of a certain sex, while 8 PSL means literal perfection. That means most people are near the median attractiveness (or the 50th percentile), 4 PSL, while a small minority of the population is 6 PSL or higher.(no content)It claims to measure attractiveness on a more normal distribution than the Decile chart commonly used by Normies to rate attractiveness, which is often claimed by proponents of the PSL scale to render inflated attractiveness ratings.\n\n## Scale Range and Tiers\n\nBecause a facial rating of 10 or even 9 doesn't exist, the PSL scale only ranges up to 8, with 4 serving as the midpoint.\n\nKey tiers include:\n- 4 PSL is dead average. Most men will be within this area (3.5-4.5), and it is the most common that you will see. Nothing will stand out about their faces, and nothing is noticeably ugly or unappealing.\n- A high tier normie (HTN) generally falls between 5 PSL to 6 PSL on this scale. High tier normies occupy this range, representing individuals who are considered attractive by most people but don't possess the exceptional features required for modeling or \"Chad\" status.\n- The people in the 7+ rating will be considered some of the best looking people in the world. Near-perfect facial symmetry, unique features, top-tier bone structure, and incredible facial Harmony is common in this rating. Only the top models and the best looking Hollywood actors out there belong in this category.\n- Those that are 7.5 PSL are the most attractive people of all time and 1 in a few billion. These people are usually where human facial aesthetics hit its full peak and in some candids these people look fake due to how developed, harmonic & how perfect their facial structure is.\n\n## Facial Harmony Criteria\n\nLooks are rated across four categories: \"harmony,\" the cohesiveness of one's features; \"dimorphism,\" how distinct you look from the opposite sex; \"angularity,\" the keenness of one's features, which correlates to low body fat; and \"miscellaneous features.\"(no content)The PSL system breaks down facial attractiveness into quantifiable metrics including: Harmony (alignment with the golden ratio 1.618:1, where features like eye spacing and jawline angles adhere to proportional ideals), Jawline Definition (a sharp, well-defined jawline with an angle >110° is considered optimal for masculinity), and Midface Ratio (balanced midface proportions signal genetic fitness).\n\n## Scientific Basis\n\nWhile PSL borrows concepts from aesthetic studies (e.g., the golden ratio, facial symmetry), it is not formally recognized in peer-reviewed research.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"2c011229-00fc-43c2-b45a-9fd917f53c9b","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:19:23.049Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"facial harmony percentile distribution attractiveness normal curve PSL scale","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01XSYCSpAhctnarYfv4oCMzP","content":[{"title":"PSL Scale Guide & Free PSL Test | Mewing.coach","url":"https://mewing.coach/blog/psl-scale"},{"title":"PSL rating - Incel Wiki","url":"https://incels.wiki/w/PSL_rating"},{"title":"PSL vs. SMV: Decoding the Metrics of Facial and Overall Attractiveness – Mewinghub","url":"https://mewinghub.com/blogs/looksmaxing-blog/what-is-psl-and-smv-in-looksmaxxing-understanding-key-metrics-of-attractiveness"},{"title":"PSL Scale - AI-Powered Facial Attractiveness Evaluation","url":"https://pslscale.com/"},{"title":"A Concise Guide for Evaluating PSL Ratings and Male Beauty Characteristics | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/a-concise-guide-for-evaluating-psl-ratings-and-male-beauty-characteristics.815024/"},{"title":"Complete Guide to PSL ratings | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/complete-guide-to-psl-ratings.379179/"},{"title":"What is the PSL Scale?
