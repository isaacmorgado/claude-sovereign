One user recounted her experience starting Latisse after years of struggling with short lashes that seemed almost invisible against her fair skin.\n\n### Potential Side Effects\nAccording to experts, side effects include eye irritation (redness and itching), darkening of the eyelid and iris color, hair growth outside of the lash line, allergic reactions, and potential long-term fat atrophy around the eyes, leading to a sunken, hollow appearance.(no content)One user reported using Latisse for about a year and experiencing significant orbital fat loss, saying they used to have almond eyes and now they are more round and older looking, with eyelashes also more fragile, thinner, and shorter than pre-Latisse.\n\n### Important Considerations\nIf you stop using Latisse, your lashes will gradually return to their original state over a few weeks or months.(no content)\"The big difference is that Latisse contains bimatoprost, an ingredient that's been scientifically proven to grow lashes and is FDA-approved for safety and effectiveness.\" While over-the-counter serums can condition and strengthen lashes, \"they won't actually stimulate growth like Latisse does.\"\n\nNote: While I searched specifically for Reddit SkincareAddiction discussions, the results returned more general reviews and experiences from various sources rather than specific Reddit threads from that subreddit.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8fb0eaf0-a185-48c8-9cc2-2756749e5903","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:29:10.047Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Latisse eyelash serum results before after reddit skincareaddiction","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01CtgousznpvGTRs6XhQr125","content":[{"title":"Latisse Lash Serum Before And After: Photos","url":"https://www.medsupplysolutions.com/blog/latisse/latisse-lash-serum-before-and-after/"},{"title":"Latisse Before and After Reddit - Oreate AI Blog","url":"https://www.oreateai.com/blog/latisse-before-and-after-reddit/"},{"title":"Latisse Review: I Tried the Prescription Eyelash Growth Serum","url":"https://www.cosmopolitan.com/style-beauty/beauty/a63118761/latisse-lash-serum-review/"},{"title":"Real Women Photos | LATISSE® Professional","url":"https://professional.latisse.com/before-and-after/photos"},{"title":"Reviewed: I Tried Latisse's Lash Serum—Here Are My Thoughts | Who What Wear","url":"https://www.whowhatwear.com/latisse-eyelash-serum-review"},{"title":"My Experience With Latisse | Before & After Pics – hotandflashy.com","url":"https://www.hotandflashy.com/experience-latisse-pics/"},{"title":"Latisse Before and After Eyelashes","url":"https://www.pinterest.com/ideas/latisse-before-and-after-eyelashes/947668793768/"},{"title":"Latisse: Before & After: What to Expect | Red Deer","url":"https://reddeereyecare.com/latisse-before-after-what-to-expect/"},{"title":"Latisse Reviews | Was it Worth It? | RealSelf","url":"https://www.realself.com/reviews/latisse"},{"title":"Before and After Latisse | TikTok","url":"https://www.tiktok.com/discover/before-and-after-latisse?lang=en"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about Latisse eyelash serum results and experiences:\n\n## Latisse Eyelash Serum: Results & Before/After Experiences\n\n### How Latisse Works\nLatisse is the only FDA-approved treatment clinically proven to achieve longer, fuller lashes, but it's only available via prescription from a doctor.(no content)The active ingredient, bimatoprost, significantly transforms thin or short lashes, making them more noticeable and darker.(no content)Latisse is approved by the FDA to treat inadequate eyelashes (hypotrichosis) and is also marketed under the brand name Lumigan for glaucoma treatment.

Both good haircuts and thick, long eyebrows/eyelashes can significantly improve your appearance.\n\n**Products recommended for growth:**\n\n1. **Castor Oil** - Available in every pharmacy and really cheap. While there are no clinical studies showing it promotes growth, it's worth trying due to its low cost.\n\n2. **Minoxidil** - Unlike castor oil, clinical studies show it works. It expands blood vessels reaching hair follicles, extends the anagen phase, and activates ATP-dependent potassium channels. The best option is 5% topical minoxidil since oral may cause bloating.\n\n3. **The Ordinary Lash Serum** - A multi-peptide serum that works well and has a decent price. It contains peptides and plant extracts that boost hair growth.\n\n4. **Bimatoprost (Latisse)** - Rated highly by users, it may double eyelash density AND length. Some report it can darken eye color as a side effect.\n\n### Eyebrow Grooming Tips\n\nEyebrow grooming is considered \"the EASIEST softmaxxing\" for eye area improvement. Key tools include face defuzzers to shave hairs between eyebrows and out-of-place ones on top (advice: never touch the outer edges of eyebrows or hairs growing below the eyebrow). Mascara wands are called \"the greatest tool for grooming any type of facial hair.\"(no content)Eyebrow/eyelash dye is rated 11/10 as it \"single-handedly ascended\" eye areas. It improves perceived eyebrow density and symmetry drastically.\n\n### Skincare Routine\n\nThe softmaxxing skincare strategy includes: using a cleanser to wash your face and remove extra oils, hydrating with moisturizer to maintain skin barrier function, using broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen to protect against UV damage (lessens chances of premature wrinkles), and optionally adding toner and/or serums.\n\n### Eye Area Improvements\n\nYou can improve upper eyelid show by using volufiline between your eyelid and eyebrow as it promotes fat growth, minimizing upper eyelid appearance. Alternatively, if eyelashes are long enough, you can curl them to cover the eyelid.(no content)For under-eye improvement, suggestions include hydration, dark circle treatments (vitamin C and caffeine), peptides like palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 or matrixyl that help stimulate collagen. Cold compresses or tea bags also reduce swelling and inflammation.(no content)Eyelash curling ($5-20) is an affordable method - simply using an eyelash curler daily. After curling, applying Vaseline can help prolong the curl throughout the day.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"616378f9-fcdc-4e23-84fb-cab751c84f79","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:29:11.650Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"looksmax forum softmaxxing guide skincare eyebrows eyelashes 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_012kH82XvZUSHeFGCriQC71X","content":[{"title":"The Only Facial Looksmaxxing Guide You'll Need: Softmaxxing & Hardmaxxing included | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/the-only-facial-looksmaxxing-guide-youll-need-softmaxxing-hardmaxxing-included.1447852/"},{"title":"EYELASH + EYEBROW MAXXING GTFIH | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/eyelash-eyebrow-maxxing-gtfih.1263673/"},{"title":"Why eyebrows and eyelashes are one of the best softmaxxes?

Key tools include face defuzzers to shave hairs between eyebrows and out-of-place ones on top (advice: never touch the outer edges of eyebrows or hairs growing below the eyebrow). Mascara wands are called \"the greatest tool for grooming any type of facial hair.\"(no content)Eyebrow/eyelash dye is rated 11/10 as it \"single-handedly ascended\" eye areas. It improves perceived eyebrow density and symmetry drastically.\n\n### Skincare Routine\n\nThe softmaxxing skincare strategy includes: using a cleanser to wash your face and remove extra oils, hydrating with moisturizer to maintain skin barrier function, using broad-spectrum SPF 30+ sunscreen to protect against UV damage (lessens chances of premature wrinkles), and optionally adding toner and/or serums.\n\n### Eye Area Improvements\n\nYou can improve upper eyelid show by using volufiline between your eyelid and eyebrow as it promotes fat growth, minimizing upper eyelid appearance. Alternatively, if eyelashes are long enough, you can curl them to cover the eyelid.(no content)For under-eye improvement, suggestions include hydration, dark circle treatments (vitamin C and caffeine), peptides like palmitoyl pentapeptide-4 or matrixyl that help stimulate collagen. Cold compresses or tea bags also reduce swelling and inflammation.(no content)Eyelash curling ($5-20) is an affordable method - simply using an eyelash curler daily. After curling, applying Vaseline can help prolong the curl throughout the day."],"durationSeconds":28.476611625000835}}

While not everyone loves their results, most reviewers are happy with their investment. Satisfied customers cite natural brow shapes, tiny hair strokes, and shades that created fuller, more youthful and symmetrical brows.\n\n## How Long Results Last\n\n- Results typically last 1-2 years, minimizing the need for daily brow makeup.\n- Healed microblading results last anywhere from 1-2 years, depending on your skin type. If you have oily skin, results usually fade a little faster than those with dryer skin types.\n\n## The Procedure\n\nMicroblading is a semi-permanent cosmetic technique that brings your eyebrows to life, giving them a fuller, more defined appearance. Using a specialized blade-like tool with tiny needles, the artist delicately mimics the look of natural hair by depositing pigment into your skin.(no content)Microblading is a two session process, the first session takes approximately 2.5 hours, and the second is 1 hour.\n\n## Aftercare\n\nThe microblading healing process includes specific aftercare steps like avoiding water, sun, and certain skincare products for about 10 days.(no content)Microblading pigments naturally fade, and having oily skin can hasten the process. Using skincare products that contain retinol or alpha and beta hydroxy acids have also been linked to premature fading, so it's best to avoid them in the brow area.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"2907a895-0aaf-4363-bdbb-fd3057ec6fc5","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:29:40.976Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"microblading eyebrows men before after cost results 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_018CCzCmsXLHARfyYfuJ64P9","content":[{"title":"What is Microblading Eyebrows: Cost, Pros & Expert Tips 2024","url":"https://www.divinethreading.com/what-is-microblading-eyebrows-cost-pros-and-cons-2024/"},{"title":"Microblading 2025: Benefits, Cost, and Its Alternatives","url":"https://www.denefits.com/microblading-benefits-cost-and-its-alternatives/"},{"title":"Microblading Before and After Pictures (2024): Best Results","url":"https://www.pmuhub.com/microblading/microblading-before-and-after/"},{"title":"How Much Does Microblading Cost?

The severity of hair loss was Hamilton Norwood II-VII for male subjects and Ludwig I-III for female subjects.(no content)A more recent meta-analysis (with search up to September 2024) identified 12 RCTs involving 631 AGA patients and found that combined microneedling with minoxidil therapy (CMNT) significantly improved hair count compared to minoxidil monotherapy (SMD 1.32, 95% CI 0.73–1.92, p < 0.01).(no content)Another 2024 meta-analysis with eight studies involving 472 participants found that compared with 5% topical minoxidil therapy, microneedle plus minoxidil treatment showed a significant increase in hair count (SMD: 15.82, 95% CI: 12.34-19.31, p < 0.05), but no increase in hair diameter.\n\n### Combination Therapy Results\n\nMeta-analysis showed that the combination of PRP and micro-needling significantly increased hair density (mean difference: 18.9 hairs/cm², 95% CI: 15.3-22.5, p < 0.001) and hair thickness (mean difference: 0.4 mm, 95% CI: 0.3-0.5, p < 0.01) compared to controls.(no content)One notable study found that 82% of participants who used microneedling with Minoxidil reported hair improvements of more than 50%, compared with just 4.5% of those using Minoxidil alone. Investigators also noted that the change in average hair count was four times higher in those using derma rolling together with Minoxidil.\n\n### Mechanism of Action\n\nMicroneedling works by stimulation of stem cells and inducing activation of growth factors.(no content)In murine models, microneedle stimulation affects hair growth and upregulates hair growth-related genes. Among various lengths and cycles, 0.25 mm/10 cycles and 0.5 mm/10 cycles were the most effective. The Wnt/β-catenin signaling pathways and VEGF were upregulated after microneedle stimulation.\n\n### Treatment Parameters\n\nStudies used various types of microneedles: eight studies used electrodynamic microneedles, three used rolling microneedles, one used a home-use type with spiral-grooved needles, and one used fractional radiofrequency microneedle. Nine studies described microneedle depths ranging from 0.25 to 2.50 mm.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThere are limited studies that investigate microneedling as a monotherapy for hair loss since the majority of trials combine it with other therapies such as topical minoxidil or platelet-rich plasma. While preliminary results look promising, further investigation of microneedling as a monotherapy in larger, randomized controlled trials will help determine its safety and efficacy.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"18233de5-397b-42e7-af9a-983995cc2c2f","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:29:41.527Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"dermarolling microneedling hair regrowth results scientific studies 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01ToVKFtrjVnpyWQTSLq6k56","content":[{"title":"A Randomized Evaluator Blinded Study of Effect of Microneedling in Androgenetic Alopecia: A Pilot Study - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3746236/"},{"title":"A randomized evaluator blinded study of effect of microneedling in androgenetic alopecia: a pilot study - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23960389/"},{"title":"Efficacy and safety of combined microneedling therapy for androgenic alopecia: A systematic review and meta‐analysis of randomized clinical trials - Pei - 2024 - Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology - Wiley Online Library","url":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jocd.16186"},{"title":"Evaluating the efficacy and safety of combined microneedling therapy versus topical Minoxidil in androgenetic alopecia: a systematic review and meta-analysis | Archives of Dermatological Research","url":"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00403-025-04032-1"},{"title":"Microneedling for Hair Loss - PubMed","url":"https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34714971/"},{"title":"Effect of Microneedle on Hair Regrowth in","url":"https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.1055/s-0044-1782181.pdf"},{"title":"Advances in microneedles research based on promoting hair regrowth - ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168365922008549"},{"title":"Repeated Microneedle Stimulation Induces Enhanced Hair Growth in a Murine Model - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5064188/"},{"title":"Derma Roller For Hair Growth: Expert Review 2025 - Wimpole Clinic","url":"https://wimpoleclinic.com/blog/derma-roller-for-hair-growth-expert-review/"},{"title":"Use of growth factor concentrate using derma roller in treatment of androgenetic alopecia: A literature review - J Dent Spec","url":"https://www.jdsits.in/html-article/22840"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what scientific studies show about dermarolling/microneedling for hair regrowth:\n\n## Key Scientific Findings\n\n### Meta-Analyses and Systematic Reviews (2024)\n\nA 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis published in the Journal of Cosmetic Dermatology enrolled a total of 696 AGA subjects, aged 18–60 years, in 13 RCTs.

This can result in bloating and puffiness due to a temporary shift in the water balance in your body, but this is not the same as real weight gain.(no content)Minoxidil's use in hypertension is limited by several serious side effects, including fluid retention causing or worsening heart failure, severe reflex tachycardia leading to angina or even myocardial infarction, pericardial effusion/tamponade, hypotension, and shock.(no content)Oedema (fluid retention) is very rare at the lower doses used for hair loss. If mild swelling occurs, reducing salt intake and staying active can help balance fluid retention.\n\n### Heart-Related Side Effects\nMinoxidil may cause fluid retention and increase your risk of heart failure.(no content)Minoxidil may cause a fast heartbeat, which can lead to chest pain.(no content)The most frequently reported side effects were hypertrichosis, tachycardia, pericarditis, and an abnormal ECG.(no content)Minoxidil can cause salt and water retention. This can lead to congestive heart failure.\n\n### Timing of Fluid Retention\nThe three month time point is the latest point at which most people will have experienced swelling if it is going to occur. In other words, if swelling and fluid retention has not occurred by month 3, there is a very high likelihood it will not occur. That's why patients are advised to wait three months before making dose adjustments.\n\n### Warning Signs to Watch For\nWhile taking minoxidil, weigh yourself every day. A weight gain of 2 to 3 pounds (about 1 kg) in an adult is normal and should be lost with continued treatment. However, if you suddenly gain 5 pounds (2 kg) or more (for a child, 2 pounds [1 kg] or more) or if you notice swelling of your feet or lower legs, check with your doctor right away.\n\n### Case Reports\nAuthors from South Africa presented a case highlighting the possibility of significant fluid retention causing pericardial and pleural effusions in a healthy woman. The case involved an otherwise healthy 40-year-old African woman who developed pericardial, pleural effusion and anasarca 3 weeks after low-dose oral minoxidil therapy, even at an extremely low dose of 0.25 mg daily.\n\nNote: While my search included Reddit in the query, the results primarily returned medical and clinical sources rather than Reddit discussions.

On the other hand, if your hair feels rough, dry, frizzy, or brittle, it's craving moisture.(no content)Pay attention to how your hair behaves after washing—this can help you identify what it needs most. Dry hair lacks hydration and needs moisturizing hair care, while damaged hair has weakened protein bonds and requires protein treatments for recovery.(no content)One of the biggest struggles for curly and coily heads is figuring out the right protein moisture balance. Conquering this mixture balance is important so that your hair isn't weighed down or overly fragile.\n\n## Key Hair Care Routine Tips for Men\n\n### Conditioning & Moisture\nConditioners provide vital hydration that locks in moisture, resulting in softness and manageability, which contributes to styling success later on in the routine. Concentrate on mid-lengths to ends, ensuring all areas receive even coverage. Let the conditioner sit on your hair for around 2 minutes before rinsing well.(no content)A good treatment restores moisture and keeps your hair looking smooth. Treat yourself to a weekly deep conditioner or hair mask especially if your hair feels dry.\n\n### Washing Frequency\nThere's no strict rule to follow, but you should wash your hair with shampoo and conditioner no more than three times a week. You can give your hair a refresh with a blast of water in between, but you should avoid using shampoo and conditioner every day to promote a healthy scalp. Your hair produces natural oils that help keep your scalp and hair moisturised, so frequent washing can strip away those natural oils.\n\n### Products with Protein\nThickening Conditioner uses ingredients like vitamin B5, wheat protein and caffeine to nourish hair.(no content)Biotin supports hair growth, density and retention, and promotes protein production for healthy follicles and stronger strands.\n\n### DIY Protein & Moisture Treatment\nWhisk one egg with a tablespoon of olive oil and apply to damp hair. Rinse with cool water after 20 minutes. This combination boosts protein and moisture, especially helpful for dry or damaged hair.\n\n### Hair Type Considerations\nGents with coily, curly, and kinky hair should opt for hearty moisturizers that can penetrate denser hair, while guys with straight or wavy hair should opt for lightweight shampoo and conditioners.(no content)Too-frequent shampooing can dry out and break your curls. Wash 2–3 times per week with a moisturizing shampoo.\n\nNote: The search didn't return specific Reddit discussions on this topic, but the general haircare guidance above covers the protein-moisture balance principles that are commonly discussed in haircare communities.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4d13f58d-7e47-42d0-8c50-441e650cc29c","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:30:15.284Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"hair care routine men protein moisture balance reddit haircare 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01FxLf5foPHzccxTJPZDToZw","content":[{"title":"7 Hair Care Tips For Men | Brickell Men's Products","url":"https://brickellmensproducts.com/blogs/grooming-manual/7-haircare-tips-for-men"},{"title":"Ultimate Men's Hair Care Guide | Scotch Porter","url":"https://www.scotchporter.com/blogs/news/ultimate-hair-care-guide-for-men"},{"title":"The Best Hair Care Regimen for Men","url":"https://cardonskin.com/blogs/mens-skincare-tips/mens-hair-care-101"},{"title":"The Only Men's Haircare Routine You Need: 4 Simple Steps | Salt Grooming","url":"https://www.saltgrooming.com/blogs/blog/hair-care-routine-for-men"},{"title":"Ultimate Hair Care Guide For Men | Hair Doctors","url":"https://www.hairdoctors.com.au/blog/hair-care-for-men/"},{"title":"Men's Hair Care Routine for Any Hair Type | The Beard Club","url":"https://thebeardclub.com/blogs/beard-culture/mens-hair-care-routine"},{"title":"The Ultimate Hair Care Routine For Men with All Hair Types | Blu Atlas","url":"https://bluatlas.com/blogs/blog/the-ultimate-hair-care-routine-for-men-for-all-hair-types"},{"title":"Hair Care for Men | Good Health by Hims","url":"https://www.hims.com/blog/mens-hair-care-tips"},{"title":"Protein Moisture Balance 101 – Donna's Recipe","url":"https://www.donnasrecipe.com/blogs/donnas-blog/protein-moisture-balance-101"},{"title":"Protein vs Moisture for Hair: How to Know What Your Hair Really Needs","url":"https://www.clinikally.com/blogs/news/protein-vs-moisture-for-hair-what-your-hair-needs"}]},"Based on my search results, here's information about hair care routines for men focusing on protein-moisture balance:\n\n## Protein vs. Moisture Balance\n\nIf your hair feels stretchy, limp, or breaks easily when wet, it likely needs protein to rebuild strength.

Designed for use twice daily, this serum features a blend of 11 key ingredients, including four peptide complexes and plant extracts.(no content)The Ordinary's serum contains a number of peptides from which it gets its name. Myristoyl pentapeptide-17 was shown in a clinical trial published in the Journal of Clinical and Aesthetic Dermatology to have the potential to stimulate eyelash growth.\n\n## User Results & Reviews\n\n**Timeline for Results:**\nVisible improvements in lash and brow volume and fullness can typically be seen after 4 weeks of consistent use.(no content)Most users report visible improvements in 4-6 weeks with consistent twice-daily application, though optimal results typically appear after 8 weeks of regular use.\n\n**Positive Experiences:**\n- \"Before, my lashes looked wispy and uneven but after using the serum, the shorter lashes especially in the outer half of my eyelid really looks fuller.

The serum added volume to the base of lashes while boosting a bit of length too.\n\n- After nearly two months of using the serum, one editor started to see the faintest new growth sprouting toward the inner corner of their brow. However, they couldn't say for sure they noticed dramatic growth yet.\n\n- One tester noted that after a month they started to see some results in the health of their lashes, though the applicator started to splay slightly which reduced accuracy over time.\n\n**Mixed/Moderate Results:**\nOne product tester found that \"The Ordinary lash serum provided measurable improvement, but not as dramatic as the two most expensive brands I've tried previously.\" They experienced mild irritation—a bit of flakiness on the eyelids—and adjusted to using it every other day, which reduced the irritation while maintaining results.(no content)Another reviewer stated that after using it for a month, they couldn't say they had seen noticeable results but planned to keep using it.\n\n## Application Tips\n\nFor best results, apply the Multi-Peptide Lash and Brow Serum twice—in your AM and PM routines.

However, the side effects are reversible and occur in less than 2% of men.\n\n### Clinical Trial vs. Real-World Data\nIn controlled clinical trials for AGA, the incidence of drug-related sexual side effects (such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, reduced ejaculate volume) is relatively low – on the order of 2% or less, which is only slightly higher than in men taking placebo.(no content)However, post-marketing experience and independent studies suggest somewhat higher rates in real-world use. One one-year study found that 15% of men on finasteride reported sexual adverse effects vs 7% on placebo.\n\n### Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)\nA 2023 article in the International Journal of Impotence Research has fueled online debate over a phenomenon known as post-finasteride syndrome. The syndrome is linked to decreased libido, erectile dysfunction or even cognitive difficulties.(no content)Case series of PFS have documented men with prolonged sexual dysfunction, where symptoms like low libido and ED lasted for months or years after stopping finasteride. While the existence and frequency of PFS are debated, regulatory agencies have added warnings about potential persistent sexual side effects.\n\n### The Nocebo Effect\nA study aimed to determine whether the sexual side effects of finasteride are related to a nocebo effect. The study found that patients who were informed of the drug's sexual side effects reported a significantly higher proportion of sexual dysfunction compared to those who were not informed. The study suggests that the nocebo effect should be taken into account when managing finasteride sexual side effects.\n\n### Doctor Perspectives\nMore young men are taking a medication to prevent hair loss, prompting some concerns that the oral drug has been linked to rare but potentially long-lasting side effects. A report by Epic Research, conducted on behalf of NBC News, found that the number of men in the U.S. with finasteride prescriptions increased nearly 200% in the last seven years.(no content)\"I'm very cautious if a person tells me they're having issues with sexual function,\" one doctor said. \"I usually say I don't think this is a good idea and I wouldn't recommend it for them.\" Dr. Shapiro says the risk of permanent side effects is \"so, so rare\" and notes \"I've never seen it in a patient, and I've treated thousands of patients.\"(no content)According to one dermatologist, \"Certainly the vast majority of my patients have no such side effects and are fine and do pretty well with it.\"\n\n### r/Tressless Community Discussions\nFinasteride can cause sexual side effects like reduced libido and weaker erections, but experiences vary. Some users switch to dutasteride or topical treatments, while others stop finasteride to restore normal sexual function.(no content)The community discusses the side effects of finasteride, including low libido and erectile dysfunction, and the possibility of these effects being permanent. Some users report personal experiences with PFS and debate whether the condition is real, with varying opinions on the reversibility of side effects.\n\n### Mental Health Considerations\nThere is also a link to mental health effects, including depression. However, it's unclear how common those are and if the drug itself is to blame.(no content)Some users report mood swings, depression, or anxiety.

However, the side effects are reversible and occur in less than 2% of men.\n\n### Clinical Trial vs. Real-World Data\nIn controlled clinical trials for AGA, the incidence of drug-related sexual side effects (such as decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, reduced ejaculate volume) is relatively low – on the order of 2% or less, which is only slightly higher than in men taking placebo.(no content)However, post-marketing experience and independent studies suggest somewhat higher rates in real-world use. One one-year study found that 15% of men on finasteride reported sexual adverse effects vs 7% on placebo.\n\n### Post-Finasteride Syndrome (PFS)\nA 2023 article in the International Journal of Impotence Research has fueled online debate over a phenomenon known as post-finasteride syndrome. The syndrome is linked to decreased libido, erectile dysfunction or even cognitive difficulties.(no content)Case series of PFS have documented men with prolonged sexual dysfunction, where symptoms like low libido and ED lasted for months or years after stopping finasteride. While the existence and frequency of PFS are debated, regulatory agencies have added warnings about potential persistent sexual side effects.\n\n### The Nocebo Effect\nA study aimed to determine whether the sexual side effects of finasteride are related to a nocebo effect. The study found that patients who were informed of the drug's sexual side effects reported a significantly higher proportion of sexual dysfunction compared to those who were not informed. The study suggests that the nocebo effect should be taken into account when managing finasteride sexual side effects.\n\n### Doctor Perspectives\nMore young men are taking a medication to prevent hair loss, prompting some concerns that the oral drug has been linked to rare but potentially long-lasting side effects. A report by Epic Research, conducted on behalf of NBC News, found that the number of men in the U.S. with finasteride prescriptions increased nearly 200% in the last seven years.(no content)\"I'm very cautious if a person tells me they're having issues with sexual function,\" one doctor said. \"I usually say I don't think this is a good idea and I wouldn't recommend it for them.\" Dr. Shapiro says the risk of permanent side effects is \"so, so rare\" and notes \"I've never seen it in a patient, and I've treated thousands of patients.\"(no content)According to one dermatologist, \"Certainly the vast majority of my patients have no such side effects and are fine and do pretty well with it.\"\n\n### r/Tressless Community Discussions\nFinasteride can cause sexual side effects like reduced libido and weaker erections, but experiences vary. Some users switch to dutasteride or topical treatments, while others stop finasteride to restore normal sexual function.(no content)The community discusses the side effects of finasteride, including low libido and erectile dysfunction, and the possibility of these effects being permanent. Some users report personal experiences with PFS and debate whether the condition is real, with varying opinions on the reversibility of side effects.\n\n### Mental Health Considerations\nThere is also a link to mental health effects, including depression. However, it's unclear how common those are and if the drug itself is to blame.(no content)Some users report mood swings, depression, or anxiety. In 2017, the UK's MHRA issued a warning that finasteride has been associated with depressed mood, depression, and suicidal thoughts, though a direct causal link is unclear.\n\n### Topical vs. Oral Finasteride\nOverall, topical finasteride's side effect profile appears more favorable than oral finasteride's. Most users do not experience systemic side effects, and those who do often report them as milder. A published literature review stated: \"Topical finasteride reduces the potential for systemic side effects, including the risk of sexual dysfunction.\""],"durationSeconds":35.413781082995236}}
