    82→**The Basic Math:**
    83→- Calories In > Calories Out = Weight Gain
    84→- Calories In < Calories Out = Weight Loss
    85→- Calories In = Calories Out = Maintenance
    86→
    87→**Finding Your Maintenance:**
    88→Method 1: Calculator estimate
    89→- TDEE calculator gives starting point
    90→- Typically 14-17 x bodyweight (in lbs)
    91→- Active people higher, sedentary lower
    92→
    93→Method 2: Track and observe
    94→- Eat the same for 2 weeks
    95→- Track weight daily, average weekly
    96→- Stable = maintenance. Rising = surplus. Dropping = deficit.
    97→
    98→**Setting Your Target:**
    99→
   100→| Goal | Calorie Target |
   101→|------|---------------|
   102→| Fat Loss | Maintenance - 300-500 |

   105→| Standard Bulk | Maintenance + 400-500 |

   121→
   122→**Why Protein Is King:**
   123→- Builds and preserves muscle
   124→- Most satiating macro (keeps you full)
   125→- Highest thermic effect (burns calories to digest)
   126→- Hardest to store as fat
   127→
   128→**How Much:**
   129→- Minimum: 0.7g per pound of bodyweight
   130→- Optimal: 0.8-1g per pound of bodyweight
   131→- Upper limit: More than 1.2g/lb has no additional benefit
   132→
   133→**For a 180lb Guy:**
   134→- Minimum: 126g daily
   135→- Optimal: 144-180g daily
   136→
   137→**Best Protein Sources:**
   138→
   139→| Source | Protein per 100g |
   140→|--------|-----------------|
   141→| Chicken breast | 31g |

   145→| Eggs | 13g |
   146→| Cottage cheese | 11g |
   147→| Whey protein | 80g |
   148→
   149→**Hitting It Daily:**
   150→- Each meal should have a protein source
   151→- 30-50g per meal, 3-4 meals
   152→- Fill gaps with protein shakes if needed
   153→- Front-load protein earlier in day for satiety`,

   160→
   161→**Fats: The Minimum**
   162→- Never go below 0.3g/lb bodyweight
   163→- Fats are essential for hormones (testosterone)
   164→- Too low = hormone problems, brain fog, bad skin
   165→- For 180lb: minimum 54g fat daily
   166→
   167→**Carbs: The Performance Fuel**
   168→- Not "essential" but highly beneficial for training
   169→- Fill remaining calories after protein and fat
   170→- More carbs = better gym performance
   171→- Lower carbs = some people do better for fat loss
   172→
   173→**Setting Macros (Example: 180lb guy, 2500 calories)**
   174→
   175→Option 1: Moderate carb (recommended)
   176→- Protein: 180g (720 cal)
   177→- Fat: 80g (720 cal)
   178→- Carbs: 265g (1060 cal)
   179→
   180→Option 2: Lower carb
   181→- Protein: 180g (720 cal)
   182→- Fat: 100g (900 cal)
   183→- Carbs: 220g (880 cal)
   184→
   185→Option 3: Higher carb (athletic)
   186→- Protein: 180g (720 cal)
   187→- Fat: 60g (540 cal)
   188→- Carbs: 310g (1240 cal)
   189→
   190→**The Truth:**
   191→For most people, the exact ratio doesn't matter much. Hit protein, stay in your calorie range, and adjust carbs/fats based on preference and how you feel.`,

   203→This keeps you sane while getting results.

   205→**Whole Foods (Prioritize These):**
   206→
   207→**Proteins:**
   208→- Chicken, turkey, lean beef, fish
   209→- Eggs, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese
   210→- Whey/casein protein powder
   211→
   212→**Carbs:**
   213→- Rice, potatoes, oats
   214→- Fruits, vegetables
   215→- Whole grain bread/pasta
   216→
   217→**Fats:**
   218→- Olive oil, avocados
   219→- Nuts, seeds
   220→- Fatty fish (salmon)
   221→- Eggs
   222→
   223→**Minimize (Not Eliminate):**
   224→- Fried foods
   225→- Sugary snacks and drinks
   226→- Processed meats regularly
   227→- Alcohol (empty calories + lowers testosterone + disrupts sleep)
   228→
   229→**The Why:**
   230→Whole foods are more filling per calorie, have more micronutrients, and are harder to overeat. You can lose weight on junk food (calories are calories), but you'll be hungrier and less healthy.`,

   254→
   255→1. **Pre-Workout (1-2 hours before)**
   256→   - Carbs + protein = better performance
   257→   - Don't train completely fasted if you can help it
   258→   - Something > nothing
   259→
   260→2. **Post-Workout (within 2-3 hours)**
   261→   - Protein helps start recovery
   262→   - The "anabolic window" is way longer than old bro-science claimed
   263→   - Just eat normally, don't stress
   264→
   265→3. **Before Bed**
   266→   - Casein or slow protein can help overnight recovery
   267→   - Not essential, just nice
   268→
   269→**A Simple Day Structure:**
   270→
   271→- Breakfast: Protein + carbs + fats
   272→- Lunch: Protein + carbs + vegetables
   273→- Pre-workout: Light carbs + protein if needed

   275→- Optional snack: Protein if needed to hit target

   289→3. Set protein at 1g/lb (higher end when cutting)
   290→4. Fill remaining with carbs and fats
   291→
   292→**Maximizing Satiety:**
   293→- High volume, low calorie foods (vegetables, lean proteins)
   294→- More protein = more fullness
   295→- High fiber foods
   296→- Drink water before meals
   297→- Eat slowly

   340→| Standard bulk | +400-500 | Good muscle gain, some fat |
   341→| Dirty bulk | +1000+ | Some muscle, lots of fat |

   343→**Recommendation:**
   344→Lean bulk unless you're very underweight. Gaining fat doesn't build muscle faster, it just means a longer cut later.

   346→**Weight Gain Rate:**
   347→- Beginners: 2-4 lbs/month possible
   348→- Intermediate: 1-2 lbs/month realistic
   349→- Advanced: 0.5-1 lb/month if lucky

   351→**If weight isn't going up:**
   352→You're not eating enough. Track more accurately and add 100-200 calories.

   376→   - Whey, casein, or plant-based
   377→   - Not magic, just food in powder form

   380→   - Most people are deficient
   381→   - 2000-5000 IU daily

   470→**Mistake 1: Not Tracking**
   471→"I eat healthy but can't lose weight."
   472→You're eating more than you think. Track for 2 weeks. I promise.
   473→
   474→**Mistake 2: Drinking Calories**
   475→Soda, juice, alcohol, fancy coffee drinks. 500+ invisible calories daily. Switch to water, black coffee, diet drinks.
   476→
   477→**Mistake 3: Weekend Destruction**
   478→5 days of deficit, 2 days of surplus = maintenance. The weekend counts.
   479→
   480→**Mistake 4: All-or-Nothing**
   481→One bad meal doesn't ruin the week. Just get back on track. Don't spiral into "I already messed up so..."
   482→
   483→**Mistake 5: Avoiding Carbs**
   484→Carbs aren't the enemy. Excess calories are. Low carb works by reducing calories, not magic.
   485→
   486→**Mistake 6: Not Eating Enough Protein**
   487→"I think I get enough." You probably don't. Track it. 0.8-1g/lb is more than most people think.
   488→
   489→**Mistake 7: Relying on Supplements**
   490→No supplement will fix a bad diet. Food first, supplements for gaps.
   491→
   492→**Mistake 8: Overcomplicating**
   493→Meal timing, food combining, "clean eating" obsession. Hit calories and protein. That's 80% of it.`,

   500→
   501→**Week 1: Baseline**
   502→- Download a tracking app (MyFitnessPal, Cronometer)
   503→- Get a food scale
   504→- Track everything you eat for 7 days (no changes)
   505→- See where you actually are
   506→
   507→**Week 2: Adjust**
   508→- Calculate your calorie target based on goal
   509→- Set protein target (0.8-1g/lb)
   510→- Start hitting these targets
   511→
   512→**Week 3-4: Dial In**
   513→- Monitor weight trends
   514→- Adjust calories if needed (not losing? Reduce by 100-200)
   515→- Find meals that work for you
   516→- Build a rotation of go-to meals
   517→
   518→**Ongoing: Optimize**
   519→- Track until you can estimate accurately
   520→- Meal prep to stay consistent
   521→- Weigh weekly, adjust as needed
   522→- Don't overcomplicate
   523→
   524→**The Truth:**
   525→Most of your results come from:
   526→1. Eating in the right calorie range
   527→2. Hitting protein consistently
   528→3. Doing this for months/years
   529→
   530→Everything else is optimization. Master these three first.`,
