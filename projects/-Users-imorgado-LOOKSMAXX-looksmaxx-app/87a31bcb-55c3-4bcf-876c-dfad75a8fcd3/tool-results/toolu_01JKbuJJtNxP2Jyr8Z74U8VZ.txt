Based on my search, I found comprehensive information about neck training exercises for jawline definition. While I didn't find specific infographic visual guides, here's a summary of the most effective exercises from various health sources:

## Key Neck & Jawline Exercises

### 1. Neck Curl-Ups
Neck crunches are like an abdominal crunch or curl. This exercise activates neck muscles that are rarely used.(no content)Lay down on your back and press your tongue to the roof of your mouth. Bring your chin to your chest, lifting your head about 2 to 3 inches off the ground. Slowly lower your head back down and repeat.

### 2. Chin Tucks
Chin tucks activate deep neck flexors, reducing double-chin appearance while supporting jaw definition. The exercise strengthens stabilizers that control forward-head posture.(no content)Stand tall with shoulders relaxed, looking forward. Gently draw your chin straight back toward the spine without tilting the head. Hold for 2–3 seconds and release. Repeat for 12–15 reps.

### 3. Chin-Up Exercise
The chin-up exercise lifts the facial muscles in the lower half of your face, including your jaw. Close your mouth and slowly push your jaw forward. Lift your lower lip and push up until you feel the muscles in your chin and jawline stretch. Stay in this position for about 10 seconds before repeating.

### 4. Collarbone Backup
The collarbone exercise engages the muscles under your chin that support your jaw. Slowly bring your head back several inches until you feel the muscles on the side of your neck contract, keeping your chest as still as possible. Keep your chin parallel to the floor as you move.

### 5. Neck Stretch
The neck stretch is a simple yet effective exercise that can help improve the appearance of your jawline by stretching and toning the neck muscles. Tilt your head back, looking at the ceiling.

## Muscles Targeted
Your jawline and neck can be trained like any other muscle group to create a stronger, more defined look. The masseter, SCM, digastric, mylohyoid, and trapezius muscles contribute to jawline sharpness, thickness, and overall facial structure.

## Benefits & Results
Exercising the neck, chin, jaw, and other facial muscles can lead to subtle changes in your face, including sharper cheekbones and a more prominent jawline. One study found that performing regular facial exercises for 20 weeks led to fuller cheeks and a more youthful appearance.(no content)After 30 days of consistent practice, you may notice noticeable firmness along the neck and jawline, sharper contour, and overall improved support and alignment from shoulders to head.

## Important Tips
One major mistake is overtraining. While you might feel motivated to exercise rigorously every day, your jaw and neck muscles need time to recover like any other muscle group in your body. Excessive strain can result in soreness and fatigue, ultimately hindering your progress.(no content)Dentists recommend spending 20-30 minutes a day on these exercises to see a noticeable difference in your facial appearance. However, if you are a beginner, start these exercises with a limited number of repetitions, as it takes time to build up the muscles.
