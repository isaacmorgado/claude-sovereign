    39→**The Golden Ratio:**
    40→Your shoulder circumference should be roughly 1.618x your waist circumference. This is the mathematical proportion that's been considered ideal since ancient Greece.
    41→
    42→**The Reality:**
    43→Most guys have the opposite—narrow shoulders and wide waists. This is what sitting at a desk 8 hours a day produces.
    44→
    45→**The Fix:**
    46→Build the shoulders and lats wide. Keep the waist narrow. Simple concept, requires consistent work.`,
