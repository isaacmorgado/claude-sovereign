## Overview of Mewing Technique

Mewing is a tongue posture technique that involves placing the tongue flat against the roof of the mouth to improve oral posture, facial appearance, and breathing. Originally developed by British orthodontist Dr. John Mew and later promoted by his son Dr. Mike Mew, mewing has gained viral popularity online as a non-invasive alternative to jaw surgery.

## How to Mew Correctly

According to multiple 2025 guides, here are the key steps:

Place the tip of your tongue just behind your front teeth without touching them. Press the middle and back of your tongue gently against the entire palate. Ensure your whole tongue makes contact with the roof of your mouth.(no content)Your entire tongue—tip, middle, and back—should rest against the roof of your mouth, just behind your front teeth. Make sure your tongue isn't pushing against your teeth. Keep your lips lightly closed without clenching.(no content)Breathe through your nose, not your mouth. Nasal breathing plays a critical role in both oxygen efficiency and overall airway health, complementing the benefits of proper tongue posture.

## "NG" Technique for Beginners

One of the most effective methods to achieve proper tongue placement is the "NG" technique. Ensure your lips are sealed and you breathe through the nose. Articulate the words "king", "sing", and "ring" stressing the NG.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

If your neck is in the wrong position when doing it, it will actually hurt your results. If the back of your neck isn't long and your platysma is tense, you're actually pulling everything down. That can lead to platysma (neck) bands.(no content)Avoid pushing your tongue forward, as this can put pressure on your teeth. Focus on keeping the tongue flat against the palate.

## Important Caveats

Mewing is not a quick fix. Its effects are long-term and require constant application over months or even years.(no content)While proponents claim it can enhance jawline definition, treat sleep apnea, and prevent orthodontic issues, medical experts note that scientific evidence supporting these claims is limited.
