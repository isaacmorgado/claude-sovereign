It is based off of 46 harmony ratios and angles from the front and side profile, accounting to 500 points. The measurements are taken from top male models and actors, highlighting the ideal ranges (Jon Erik Hexum, Sean O'pry, David Gandy, Matt Bomer, etc). The more points a ratio accounts for, the more important it is.\n\n### Key Points About the Formula:\n\nThe entire formula is public and it takes an hour to measure the 46 ratios yourself, calculate your rating, harmony, and dimo.(no content)The criticism of FaceIQLabs is that it overrates extremely hard and points out non-existent \"pros\" and wrong flaws. To get an accurate measurement you have to manually re-adjust the ratios on his website which takes the same effort as doing it yourself. It rates 5.5's as 6.75-7+.\n\n### Important Ratios Mentioned:\n\nFWHR, tFWHR, canthal tilt, ESR, chin to philtrum, bigonial width, and facial thirds are the most integral ratios from what is known.(no content)For the 0.96-1.02 ratio, this is considered perfect for males according to FaceIQ's revised version of CAS harmony calculator, because those ratios aren't too long or too short and feminine.\n\n### Calculating Harmony:\n\nUsing the Percentage Error Formula to Calculate the Closeness to the Ideal Ratio: The percentage error formula represents the difference between an experimental value and a theoretical value. Imagine that Ve = your ratio and Vt = the ideal ratio. After plugging in these values, you must subtract your total from 100 to calculate the closeness of your ratio to the ideal ratio.\n\n### Free Tools Available:\n\nThere is a free unlimited facial ratios calculator available that has been fixed and improved for total harmony calculation mechanism and added new ratios. It works good and is accurate.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4c947628-f168-4584-bf44-d1fc45b128f7","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:16:27.081Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"FaceIQ harmony calculator 46 ratios formula looksmax","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01DJc2gBZz3Mpohm8UZss7Wm","content":[{"title":"Harmony calculator (including ideal ratios + score sheet) | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/harmony-calculator-including-ideal-ratios-score-sheet.1264955/"},{"title":"A 2–10 Looks Scale and a Structured, Unbiased Guide to Facial Analysis (RATE YOURSELF OR OTHERS WITH EASE) | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/a-2-10-looks-scale-and-a-structured-unbiased-guide-to-facial-analysis-rate-yourself-or-others-with-ease.1723949/"},{"title":"A Complete Facial Proportions and Facial Harmony Guide. | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/a-complete-facial-proportions-and-facial-harmony-guide.1599045/"},{"title":"Free Unlimited Full Facial Ratios Calculator: Fixed and improved total Harmony calculation mechanism (more accurate and relevant) + added new ratios. | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/free-unlimited-full-facial-ratios-calculator-fixed-and-improved-total-harmony-calculation-mechanism-more-accurate-and-relevant-added-new-ratios.1583087/"},{"title":"FaceIQ Labs = Biggest Cope | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/faceiq-labs-biggest-cope.1711854/"},{"title":"Looksmax","url":"https://looksmax.gg/threads/how-to-measure-harmony-guide.11628/"},{"title":"Full Measuring Guide | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/full-measuring-guide.1773516/"},{"title":"How can one calculate their facial harmony score? | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/how-can-one-calculate-their-facial-harmony-score.1101679/"},{"title":"FACIAL HARMONY RATIOS (guide) | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/facial-harmony-ratios-guide.1742795/"},{"title":"How can i calculate my facial harmony? | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/how-can-i-calculate-my-facial-harmony.1661635/"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about FaceIQ's harmony calculator and the 46 ratios formula:\n\n## FaceIQ Harmony Calculator - 46 Ratios Formula\n\nThis is a guide to accurately rate someone's facial harmony (without angularity, dimorphism, miscellaneous features).

It rates 5.5's as 6.75-7+.\n\n### Important Ratios Mentioned:\n\nFWHR, tFWHR, canthal tilt, ESR, chin to philtrum, bigonial width, and facial thirds are the most integral ratios from what is known.(no content)For the 0.96-1.02 ratio, this is considered perfect for males according to FaceIQ's revised version of CAS harmony calculator, because those ratios aren't too long or too short and feminine.\n\n### Calculating Harmony:\n\nUsing the Percentage Error Formula to Calculate the Closeness to the Ideal Ratio: The percentage error formula represents the difference between an experimental value and a theoretical value. Imagine that Ve = your ratio and Vt = the ideal ratio. After plugging in these values, you must subtract your total from 100 to calculate the closeness of your ratio to the ideal ratio.\n\n### Free Tools Available:\n\nThere is a free unlimited facial ratios calculator available that has been fixed and improved for total harmony calculation mechanism and added new ratios. It works good and is accurate."],"durationSeconds":20.623606416001916}}

For each face these measures can be used individually or collectively by adding their standardised measures or their Z-scores.(no content)One study calculated five separate masculinity indices using measures related to eye size, ratio of lower face height to total face height, cheek bone prominence, ratio of face width to lower face height, and mean eyebrow height.(no content)Research found that shape features typically perceived as masculine are wide faces with a wide inter-orbital distance, a wide nose, thin lips, and a large and massive lower face.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"71222c9c-7c67-4232-a442-e9f2ff796b10","timestamp":"2025-12-20T04:17:38.783Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"FaceIQ dimorphism score calculation masculine features formula","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01T7p9kWukHQFEFArfu7KjTC","content":[{"title":"A 2–10 Looks Scale and a Structured, Unbiased Guide to Facial Analysis (RATE YOURSELF OR OTHERS WITH EASE) | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/a-2-10-looks-scale-and-a-structured-unbiased-guide-to-facial-analysis-rate-yourself-or-others-with-ease.1723949/"},{"title":"Got my rating from FaceIQ | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/got-my-rating-from-faceiq.1382059/"},{"title":"Calculate sexual dimorphism of faces • facefuns","url":"https://iholzleitner.github.io/facefuns/articles/calcSD.html"},{"title":"FaceIQ Labs — Objective Facial Analysis","url":"https://www.faceiqlabs.com/"},{"title":"The Morphometrics of “Masculinity” in Human Faces - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4324773/"},{"title":"a guide to face ratings cause nobodys getting it right | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/a-guide-to-face-ratings-cause-nobodys-getting-it-right.1761745/"},{"title":"A new data-driven mathematical model dissociates attractiveness from sexual dimorphism of human faces | Scientific Reports","url":"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-020-73472-8"},{"title":"Harmony calculator (including ideal ratios + score sheet) | Looksmax.org - Men's Self-Improvement & Aesthetics","url":"https://looksmax.org/threads/harmony-calculator-including-ideal-ratios-score-sheet.1264955/"},{"title":"FaceIQ Premium Analysis","url":"https://faceiq.gumroad.com/l/full"},{"title":"Geometric Facial Gender Scoring: Objectivity of Perception | PLOS One","url":"https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0099483"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about FaceIQ dimorphism score calculation and masculine features formulas:\n\n## FaceIQ Dimorphism Score Calculation\n\nFaceIQ (a YouTube/online facial analysis service) scores faces using a formula that includes facial harmony, angularity (leanness), dimorphism, and miscellaneous features.(no content)The recommended rating metric uses dimorphism as 20% of the overall face score, along with harmony (40%), features (25%), and angularity (15%).\n\n### DIMO (Dimorphism) Formula\n\nDIMO, with a weight of 20%, describes how masculine a person is, with 0 being the closest to female-ish features, and 100 usually being a manly ogre.

What is my true rating?\"\n- One commenter noted skepticism about the ratings: \"There's no way this guy is that high\"\n- Users have reported technical issues, such as one who said \"it thought my chin was in the air and it gave me a 0/10 for it\"\n\n### FaceIQ Mobile App (Google Play)\nA user review stated: \"While I love watching your videos, and your advice is beyond anything I've seen before, this app isn't the best I'm going to be honest, not because it's unpolished or anything. But when I scanned with free, and scanned with pro nothing changed whatsoever?\"\n\nThe general sentiment from user discussions suggests skepticism about the accuracy of FaceIQ's facial analysis tools, with users questioning whether the scores reflect real-world attractiveness perceptions."],"durationSeconds":18.809603333003817}}

What is \"Harmony Score\"?\n\n**Definition**: Harmony score measures how closely your facial proportions align with idealized facial ratios derived from top male models and actors (Jon Erik Hexum, Sean O'Pry, David Gandy, Matt Bomer). It represents the mathematical balance and proportional relationship between facial features.\n\n**The Core Formula** (from [Looksmax.gg Harmony Guide](https://looksmax.gg/threads/how-to-measure-harmony-guide.11628/)):\n\n```\nHarmony Percentage = ((Your Score - Worst Score) / (Max Score - Worst Score)) x 100\n```\n\nWhere:\n- **Maximum possible score**: 333.71 points\n- **Minimum possible score**: -337.71 points\n\nThis normalizes individual point totals into a 0-100 percentile scale.\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Scoring Structure\n\nAccording to [Looksmax Facial Harmony Ratios Guide](https://looksmax.org/threads/facial-harmony-ratios-guide.1742795/), the system evaluates **46 ratios and angles** totaling **500 points**:\n\n| Profile | Points | Percentage |\n|---------|--------|------------|\n| Front Profile | 307 points | 61% |\n| Side Profile | 193 points | 39% |\n\n---\n\n### 3. Complete List of Ratios and Point Values\n\n#### Front Profile Metrics (307 points total):\n\n| Ratio | Ideal Range | Points |\n|-------|-------------|--------|\n| Eye separation (IPD) | 44.3-47.4% | +35 |\n| Facial thirds (upper third 33%) | 29.5-36.5% | +30 |\n| Canthal tilt | 5-7 degrees | +30 |\n| FWHR | 1.9-2.06 | +25 |\n| Cheekbone high setedness | 81-100% | +25 |\n| Jaw frontal angle | 82-94 degrees | +25 |\n| Total FWHR (tFWHR) | 1.33-1.38 | +19.5 |\n| Bigonial width to cheekbone width | 85.5-92% | +15 |\n| Total face height/width ratio | 1.3-1.4 | +15 |\n| Chin to philtrum ratio | 2.05-2.55 | +12.5 |\n| Mouth width to nose width | 1.38-1.53 | +10 |\n| Midface ratio | 0.93-1.01 | +10 |\n| Eye spacing | 0.93-1.04 | +10 |\n| Eye aspect ratio (WHR) | 2.8-3.6 | +10 |\n| Eyebrow low-setedness | <0.5 | +10 |\n| Lower lip to upper lip ratio | 1.4-2 (or 0.33-0.4 height) | +7.5 |\n| Orbital vector | Positive | +7.5 |\n| Nasal height to width ratio | 0.62-0.88 | +5 |\n| Bitemporal width | 84-95% | +5 |\n| Lower third face proportions | 30.6-34% | +5 |\n| Eyebrow tilt | 5-13 degrees | +5 |\n| Ipsilateral alar angle | 84-95 degrees | +2.5 |\n\n#### Side Profile Metrics (193 points total):\n\n| Ratio | Ideal Range | Points |\n|-------|-------------|--------|\n| Gonial angle | 112-125 degrees | +40 |\n| Total facial convexity angle | 137.5-148.5 degrees | +15 |\n| Nasofrontal angle | 106-130 degrees | +15 |\n| Facial convexity angle | 168-176 degrees | +12.5 |\n| Mandibular plane angle | 15-24 degrees | +12.5 |\n| Ramus to mandible ratio | 0.59-0.78 | +10 |\n| Nasolabial angle | 90-98.5 degrees (men) | +7.5 |\n| Submental cervical angle | 91-110 degrees | +7.5 |\n| Nasofacial angle | 30-36 degrees | +7.5 |\n| Mentolabial angle | 108-130 degrees | +5 |\n| Nasal projection | 0.55-0.68 | +5 |\n| Nasomental angle | 125-132 degrees | +5 |\n| Nasal tip angle | 112-125 degrees | +5 |\n| Brow ridge inclination | 13-24 degrees | +5 |\n\n---\n\n### 4. The 38 Most Important Ratios (Color-Coded by Importance)\n\nFrom [Looksmax 38 Ratios Guide](https://looksmax.org/threads/38-most-important-facial-ratios-and-the-ideal-measurements-high-effort.956143/):\n\n**RED - Extremely Important:**\n1. Gonial angle: 112-123 degrees\n2. Facial thirds: 29.5-36.5%\n3. Eye separation ratio: 44.3-47.4%\n4. Total facial convexity: 137.5-148.5 degrees\n5. Facial convexity angle: 168-176 degrees\n6. Cheekbone position: 81-100%\n7. Jaw frontal angle: 84.5-95 degrees\n8. Mandibular plane angle: 15-22 degrees\n9. Canthal tilt: 5.2-8.5 degrees\n10. Ramus to mandible ratio: 0.59-0.78\n11. FWHR: 1.9-2.06\n12. Total FWHR: 1.33-1.38\n\n**BLUE - Really Important:**\n13-23 include midface ratio, lip ratios, nasofrontal angle, chin to philtrum, etc.\n\n**GREEN - Important:**\n24-34 include nasal projection, eye aspect ratio, bigonial width, etc.\n\n**WHITE - Less Important:**\n35-38 include recession metrics, eyebrow tilt, medial canthal angle\n\n---\n\n### 5. FaceIQ Labs Overall Rating Formula\n\nFrom [Looksmax 2-10 Scale Guide](https://looksmax.org/threads/a-2-10-looks-scale-and-a-structured-unbiased-guide-to-facial-analysis-rate-yourself-or-others-with-ease.1723949/), FaceIQ uses four weighted components:\n\n| Component | Weight | Description |\n|-----------|--------|-------------|\n| **HARM (Harmony)** | 32% | Feature proportions and balance |\n| **MISC (Miscellaneous)** | 26% | Skin, eyes, coloring, nose, lips, jawline |\n| **ANGU (Angularity)** | 22% | Facial definition and sharpness |\n| **DIMO (Dimorphism)** | 20% | Masculine characteristics |\n\n**Final Rating Calculation (3 steps)**:\n1. **Weighted Average**: Multiply each component's score (0-10) by its weight\n2. **Spread Analysis**: Calculate difference between highest and lowest component scores\n3. **Penalty Application**: Subtract (spread x 0.5) from weighted average\n\nExample: A person scoring 6.5 (Harmony), 7.9 (Dimorphism), 4.0 (Angularity), 6.9 (Misc) would receive approximately 4.4/10 after imbalance penalty.\n\n---\n\n### 6. How Individual Ratios Are Scored\n\nFrom [Looksmax Harmony Calculator Thread](https://looksmax.org/threads/harmony-calculator-including-ideal-ratios-score-sheet.1264955/):\n\n**Percentage Error Method**:\n```\nCloseness to Ideal = 100 - |((Your Ratio - Ideal Ratio) / Ideal Ratio) x 100|\n```\n\n**Tiered Deduction System** (from [Why Harmony Formula is Wrong](https://looksmax.org/threads/why-the-harmony-formula-is-completely-wrong.1576571/)):\n- If you fall outside the ideal range, each subsequent tier deducts **half the points**\n- Example: IPD is worth 35 points. If 44.2% (just outside 44.3-47.4%), you lose 17.5 points\n\n---\n\n### 7. What Makes a \"High\" vs \"Low\" Harmony Score\n\nFrom research across multiple sources:\n\n| Score Range | Classification | Description |\n|-------------|---------------|-------------|\n| 85%+ | Exceptional | Top-tier model level |\n| 80-85% | Excellent | \"Chad\" territory - virtually every attractive person |\n| 70-79.9% | Good | High-Tier Normie (HTN) - roughly 6/10 |\n| 65-79.9% | Average | Mid-Tier Normie (MTN) |\n| 50-65% | Below Average | Noticeable imbalances |\n| <50% | Poor | Significant disharmony |\n\n**FaceIQ Labs Statistical Framework** (from [True Harmony AI](https://trueharmony.ai/)):\n- Uses normal distribution with **mean of 50%** and **standard deviation of 12.5%**\n- 75% harmony = 2 standard deviations above mean = top 2.5% (1 in 40)\n\n---\n\n### 8. Criticisms of the Methodology\n\nFrom [FaceIQ Labs = Biggest Cope](https://looksmax.org/threads/faceiq-labs-biggest-cope.1711854/) and [Why Harmony Formula is Wrong](https://looksmax.org/threads/why-the-harmony-formula-is-completely-wrong.1576571/):\n\n1. **Overrating**: \"Rates 5.5's as 6.75-7+\" - consistently inflates scores\n2. **AI Accuracy**: Estimated only 65% accuracy for automated landmark detection\n3. **Binary Deductions**: Losing half points for being 0.1% outside ideal range is too harsh\n4. **Gender Blindness**: Same standards for men/women ignores natural dimorphism\n5. **Manual Adjustment Required**: Users must \"re-adjust the ratios manually\" for accuracy\n6. **Inconsistent Celebrity Ratings**: Allegedly gave Timothee Chalamet 4.5/10 harmony\n\n---\n\n### 9. About FaceIQ (The Creator)\n\nFrom [GirlsAskGuys](https://www.girlsaskguys.com/fashion-style/q5388145-what-do-you-think-about-faceiq) and [Skool Profile](https://www.skool.com/@face-iq-3583):\n\n- FaceIQ is a YouTube channel about facial beauty and celebrity analysis\n- Borrows methodology from former channel \"Creating Attractive\" (now defunct)\n- Same creator runs FaceIQ Labs (faceiqlabs.com), the paid analysis service\n- Also offers \"Looksmaxxing School\" community\n- Creates celebrity facial analysis videos with ratings\n\n---\n\n### 10.
