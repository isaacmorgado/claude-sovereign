Supplement Guide Missing Product Images ✅\n**Root Cause:** Product IDs in guides didn't match the registry (e.g., `'ashwagandha'` vs `'ashwagandha_ksm66'`)\n\n**Fix:**\n- Added product ID aliases in `products-registry.ts` to map shorthand names to full IDs\n- Added missing products: `l_theanine`, `protein_powder`\n\n### 2. Focus Rituals Empty Products Section ✅\n**Root Cause:** The guide referenced `l_theanine` which didn't exist in the registry\n\n**Fix:**\n- Added L-Theanine product with proper image, pricing, and affiliate links\n- Product callouts will now render correctly\n\n### 3. Scroll Flickering Bug ✅\n**Root Cause:** Framer Motion's `whileHover` was triggering during touch scroll events\n\n**Fix:**\n- Replaced `whileHover={{ y: -2 }}` with CSS `hover:-translate-y-0.5`\n- Removed unnecessary entrance animation from GuideStatsCard\n- CSS hover is more precise and doesn't trigger on touch scrolling\n\nLet me check the background build status:"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":9,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3276,"cache_read_input_tokens":45566,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3276,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWXDRNFG4hYfbfChJ3y7q","type":"assistant","uuid":"cb51dd06-b996-4865-a0b4-5da9d052dc31","timestamp":"2025-12-27T12:46:09.885Z"}

It's premium/optional, so understandable. However, concentration of all hair products into single `hair-loss.ts` guide creates imbalance—they should be distributed across male/female-specific hair guides.\n\n### BEARD (5 products) - 100% Usage\n\n| Product | Used | References |\n|---------|------|-----------|\n| beard_dermaroller | YES | beard-growth (1) |\n| beard_oil_honest | YES | beard-growth (1) |\n| beard_balm | YES | beard-growth (1) |\n| beard_trimmer_philips | YES | beard-growth (1) |\n| jawline_exerciser_pro | YES | beard-growth (1) |\n\n**Strong coverage:** All beard products concentrated in single guide.

melatonin in sleep guides; vitamin C in skincare + anti-aging\n- **Recommendation:** Create cross-reference in sleep guides and anti-aging protocols\n\n### Well-Represented Categories\n\n**K-Beauty:** 100% usage (all 8 products in glass-skin.ts)\n**Beard:** 100% usage (all 5 in beard-growth.ts)\n**Surgery Recovery:** 100% usage (all 3 across surgical guides)\n**Teeth:** 100% usage (all 6 in teeth-smile.ts)\n**Hormonal/PCOS:** 100% usage (all 5 distributed across hormonal/female guides)\n\n---\n\n## GUIDE ANALYSIS: PRODUCT INTEGRATION GAPS\n\n### Guides with NO Products (11 guides, 17%)\n\nThese guides could benefit from product recommendations:\n\n| Guide | Category | Opportunity |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| mindset.ts | Fundamentals | Motivation/psychology - no product fit |\n| blood-markers.ts | Health | Testing service recommendation |\n| hormone-panels.ts | Health | Testing service recommendation |\n| metabolic-markers.ts | Health | Testing service recommendation |\n| cardiovascular-markers.ts | Health | Testing service recommendation |\n| sleep-apnea.ts | Sleep | CPAP recommendation (not in registry) |\n| cutting-guide.ts | Nutrition | food_scale (should be added) |\n| carb-timing.ts | Nutrition | Neutral, no products needed |\n| toxic-swaps.ts | Lifestyle | Environmental products not in registry |\n| toxins-aesthetics.ts | Lifestyle | Environmental products not in registry |\n| environmental-engineering.ts | Lifestyle | Environmental products not in registry |\n\n**Finding:** Several lifestyle/environmental guides lack products because the registry doesn't include water filters, air purifiers, or cleaning products—these should be added as new product categories.\n\n### Guides with 6+ Products (High Density)\n\n| Guide | Product Count | Products |\n|-------|---------------|----------|\n| glass-skin.ts | 9 | All K-beauty products |\n| teeth-smile.ts | 7 | All teeth products + copper_tongue_scraper |\n| maintenance.ts | 7 | Grooming + hygiene essentials |\n| diet.ts | 6 | Scales, creatine, omega-3, collagen, D3, mag |\n| hair-loss.ts | 8 | All hair products except laser cap |\n| beard-growth.ts | 7 | Beard products + jawline exerciser |\n| anti-aging-women.ts | 8 | Skincare + supplements + sunscreen |\n| hormonal-skin.ts | 6 | PCOS-specific treatments |\n\n**Finding:** High product density in category-specific guides (hair, teeth, beard, K-beauty) makes sense. However, cross-category guides (diet.ts, anti-aging-women.ts) have good distribution.\n\n---\n\n## PRODUCTCALLOUT COMPONENT VERIFICATION\n\nExamined `/src/components/results/tabs/GuidesTab.tsx` (lines 175-237):\n\n```typescript\nfunction ProductCallout({ productId }: ProductCalloutProps) {\n  const product = getGuideProductById(productId);  // ← Resolves product by ID\n  const link = getLink(product.regionLinks, product.directLink);  // ← Gets region-aware link\n  // Renders product image, name, brand, tagline, and \"BUY\" CTA\n}\n```\n\n**Status:** ✅ ProductCallout properly resolves all product IDs using `getGuideProductById()` and generates region-aware affiliate links via `useRegion()`.\n\n**Verification of getGuideProductById()** (lines 1319-1323):\n```typescript\nexport function getGuideProductById(id: string): GuideProduct | undefined {\n  const resolvedId = PRODUCT_ID_ALIASES[id] || id;\n  return GUIDE_PRODUCTS.find(p => p.id === resolvedId);\n}\n```\n\n**Status:** ✅ Function properly resolves aliases and searches by exact ID match.
