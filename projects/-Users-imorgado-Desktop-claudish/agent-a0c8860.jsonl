Let me think through the steps.\n\nFirst, I'll start by exploring the codebase to understand the current structure. I'll use Glob to find key files related to the feature. Maybe something like `Glob \"**/*.ts\"` to list all TypeScript files.\n\nNext, I'll use Grep to search for relevant patterns. For example, if the feature involves handlers, I might search for `handler` in all files.\n\nThen, I'll read critical files to get a deeper understanding. Using the Read tool on files like `src/handlers/shared/tool-call-recovery.ts` will help me see how similar features are implemented.\n\nI'll also check the git history to see how similar changes were made. Using `git log` with Grep could show past implementations.\n\nAfter gathering all this info, I'll outline the implementation steps. Maybe adding a new handler, updating interfaces, or modifying core logic.\n\nFinally, I'll list the critical files that will be affected, like `src/handlers/feature.ts` or `src/core/logic.ts`, explaining why each is important.\n\nThis structured approach ensures I cover all bases before diving into the code.\n</think>\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\n- src/handlers/shared/tool-call-recovery.ts - [Core logic to modify]\n- src/providers/remote-provider-registry.ts - [Interfaces to implement]\n- src/proxy-server.ts - [Pattern to follow]"}],"model":"featherless/huihui-ai/DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B-abliterated","stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":100,"output_tokens":298}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"2f400cc5-eb84-469a-8d0c-64bcebdf69b0","timestamp":"2026-01-07T21:37:10.574Z"}
