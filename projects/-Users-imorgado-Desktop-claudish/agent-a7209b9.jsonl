Let's get started with the warm-up. To ensure we're on the same page, I'll briefly outline the steps we'll take to understand the requirements, explore the codebase, and design our solution.\n\n### Step 1: Understand Requirements\nWe need to clarify the specific requirements and goals for the implementation plan. Since we don't have explicit requirements yet, let's assume we need to enhance the local model support feature in Claudish.\n\n### Step 2: Explore Thoroughly\nWe'll use Bash commands to explore the codebase and identify key files and patterns. We'll focus on the following files and directories:\n\n- `/Users/imorgado/Desktop/claudish/src/handlers/shared/tool-call-recovery.ts`\n- `/Users/imorgado/Desktop/claudish/src/providers/remote-provider-registry.ts`\n- `/Users/imorgado/Desktop/claudish/src/proxy-server.ts`\n- `/Users/imorgado/Desktop/claudish/src/types.ts`\n- `/Users/imorgado/Desktop/claudish/src/handlers/featherless-handler.ts`\n- `/Users/imorgado/Desktop/claudish/src/handlers/shared/featherless-tool-formats.ts`\n\nLet's start by examining the `src/handlers/shared/tool-call-recovery.ts` file to understand its role in the current architecture.\n\n```bash\ncat /Users/imorgado/Desktop/claudish/src/handlers/shared/tool-call-recovery.ts\n```\n\n### Step 3: Design Solution\nBased on the exploration, we'll design an implementation plan that enhances local model support while adhering to existing patterns and conventions.\n\n### Step 4: Detail the Plan\nWe'll provide a detailed step-by-step implementation strategy, identifying dependencies and potential challenges.\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\nList 3-5 files most critical for implementing this plan:\n\n- `/Users/imorgado/Desktop/claudish/src/handlers/shared/tool-call-recovery.ts` - [Brief reason: Core logic to modify]\n- `/Users/imorgado/Desktop/claudish/src/providers/remote-provider-registry.ts` - [Brief reason: Interfaces to implement]\n- `/Users/imorgado/Desktop/claudish/src/proxy-server.ts` - [Brief reason: Pattern to follow]\n\nPlease provide more specific requirements or perspectives if needed, and we can proceed further."}],"model":"featherless/huihui-ai/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-abliterated","stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":100,"output_tokens":475}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"f0de3b5d-6ac6-4aba-8c53-e6072317b6d4","timestamp":"2026-01-08T01:02:53.010Z"}
