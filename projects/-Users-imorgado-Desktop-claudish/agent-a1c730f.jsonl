Let's get started with understanding the requirements and exploring the codebase for designing the implementation plan for Claude Code. Since no specific requirements or perspectives were provided yet, I'll wait for your detailed instructions on what needs to be accomplished.\n\nFeel free to provide me with the requirements and any additional perspectives you'd like me to consider. Once I have those details, I'll proceed with exploring the codebase, identifying patterns, and designing the solution accordingly.\n\nLooking forward to your guidance!"}],"model":"featherless/huihui-ai/Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct-abliterated","stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":100,"output_tokens":97}},"type":"assistant","uuid":"53e3da70-73c3-4144-bfc3-55afc4a1fb8e","timestamp":"2026-01-07T23:24:37.908Z"}
