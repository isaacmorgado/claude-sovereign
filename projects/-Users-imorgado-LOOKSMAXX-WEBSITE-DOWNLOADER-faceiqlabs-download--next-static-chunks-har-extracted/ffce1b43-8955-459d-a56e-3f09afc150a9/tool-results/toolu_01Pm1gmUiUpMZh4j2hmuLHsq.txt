## Key Observations

**No explicit facial analysis code detected**: The page content does not reveal specific bundles containing FaceLandmarker, MediaPipe, or facial computation logic. These libraries may be:
- Loaded dynamically after authentication
- Contained within the numbered chunk files without clear naming
- Fetched from separate endpoints after login

**No visible API endpoints**: The HTML source doesn't expose REST endpoints for facial analysis requests.

**Authentication required**: The platform uses Google OAuth, suggesting facial analysis features load post-login, which would explain why examination of the public sign-in page reveals minimal technical details about the actual analysis infrastructure.
