I'm Claude Code, Anthropic's CLI file search specialist. I have access to the LOOKSMAXX codebase located at `/Users/imorgado/LOOKSMAXX`.\n\nI understand the key constraints:\n- **READ-ONLY mode**: I can only search and analyze files, not create, modify, or delete them\n- **Efficient searching**: I'll use Glob for pattern matching, Grep for content search, and Read for specific files\n- **Fast execution**: I'll spawn parallel tool calls where possible\n- **Absolute paths**: All paths in my responses will be absolute\n\nI've reviewed the project instructions in CLAUDE.md. This is a comprehensive facial metrics analysis system with:\n- Next.js 14 frontend with TypeScript\n- FastAPI backend on Railway\n- MediaPipe + InsightFace face detection\n- 70+ metrics, 118 treatments, and extensive FaceIQ feature parity\n\nI'm ready for your search request.
