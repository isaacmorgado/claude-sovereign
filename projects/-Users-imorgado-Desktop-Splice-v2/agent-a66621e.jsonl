UXP is the next generation of APIs, for Premiere v25.6 and beyond.(no content)UXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment, and you just need to require() the appropriate modules to access the APIs you need.\n\n### Network Requests and Permissions\n\nUXP provides practical examples for common tasks like filesystem operations, network requests, and styling.(no content)UXP offers file system, networking, shell execution, and core UXP functionality.(no content)Permission-based APIs need to be allow-listed in your plugin's manifest.json. For example, to use the file system or make network requests, you must declare the appropriate permissions.\n\n### External HTTP Communication Options\n\n**PremiereRemote (CEP-based):**\nThere are two ways to trigger PremiereRemote functionality from outside: Using HTTP requests or using WebSocket calls.(no content)Using the CEP extension mechanism, PremiereRemote provides a framework to trigger your own Premiere functionality from outside of Premiere, e.g., by using AutoHotkey. This is achieved by starting a local server inside of Premiere, allowing to trigger custom functionality using a local http request or with websockets.\n\n**Pymiere (Python Integration):**\nPymiere sends the ExtendScript code to the Pymiere Link extension via the requests library using HTTP. The Pymiere Link extension is essentially a node.js server which receives the ExtendScript code and executes it within Premiere Pro. Where required, Pymiere Link will return data as a JSON encoded response back to Pymiere.\n\n### Legacy ExtendScript Support\n\nPremiere Pro's ExtendScript-based API allows for broad control of the entire application.

One recommended way to structure the folders would be: /CSXS -- contains the manifest.xml file, which stores the extension configuration data. As noted above, this is a requirement for your extension to show up in the host app.\n\n### Key manifest.xml Elements\nFor a minimal setup, the key XML elements include: ExtensionBundleId (a unique bundle ID like com.my.test), Extension Id (a unique ID following syntax like ExtensionBundleID + .panel), and Host Name & Version (list of host application IDs and versions that your extension supports).\n\n### Extension Types\nThese extension types are supported by CEP. You need to specify an extension's type in its manifest.xml.\n\n- The Panel type behaves like any other application panel. It can be docked, participates in workspaces, has fly-out menus, and is re-opened at start-up if open at shutdown.\n- A Modal Dialog type opens a new extension window and forces the user to interact only with the extension window before returning control to the host application. User can interact with host application only after closing extension window.\n- A Modeless Dialog type opens a new extension window but doesn't force the user to interact with the extension window.\n\n### Modifying Host Application Versions\nAlthough these extensions are initially setup for a particular version of CEP, you can adjust the product version targeted by modifying the range inside the HostList element of the CSXS/manifest.xml file.\n\n### Important Configuration Notes\nEven if you are making an invisible extension (like a server or background process), you still need to provide a geometry and size attribute in your manifest. Your extension will not load if it doesn't have a size attribute, even if it is not rendering anything.(no content)If you want your extension to open its window when the host app launches, include the `<AutoVisible>true</AutoVisible>` setting in your manifest.\n\n### Debugging Unsigned Extensions\nSince Premiere only accepts signed extension, you should tell it to accept unsigned extensions.

As noted above, this is a requirement for your extension to show up in the host app.\n\n### Key manifest.xml Elements\nFor a minimal setup, the key XML elements include: ExtensionBundleId (a unique bundle ID like com.my.test), Extension Id (a unique ID following syntax like ExtensionBundleID + .panel), and Host Name & Version (list of host application IDs and versions that your extension supports).\n\n### Extension Types\nThese extension types are supported by CEP. You need to specify an extension's type in its manifest.xml.\n\n- The Panel type behaves like any other application panel. It can be docked, participates in workspaces, has fly-out menus, and is re-opened at start-up if open at shutdown.\n- A Modal Dialog type opens a new extension window and forces the user to interact only with the extension window before returning control to the host application. User can interact with host application only after closing extension window.\n- A Modeless Dialog type opens a new extension window but doesn't force the user to interact with the extension window.\n\n### Modifying Host Application Versions\nAlthough these extensions are initially setup for a particular version of CEP, you can adjust the product version targeted by modifying the range inside the HostList element of the CSXS/manifest.xml file.\n\n### Important Configuration Notes\nEven if you are making an invisible extension (like a server or background process), you still need to provide a geometry and size attribute in your manifest. Your extension will not load if it doesn't have a size attribute, even if it is not rendering anything.(no content)If you want your extension to open its window when the host app launches, include the `<AutoVisible>true</AutoVisible>` setting in your manifest.\n\n### Debugging Unsigned Extensions\nSince Premiere only accepts signed extension, you should tell it to accept unsigned extensions. You might need to potentially cover 5 to 8 depending on which CSXS version you have, using commands like `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.8 PlayerDebugMode 1`.(no content)If you are in the midst of development and want to bypass the need to sign your extensions, you can bypass the check for extension signatures by editing the CSXS preference properties file, located at: Win: regedit > HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Adobe/CSXS.12, then add a new entry.\n\n### Resources\nThe official documentation and samples are available in the Adobe-CEP GitHub repositories:\n- [Adobe-CEP/Samples](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples) - Code samples including PProPanel for Premiere Pro\n- [Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides) - Getting started guides\n- [Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources) - Documentation including CEP 12 HTML Extension Cookbook"],"durationSeconds":23.665027417000033}}

Each UXP plugin must have one manifest.json file that the host application uses to load and manage the plugin.(no content)In addition to core metadata such as the plugin's name, version, icons, and entry points, the manifest specifies permissions, compatibility details, and other definitions that shape how the plugin integrates with the host environment. Most importantly, it contains your plugin ID, which uniquely identifies your plugin when it's installed in the host application.\n\n### Manifest Version\n\nThe manifest schema version indicates the version of the manifest schema. Premiere supports version \"5\".\n\n### Key Manifest Properties\n\n- **Plugin ID**: Uniquely identifies a plugin and is used to disambiguate plugin contexts, storage, errors, etc. For plugins distributed through the plugin marketplace, the id has to match the one set in the Developer Distribution portal.\n\n- **Entry Points**: The array defines the entrypoints that the plugin provides; currently, only Commands and Panels are supported.\n\n- **Main File**: The primary JavaScript or HTML file is relative to the plugin's installation directory. It supports HTML and JS files, such as index.html and index.js. If not specified, main.js is used.\n\n- **Icons**: An array of icons representing the overall plugin or panel icon. The host application uses these icons to present the plugin to the user. If the icons array is missing, a default icon will be used.\n\n### Icon Specifications\n\nIcon definitions include the width and height of the icon in pixels, and the path to the icon, relative to the plugin's installation directory. Supports PNG (.png), JPG (.jpg or .jpeg), and SVG (.svg) files. You can also specify the scaling factors that the icon supports.\n\n### Permissions\n\nTo ensure that plugins are secure, UXP requires that plugins declare the permissions they need to function. Permissions not explicitly declared will be denied by default.\n\n### Development Requirements\n\nTo develop UXP plugins, you need Premiere (v25.6) or later and UXP Developer Tool (v2.2) or later.(no content)Premiere's Developer Mode should be enabled. Open the Settings menu, select the Plugins tab and select the Enable developer mode checkbox. You will need to restart Premiere for the changes to take effect.\n\n### Plugin Folder Structure\n\nThe UXP Developer Tool will create a new folder with the name you specified in the location you specified. The folder will contain the plugin files including the manifest.json, index.html, and other necessary files.\n\n### Reloading Changes\n\nIf you make any changes to the manifest.json file, you must manually unload and reload the plugin. In the UXP Developer Tool, in the row for your plugin, click Unload and then Load & Watch once more.\n\n### Hybrid Plugins\n\nAddon definitions exist for hybrid plugins. A UXP Hybrid plugin is a UXP plugin that can access the power of C++ native libraries. However, Premiere doesn't support hybrid plugins yet.\n\n### Current Status (2025)\n\nAs of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins.

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level. With UXP, you can build unique tools that integrate with and optimize the most precise, demanding workflows. These tools reduce repetition, maximize efficiency, and transform Premiere into a bespoke application tailored to the needs of any project.(no content)UXP is the current extensibility standard for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, supported by a constantly growing set of applications, including Premiere (version 25.6), Photoshop, and InDesign.\n\n## Current Status\n\nUXP (Unified Extensibility Platform) is now available for development in Premiere Pro Beta. This marks a significant milestone in Adobe's journey to modernize and enhance the extensibility framework for third-party developers.(no content)As of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins. The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/. You need a Premiere Pro BETA build, available through Creative Cloud Desktop.\n\n## React Development with UXP\n\nThere's a lot of config required to get React working in UXP. Bolt UXP makes this easy and is free & open source.(no content)Developers have reported getting React apps working with React version 16, with questions about whether newer React versions like 18 will be supported.\n\n### Bolt UXP - A Key Tool for React Development\n\nBolt UXP is a lightning-fast boilerplate for building Adobe UXP Plugins in Svelte, React, or Vue built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass.(no content)Bolt UXP is 100% free and open source, being released under the MIT license with no attribution required. This means you are free to use it in your free or commercial projects.(no content)There's also a Webview UI option available. If you are new to UXP, it's recommended to leave the Webview option disabled as it adds to the complexity of your project. Enabling the Webview UI option allows you to build your User Interface with full CSS/HTML/JS DOM support following Edge on Windows and Safari on MacOS.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo build your first UXP plugin, you will learn to scaffold one from an existing template, customize it, and run it in Premiere. You need Premiere (v25.6) or later and UXP Developer Tool (v2.2) or later.(no content)Premiere's Developer Mode should be enabled.

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level. With UXP, you can build unique tools that integrate with and optimize the most precise, demanding workflows. These tools reduce repetition, maximize efficiency, and transform Premiere into a bespoke application tailored to the needs of any project.(no content)UXP is the current extensibility standard for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, supported by a constantly growing set of applications, including Premiere (version 25.6), Photoshop, and InDesign.\n\n## Current Status\n\nUXP (Unified Extensibility Platform) is now available for development in Premiere Pro Beta. This marks a significant milestone in Adobe's journey to modernize and enhance the extensibility framework for third-party developers.(no content)As of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins. The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/. You need a Premiere Pro BETA build, available through Creative Cloud Desktop.\n\n## React Development with UXP\n\nThere's a lot of config required to get React working in UXP. Bolt UXP makes this easy and is free & open source.(no content)Developers have reported getting React apps working with React version 16, with questions about whether newer React versions like 18 will be supported.\n\n### Bolt UXP - A Key Tool for React Development\n\nBolt UXP is a lightning-fast boilerplate for building Adobe UXP Plugins in Svelte, React, or Vue built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass.(no content)Bolt UXP is 100% free and open source, being released under the MIT license with no attribution required. This means you are free to use it in your free or commercial projects.(no content)There's also a Webview UI option available. If you are new to UXP, it's recommended to leave the Webview option disabled as it adds to the complexity of your project. Enabling the Webview UI option allows you to build your User Interface with full CSS/HTML/JS DOM support following Edge on Windows and Safari on MacOS.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nTo build your first UXP plugin, you will learn to scaffold one from an existing template, customize it, and run it in Premiere. You need Premiere (v25.6) or later and UXP Developer Tool (v2.2) or later.(no content)Premiere's Developer Mode should be enabled. Open the Settings menu, select the Plugins tab and select the Enable developer mode checkbox. You will need to restart Premiere for the changes to take effect.(no content)When building UXP plugins for Premiere, you don't need to start from scratch. Adobe provides Samples (complete, working examples that demonstrate specific features or use cases) and Starters (minimal templates with framework setup to help you begin a new plugin project).\n\n## Key Resources\n\n- **Official Documentation**: [developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- **Bolt UXP (React/Vue/Svelte boilerplate)**: [github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp)\n- **Sample Code Repository**: [github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)"],"durationSeconds":26.791262000000103}}

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.\n\n### Accessing the Premiere DOM\n\nThe following line allows you access to the Premiere DOM via UXP. From here, you can open documents, modify them, run menu items, and more.(no content)An important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread.\n\n### Available APIs for Clip/Sequence Manipulation\n\nThese APIs let you, among other things, to: Access and modify projects — sequences, tracks, clips, and markers; Work with media — import files, manage project items; Control playback — set in/out points, control the playhead.\n\n### TrackItem Object\n\nThe TrackItem object represents an item on a video or audio track, within a Sequence object.\n\nKey properties include:\n- The duration of the trackItem. Time object, read-only.\n- The visible end time of the trackItem in the sequence, relative to the beginning of its corresponding sequence (NOT the sequence zero point). This may differ from the trackItem's out point, which is relative to the source. Time object, read/write.\n- The visible start time of the trackItem in the sequence, relative to the beginning of its corresponding sequence (NOT the sequence zero point). This may differ from the trackItem's in point, which is relative to the source. Time object, read/write.\n\n### VideoClipTrackItem Class\n\nCreate add transition action for sequence. Returns an action that moves the inPoint of the track item to a new time, by shifting it by a number of seconds.\n\n### Sequence Class\n\nThe Sequence class includes TrackItemSelection which returns the current selection group of the sequence. It also provides methods to get video/audio time display format, sequence settings, time base, video track from track index, and video track count.\n\n### Version Information\n\nPremiere version (v25.6) determines which Premiere DOM APIs are available. UXP version (v8.1) determines which UXP Core APIs are available. Each Premiere release integrates a specific UXP version. For example, Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.\n\n### Moving Clips Between Tracks - Limitations\n\nThere is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks.(no content)The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin, the right starting point for any future integrations, shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Official Documentation**: The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n- **Sample Plugins**: Available on GitHub at AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples\n- **Developer Forums**: For UXP-related discussions, the UXP forum is available at https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/c/uxp-for-premiere-pro/105\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ff6efc8f-ed38-49e7-9651-735ec7ec0a2c","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:16:49.888Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe Premiere Pro UXP API trackItem sequence clip manipulation 2025 documentation","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Gw9C4prfvhjykWk5nugGEb","content":[{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Request for Timeline Editing API Support (Clip Tra... - Adobe Product Community - 15624626","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"VideoClipTrackItem","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/videocliptrackitem/"},{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"Sequence","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/sequence/"},{"title":"Update of UXP APIs inside of Premiere Pro - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/update-of-uxp-apis-inside-of-premiere-pro/10384"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"How to Add Clips to a Sequence Using Premiere Pro UXP API? - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/how-to-add-clips-to-a-sequence-using-premiere-pro-uxp-api/8977"}]},"Based on my search, here's the relevant information about Adobe Premiere Pro UXP API for trackItem, sequence, and clip manipulation in 2025:\n\n## Overview\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).(no content)ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.\n\n## UXP API Documentation\n\nUXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications.

You can also allow access to all domains by setting domains to \"all\".\n\n### Using the Fetch API\n\nIn order to leverage `fetch`, update the `manifest.json` with the `network.domains` permission. From UXP v7.4.0 onwards `permissions.network.domains` does not support WildCards in top-level domains.(no content)Network APIs are accessed just as in a browser, via the global classes XMLHttpRequest and WebSocket, and the global function fetch(). These are similar to the web standard XHR, fetch, and WebSocket found in browsers.\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\n**Manifest Version Matters:**\nAfter testing with manifest v5, some developers found fetch is no longer working (it was working correctly with version 4). The error message states: \"Plugin is not permitted to access the network apis. A valid domains entry is required in requiredPermissions.network field of the manifest.\"\n\n**IP Addresses vs Domain Names:**\nWhen trying to connect to internal servers, using the domain name instead of the IP address resolves the issue. IP addresses are not allowed with the UXP data transfers.\n\n**requiredPermissions vs permissions:**\nrequiredPermissions needs domains under network. Sites works under permissions but UXP wants a requiredPermissions and not a permissions.\n\n### Permission-Based APIs\n\nPermission-based APIs need to be allow-listed in your plugin's manifest.json. For example, to use the file system or make network requests, you must declare the appropriate permissions.\n\n### User Consent Considerations\n\nMake sure you configure the most accurate permission for your use case because in the future Adobe will ask users to provide their consent based on it. For example, for file operations, you may find 'fullAccess' to be the least restrictive and hence the easiest to pick, but a user may not be comfortable giving full access to their system unless it's absolutely necessary and might deny the installation of your plugin altogether.\n\n### HTTPS Requirement\n\nThere are two things that caught developers by surprise in the fetch API: only HTTPS is supported (which is unfortunate for any localhost usage), and the request is cached.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4718cb85-acbe-42f2-a84e-5bef1ccb76c0","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:17:21.283Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP plugin network permissions fetch API external backend communication","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01DQyypTGrtPWCSzCXJvRYgU","content":[{"title":"Network","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/resources/recipes/network/"},{"title":"Adobe","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-js/Global%20Members/Data%20Transfers/fetch/"},{"title":"UXP Manifest Network Permission Denied for Fetch, Despite \"domains: all\" - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-manifest-network-permission-denied-for-fetch-despite-domains-all/10557"},{"title":"Issue with manifest v>5: domain permissions (fetch error) - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/issue-with-manifest-v-5-domain-permissions-fetch-error/4714"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"Cannot pull information from internal server with UXP plugin","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/indesign-discussions/cannot-pull-information-from-internal-server-with-uxp-plugin/td-p/13984073"},{"title":"Accessing APIs · Adobe XD Plugin Reference","url":"https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/reference/core/apis.html"},{"title":"The fetch api - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/the-fetch-api/688"},{"title":"Plugin manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #13 Manifest v5 | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/adobe-uxp-things-you-need-to-know-manifest-5"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about Adobe UXP plugin network permissions and using the fetch API for external backend communication:\n\n## Network Permissions in Adobe UXP Plugins\n\nTo ensure that plugins are secure, UXP requires that plugins declare the permissions they need to function.\n\n### Manifest Configuration\n\nIn plugins, you should seek permission for access in the manifest and specify the domains of the endpoints.(no content)The manifest specifies the domains that the plugin can access in network requests.
