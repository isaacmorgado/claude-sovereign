You can already try the open source version and reach out to learn more about Spleeter Pro and how it can be integrated in your company tools.(no content)Spleeter Pro offers precise audio separation, faster processing speeds, and dedicated professional support.\n\n## 2025 Status and Comparison with Alternatives\n\nAs of 2025, Spleeter has not had major updates since 2019 release (no Spleeter v2 with better quality). Meanwhile, other models surpassed it in quality.

The main uses of VAD are in speaker diarization, speech coding and speech recognition.\n\n## Algorithm Design\n\nThe typical design of a VAD algorithm involves first a noise reduction stage (e.g., via spectral subtraction), then some features or quantities are calculated from a section of the input signal. A classification rule is applied to classify the section as speech or non-speech – often this classification rule finds when a value exceeds a certain threshold.\n\n## Threshold-Based Approaches\n\n### Energy Thresholding\nTo choose a suitable threshold, we can observe that areas in the speech signal with little activity have an energy below 17 dB, whereby we can set the threshold at θ_SILENCE := 17dB.(no content)Algorithmic approaches in classical VAD include thresholding, where silence frames with less energy are removed based on a set threshold, thereby reducing computational complexity and improving modeling accuracy.\n\n### SNR-Based Thresholds\nOne VAD system's performance is enhanced by carefully chosen parameters, including a window length of 0.31 seconds and a signal-to-noise ratio threshold of 90 dB. These parameters enable accurate identification of speech intervals amidst challenging acoustic environments.(no content)In some approaches, a frame with a residual value greater than a threshold value of 25 is considered a voice frame; otherwise, it is a silence frame. Results show this strategy is robust at SNR values of 1 dB, 2 dB, 10 dB, and 25 dB.\n\n## Modern Approaches (2025)\n\n### K-Means Weighted Thresholding\nA recent 2025 study extended K-means clustering to a thresholding algorithm for discriminating voiced/speech segments from silent segments from audio or speech signals. The voice signal was fragmented into frames for analysis.(no content)The K-means clustering algorithm was used for computing the intrinsic threshold value of the speech signal, with the minimum spectral power of each frame being the input feature. The centroid values and the number of data points for each cluster were utilized to compute a weighted average, which serves as the threshold value. Any frame whose minimum power spectral value was greater than the threshold value was considered a voiced frame.\n\n### Deep Learning vs Traditional Methods\nModern deep-learning detectors deliver superior accuracy in noisy conditions compared to traditional threshold-based approaches.(no content)In practice, production teams layer these families: an energy gate for millisecond-level latency, a statistical model for stability, and a neural network when accuracy in unpredictable noise becomes non-negotiable.\n\n## Traditional VAD Features\n\nTraditional VAD systems use hand-crafted features based on acoustic properties: energy levels (speech is louder than silence), zero-crossing rate (speech has predictable patterns), spectral features (human speech occupies specific frequency ranges), pitch detection (speech has pitch, noise typically doesn't), and signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nSetting the energy threshold is a complex process. At SNR=0dB, a 1dB change in the threshold has a large impact on performance.(no content)Energy-based methods include simple threshold (where energy above is considered speech and energy below is silence) and max/current ratio (where the ratio of maximum energy and current energy value is compared to a threshold). Both methods can be combined with webrtcvad for improved accuracy.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"33450e76-8289-4b50-add9-cf18c7aa0a52","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:14:55.769Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"audio silence detection algorithm threshold dB voice activity detection 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01CtjRQRgn37j5B48ZAat1Pd","content":[{"title":"(PDF) A simple but efficient voice activity detection algorithm through Hilbert transform and dynamic threshold for speech pathologies","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/302870286_A_simple_but_efficient_voice_activity_detection_algorithm_through_Hilbert_transform_and_dynamic_threshold_for_speech_pathologies"},{"title":"Voice activity detection (VAD) - Introduction to Speech Processing - Aalto University Wiki","url":"https://wiki.aalto.fi/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=151500905"},{"title":"8.1.

Any frame whose minimum power spectral value was greater than the threshold value was considered a voiced frame.\n\n### Deep Learning vs Traditional Methods\nModern deep-learning detectors deliver superior accuracy in noisy conditions compared to traditional threshold-based approaches.(no content)In practice, production teams layer these families: an energy gate for millisecond-level latency, a statistical model for stability, and a neural network when accuracy in unpredictable noise becomes non-negotiable.\n\n## Traditional VAD Features\n\nTraditional VAD systems use hand-crafted features based on acoustic properties: energy levels (speech is louder than silence), zero-crossing rate (speech has predictable patterns), spectral features (human speech occupies specific frequency ranges), pitch detection (speech has pitch, noise typically doesn't), and signal-to-noise ratio.\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nSetting the energy threshold is a complex process. At SNR=0dB, a 1dB change in the threshold has a large impact on performance.(no content)Energy-based methods include simple threshold (where energy above is considered speech and energy below is silence) and max/current ratio (where the ratio of maximum energy and current energy value is compared to a threshold). Both methods can be combined with webrtcvad for improved accuracy."],"durationSeconds":29.754751458999934}}

You can configure this with the concurrency option.(no content)Alternatively, you can achieve concurrency by having multiple workers, and the documentation recommends this approach over using the concurrency option.(no content)This not only allows for distributed processing across machines but also provides a more scalable solution.\n\n### Production Best Practices\n\n#### 1. Error Handling\nIt is really useful to attach a handler for the error event which will be triggered when there are connection issues. This will be helpful when debugging your queues and prevent \"unhandled errors\".(no content)Another common issue, especially in production environments, is the fact that NodeJS by default will break if there are unhandled exceptions. This is not unique for BullMQ-based applications, but a general rule for all NodeJS applications.\n\n#### 2. Graceful Shutdown\nSince your workers will run on servers, it is unavoidable that these servers will need to be restarted from time to time. As your workers may be processing jobs when the server is about to restart, it is important to properly close the workers to minimize the risk of stalled jobs.(no content)If a worker is killed without waiting for their jobs to complete, these jobs will be marked as stalled and processed automatically when new workers come online (with a waiting time of about 30 seconds by default). However it is better to avoid having stalled jobs, and as mentioned this can be done by closing the workers when the server is going to be restarted.(no content)In a Node.js server, it is considered good practice to listen for both SIGINT and SIGTERM signals to close gracefully.\n\n#### 3. Redis Configuration\nRedis is used quite often as a cache, meaning that it will remove keys according to some defined policy when it reaches several levels of memory consumption. BullMQ on the other hand cannot work properly if Redis evicts keys arbitrarily. Therefore is very important to configure the maxmemory-policy setting to noeviction. This is the only setting that guarantees the correct behavior of the queues.\n\n#### 4. Connection Recovery\nIn a production setting, one of the things that are crucial for system robustness is to be able to recover automatically after connection issues. It is impossible to guarantee that a connection between BullMQ and Redis will always stay online. However, the important thing is that it recovers as fast as possible when the connection can be re-established without any human intervention.(no content)For IORedis connections created inside BullMQ we use the following strategy: In other words, it will retry using exponential backoff, with a minimum 1-second retry time and max of 20 seconds. This retryStrategy can easily be overridden by passing a custom one defining custom IORedis options.\n\n### Job Retry Configuration\nBullMQ provides robust job lifecycle handling with states like waiting, active, delayed, completed, failed etc. It includes delaying, retry failed jobs, and rate limiting capabilities.\n\n### Use Cases\nBullMQ has been successfully used in production to implement video transcoding, image processing, email sending, and many other types of background jobs.(no content)It's ideal for tasks that take time, like image or video processing, API calls, backups, and sending notifications or emails.\n\n### Alternative Backend\nDragonfly is a new Redis™ drop-in replacement that is fully compatible with BullMQ and brings some important advantages over Redis™ such as massive better performance by utilizing all CPU cores available and faster and more efficient data structures.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a73d9819-bac9-40a6-9556-632bd42bb586","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:14:58.113Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"BullMQ Node.js queue processing best practices 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01J4zhf94r2J7eFGKYtF5ws4","content":[{"title":"BullMQ - Background Jobs processing and message queue for NodeJS | BullMQ","url":"https://bullmq.io/"},{"title":"GitHub - taskforcesh/bullmq: BullMQ - Message Queue and Batch processing for NodeJS and Python based on Redis","url":"https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq"},{"title":"Job Scheduling in Node.js with BullMQ | Better Stack Community","url":"https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-nodejs/bullmq-scheduled-tasks/"},{"title":"What is BullMQ | BullMQ","url":"https://docs.bullmq.io"},{"title":"BullMQ - Ultimate Guide + Getting Started Tutorial [2025]","url":"https://www.dragonflydb.io/guides/bullmq"},{"title":"Going to production | BullMQ","url":"https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/going-to-production"},{"title":"Quick Start | BullMQ","url":"https://docs.bullmq.io/readme-1"},{"title":"How To Handle Asynchronous Tasks with Node.js and BullMQ | DigitalOcean","url":"https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-handle-asynchronous-tasks-with-node-js-and-bullmq"},{"title":"Message Queue in Node.js with BullMQ and Redis | by Suneel Kumar | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@techsuneel99/message-queue-in-node-js-with-bullmq-and-redis-7fe5b8a21475"},{"title":"bullmq - npm","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/bullmq"}]},"Here are the best practices for BullMQ Node.js queue processing based on the search results:\n\n## BullMQ Node.js Queue Processing Best Practices\n\n### Overview\nBullMQ is the fastest, most reliable, Redis-based distributed queue for Node.js, carefully written for rock solid stability and atomicity.(no content)It is backed by Redis, which makes it easy to scale horizontally and process jobs across multiple servers.\n\n### Concurrency Best Practices\nBullMQ allows you to set up concurrency, which determines how many jobs a worker can process simultaneously.

Presigned URLs provide a flexible and secure way to grant temporary access to S3 objects without compromising the security of your AWS credentials or making the object publicly accessible.\n\n### Key Features\n\nPre-signed URLs allow you to share or upload objects in Amazon S3 without requiring AWS security credentials or permissions. They grant time-limited download and upload access to objects or provide access to objects in a private bucket.\n\n### Expiration Times\n\nUsing IAM user credentials, presigned URLs can be valid up to 7 days when using AWS Signature Version 4. To create a presigned URL that's valid for up to 7 days, first delegate IAM user credentials (the access key and secret key) to the method you're using to create the presigned URL.(no content)If you create a presigned URL with the Amazon S3 console, the expiration time can be set between 1 minute and 12 hours. If you use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs, the expiration time can be set as high as 7 days.\n\n### Audio Processing Use Cases\n\nOnce you have an audio file uploaded to one of your S3 buckets, you can generate a presigned URL very easily from the AWS S3 website by clicking on your audio file, going to \"Object actions\" in the top-right corner, and clicking \"Share with a presigned URL\".(no content)The presigned PUT URL's expiration time must take into account the time it takes for the audio to be transcribed, which is why a default value of 10 minutes is used. Longer audio files will require longer expiration times for the PUT URL. You may need to find an expiration time that fits your use case.\n\n### Text-to-Speech Implementation Example\n\nIn one implementation, text created by the user is sent from the application to the server side via API request, and after text-to-speech synthesis on the server side, it is stored in the S3 folder under each user's directory in AWS. Since this audio is under the user directory with access restrictions as the default, a pre-signed URL is used to provide temporary access.(no content)The presign URL provides temporary access to an object in a cloud storage service (e.g., Amazon S3). This URL is signed with specific permissions and expiration dates, allowing you to securely download or upload files without direct access to your cloud storage credentials.\n\n### Uploading Files with Pre-signed URLs\n\nYou may use presigned URLs to allow someone to upload an object to your Amazon S3 bucket. Using a presigned URL will allow an upload without requiring another party to have AWS security credentials or permissions. A presigned URL is limited by the permissions of the user who creates it.\n\n### Benefits for Media Uploads\n\nPre-signed URLs allow users to upload files directly to Amazon S3 without going through your application server. When using pre-signed URLs, the file upload is handled directly between the client and Amazon S3, bypassing your server. This can reduce the load on your server, making it more scalable, especially in scenarios with a large number of file uploads.\n\n### Content Type Considerations\n\nDefine Content Type in the URL query parameters. If it is not defined, the object will be uploaded with the default content type, which may lead to incorrect interpretation or processing of the file. For example, image/jpeg or image/png for images and video/mp4 or video/mp3 for videos and audios.\n\n### Serverless Architecture Benefits\n\nIf you are using a serverless architecture with API Gateway and Lambda, implementing upload and download functionalities gets more complicated because you are constrained by strict payload size limits (Lambda request/response payloads are both limited to 6 MB) and time limits (API Gateway will timeout after 29 seconds). S3 pre-signed URLs provide a solution to implement upload and download functionality in an easy yet reliable way on AWS.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e7534b44-9485-48b6-923f-23ef8a21ff82","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:15:29.247Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"AWS S3 pre-signed URLs temporary file storage audio processing","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01VDx5nhzqqWHJ2E2ubE6XYD","content":[{"title":"Sharing objects with presigned URLs - Amazon Simple Storage Service","url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/ShareObjectPreSignedURL.html"},{"title":"Download and upload objects with presigned URLs - Amazon Simple Storage Service","url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-presigned-url.html"},{"title":"Uploading objects with presigned URLs - Amazon Simple Storage Service","url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html"},{"title":"AWS S3 Presigned URLs and Deepgram | Deepgram's Docs","url":"https://developers.deepgram.com/docs/using-aws-s3-presigned-urls-with-the-deepgram-api"},{"title":"[AWS] How to manage access restrictions on text-to-speech files using S3 signed URLs. | by Kazutaka Yoshinaga | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@kazutaka.yoshinaga/aws-how-to-manage-access-restrictions-on-text-to-speech-files-using-s3-signed-urls-59b2cff02c39"},{"title":"Presigned URLs - KodeKloud Notes","url":"https://notes.kodekloud.com/docs/Amazon-Simple-Storage-Service-Amazon-S3/AWS-S3-Advanced-Features/Presigned-URLs"},{"title":"Presigned URLs - Boto3 1.42.10 documentation","url":"https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/s3-presigned-urls.html"},{"title":"A Guide to S3 Pre-Signed URLs: What They Are and How They Work | Community","url":"https://community.forwardnetworks.com/cloud-78/a-guide-to-s3-pre-signed-urls-what-they-are-and-how-they-work-514"},{"title":"AWS S3 Pre-Signed URLs: Your Key to Secure Media Uploads - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/ehsaantech/aws-s3-pre-signed-urls-your-key-to-secure-media-uploads-35kl"},{"title":"The illustrated guide to S3 pre-signed URLs - fourTheorem","url":"https://fourtheorem.com/the-illustrated-guide-to-s3-pre-signed-urls/"}]},"Here are the search results for AWS S3 pre-signed URLs for temporary file storage and audio processing:\n\n## AWS S3 Pre-signed URLs Overview\n\nA presigned URL is a time-limited URL that provides temporary access to an object stored in an S3 bucket.

A VAD classifies a piece of audio data as being voiced or unvoiced. It can be useful for telephony and speech recognition.\n\n### Installation\nYou can install it via pip:\n```\npip install webrtcvad\n```\n\n### Key Features\n- The VAD that Google developed for the WebRTC project is reportedly one of the best available, being fast, modern and free.\n- Optionally, set its aggressiveness mode, which is an integer between 0 and 3 (inclusive). 0 is the least aggressive about filtering out non-speech, 3 is the most aggressive.\n- The WebRTC VAD only accepts 16-bit mono PCM audio, sampled at 8000, 16000, 32000 or 48000 Hz.\n\n### Alternative: webrtcvad-wheels\n\nThis is a Python interface to the WebRTC Voice Activity Detector (VAD). It is forked from wiseman/py-webrtcvad to provide updated releases with binary wheels for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Also includes additional fixes and improvements.(no content)This fork adds Python 3.12 & 3.13 builds and fixes pkg_resources usage for Python 3.12+.\n\n### Related Library: libfvad\n\nThis is a fork of the VAD engine that is part of the WebRTC Native Code package for use as a standalone library independent from the rest of the WebRTC code.

It can be useful for telephony and speech recognition.\n\n### Installation\nYou can install it via pip:\n```\npip install webrtcvad\n```\n\n### Key Features\n- The VAD that Google developed for the WebRTC project is reportedly one of the best available, being fast, modern and free.\n- Optionally, set its aggressiveness mode, which is an integer between 0 and 3 (inclusive). 0 is the least aggressive about filtering out non-speech, 3 is the most aggressive.\n- The WebRTC VAD only accepts 16-bit mono PCM audio, sampled at 8000, 16000, 32000 or 48000 Hz.\n\n### Alternative: webrtcvad-wheels\n\nThis is a Python interface to the WebRTC Voice Activity Detector (VAD). It is forked from wiseman/py-webrtcvad to provide updated releases with binary wheels for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Also includes additional fixes and improvements.(no content)This fork adds Python 3.12 & 3.13 builds and fixes pkg_resources usage for Python 3.12+.\n\n### Related Library: libfvad\n\nThis is a fork of the VAD engine that is part of the WebRTC Native Code package for use as a standalone library independent from the rest of the WebRTC code. There are currently no changes in functionality.\n\n### Resources\n- **GitHub Repository**: https://github.com/wiseman/py-webrtcvad\n- **PyPI**: https://pypi.org/project/webrtcvad/\n- **webrtcvad-wheels (updated fork)**: https://pypi.org/project/webrtcvad-wheels/"],"durationSeconds":17.497962874999967}}

In studies of time perception, durations around 0.6-0.7 s are considered as neither long nor short. Perceptually, the pause duration of 0.6 s therefore might be considered as natural in English speech, regardless of the listener's language background.\n\n### Types of Pauses\n\nResearchers have marked out three types of pauses based on origin: (1) regular natural pauses caused by respiration activity (breath pauses), (2) irregular intentional pauses, purposely used as a stylistic form, especially by professional speakers (silent pauses), and (3) irregular, unintentional disfluencies, effects of uncertainty, hesitations or short reflections (acoustic events like silent pauses or filled pauses).\n\n### Factors Affecting Pause Duration\n\nDepending on the speaker and situational/social context, pauses may be characterized by different properties. One factor is the type of personality of the speaker and speaking habits. Another important factor is speaker preparation for the task, level of oratorical skills, and elocution abilities. Durations of pauses also depend on the kind of linguistic task, and stress during speaking is an important factor dictating the frequency and lengths of pauses.\n\n### Cognitive Processing and Pauses\n\nPatterns of pausing in speech are thought to represent multiple levels of central nervous system (CNS) processing that support speech production. Long pauses have been assumed to represent cognitive-linguistic processes and short pauses to represent articulatory processes.\n\n### Detection Methods\n\nFor finding silent pauses in recordings, an ITU-T G.729b compliant voice activity detector (VAD) can be used, which relies on full band energy, low band energy, zero-crossing rate and a spectral measure to make decisions.(no content)For filled pause detection tasks, researchers split each utterance to fixed-size time windows with a step of 50 msec. Each window is filled with the token of the word that occurs in the corresponding time interval. If no word occurs, it is filled with the silence token.\n\n### Speech Production Latencies\n\nGiven the latencies of speech production (over 600 ms), incoming turns have to be predicted if accurate timing is to be achieved.(no content)The average reaction from seeing a picture to beginning naming has been estimated at 600 ms.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"f474c1ec-9043-47e1-ace9-cfa87ad19859","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:15:55.947Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"natural speech pause detection milliseconds timing linguistics","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01UosKZBzKhrDmTeLpnhCrw9","content":[{"title":"Using Pause Information for More Accurate Entity ...","url":"https://aclanthology.org/2021.nlp4convai-1.22.pdf"},{"title":"Structure of pauses in speech in the context of speaker verification and classification of speech type | EURASIP Journal on Audio, Speech, and Music Processing | Full Text","url":"https://asmp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s13636-016-0096-7"},{"title":"Timing in turn-taking and its implications for processing models of language - PMC","url":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4464110/"},{"title":"Frontiers | How Pause Duration Influences Impressions of English Speech: Comparison Between Native and Non-native Speakers","url":"https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2022.778018/full"},{"title":"Audio and ASR-based Filled Pause Detection","url":"https://sail.usc.edu/publications/files/Chatziagapi-ACII2022.pdf"},{"title":"Pauses Between Sentences and Paragraphs in Text-to-Speech Neural Networks","url":"https://speechgen.io/en/node/custom-pausa/"},{"title":"Pauses and the Temporal Structure of Speech","url":"https://web-archive.southampton.ac.uk/cogprints.org/884/3/Zellner.SpeechPauses.pdf"},{"title":"(PDF) Empty Speech Pause Detection Algorithms' Comparison","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259470072_Empty_Speech_Pause_Detection_Algorithms'_Comparison"},{"title":"How Pause Duration Influences Impressions of English Speech: Comparison Between Native and Non-native Speakers - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8874014/"},{"title":"Algorithmic Estimation of Pauses in Extended Speech Samples of Dysarthric and Typical Speech - PMC","url":"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC2902000/"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about natural speech pause detection, timing, and linguistics:\n\n## Key Findings on Speech Pause Timing\n\n### Typical Pause Durations\n\nAbout half a century ago, Brady (1968) reported average gap durations of 345–456 ms and medians from 264 to 347 ms (depending on the threshold used in automatic detection of speech) in turn-taking scenarios.(no content)The physical comma- and period-pause duration in natural speech is typically 1:2 ratio.

ElevenLabs has 5 different plans:\n- **Starter**: $4.17 per month\n- **Creator**: $11.00 per month\n- **Pro**: $82.50 per month\n- **Scale**: $275.00 per month\n- **Business**: $1,100.00 per month\n\n### Credit System & Per-Character Costs\n\nAPI usage depends on your plan, but typically costs around $0.20 per 1,000 characters for standard voices. Rates may be higher for licensed or custom voices, and usage is deducted from your plan's credit balance.(no content)1,000 credits equal roughly one minute of speech output.\n\n### Free Plan\n\nThe Free plan offers 10k credits/month (~10 min TTS or 15 min Conversational AI), perfect for exploring text-to-speech and video translation.\n\n### Audio Isolation (Voice Isolator)\n\nElevenLabs offers a Voice Isolator feature as one of their products, but the search results did not provide specific per-minute pricing for the audio isolation feature. ElevenLabs charges by model type and feature usage. Each product category—like Text-to-Speech or Dubbing—has its own pricing logic based on characters, minutes, or hours.\n\n### Pricing Model Notes\n\nBy August 2025, ElevenLabs simplified its pricing. Instead of multiple usage pools, they unified character credits again—regardless of model (Multilingual or Flash). Plans became more transparent: each tier clearly defined how many characters you could use, what models you had access to, and how many voice slots, cloning credits, and dubbing entitlements were included.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date pricing specifically for audio isolation, I recommend checking ElevenLabs' official pricing page directly at elevenlabs.io/pricing, as the specific per-minute cost for the Voice Isolator feature wasn't detailed in the search results.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"d0bd2d25-ddd3-4a66-ba3a-000d538b8893","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:16:22.452Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"ElevenLabs API pricing per minute audio isolation cost 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Ke7U9fWFdL1wAEZuEfezHY","content":[{"title":"ElevenLabs API Pricing — Build AI Audio Into Your Product","url":"https://elevenlabs.io/pricing/api"},{"title":"ElevenLabs Pricing for Creators & Businesses of All Sizes","url":"https://elevenlabs.io/pricing"},{"title":"The Complete Guide to ElevenLabs Plans Overages and Usage Based Pricing","url":"https://flexprice.io/blog/elevenlabs-pricing-breakdown"},{"title":"ElevenLabs Pricing & Alternatives - 2025 Guide","url":"https://www.callpod.ai/blog/elevenlabs-pricing"},{"title":"ElevenLabs Pricing Plans | A Complete Breakdown · WebsiteVoice Blog | Add Free Text-to-Speech to Your Site","url":"https://websitevoice.com/blog/elevenlabs-pricing-plans/"},{"title":"ElevenLabs pricing: A complete breakdown for 2025 - eesel AI","url":"https://www.eesel.ai/blog/elevenlabs-pricing"},{"title":"ElevenLabs Pricing (December 2025): Compare Plans & Find the Best One | SaaSworthy","url":"https://www.saasworthy.com/product/elevenlabs-io/pricing"},{"title":"How much does it cost to use the API? – ElevenLabs","url":"https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/articles/28184926326033-How-much-does-it-cost-to-use-the-API"},{"title":"Eleven Labs Software Pricing 2025","url":"https://www.g2.com/products/elevenlabsio/pricing"},{"title":"ElevenLabs Pricing & Plans: How Much It Costs in 2025?","url":"https://affmaven.com/elevenlabs-pricing/"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about ElevenLabs API pricing and audio-related costs in 2025:\n\n## ElevenLabs API Pricing Overview\n\nThe API is included in all plans, even the free plan, and there is no extra cost associated with the API except for the cost of the actual generation.\n\n### Pricing Plans (2025)\n\nThe pricing for ElevenLabs starts at $4.17 per month.

This performance can be further enhanced through batching or GPU usage, with ONNX potentially offering a 4-5 times speed increase under certain conditions.\n\n### Benchmarks vs WebRTC VAD\n\nSileroVAD has been evaluated using the LibriParty dataset and AVA Spoken Activities Datasets, demonstrating significantly higher accuracy than the webrtc-vad.(no content)Currently, there are hardly any high quality / modern / free / public voice activity detectors except for WebRTC Voice Activity Detector.

It supports up to 10-stem separation including vocals, drums, bass, piano, guitars, synthesizers, and more, powered by state-of-the-art neural networks like Perseus and Orion.(no content)There are several stem separation types you can choose from. One separation type is applied at a time, giving you two stems per file. Depending on the selected type, you receive a pair of vocal and instrumental stems, isolated drums + drumless stem, isolated bass + bassless stem, etc.\n\n## Pricing Structure\n\nEach LALAL.AI package comes with a limit on how many minutes worth of audio/video are available for splitting. The length of every fully split file is deducted from the package minute limit. You can split as many files as you want as long as their total length doesn't exceed the minute limit of your package.(no content)For example, when you get the Starter pack that comes with a 10-minute limit, you can split 10 minutes worth of audio or video in total. So, with this limit, you can split one 10-minute track, two 5-minute tracks, or about three 3-minute tracks.\n\nSome pricing tiers mentioned:\n- Basic: $15 per month (90 minutes). Professional: $25 per month (300 minutes).(no content)Minutes are deducted from the account by the following formula: Total file length x stem separation type(s) number. For example, selected separation types: Drums, Piano and Vocal/Instrumental. Total number of deducted minutes: 5 minutes x 3 stem separation types = 15 minutes.\n\n## API & Business Solutions\n\nLALAL.AI offers enterprise solutions to enrich your business with the leading AI-powered technology. You can integrate the music source separation algorithm into your application or website using API, provide clients with high-quality outcome, and isolate voice and instruments in audio and video files with utmost precision.(no content)The business solution lets your clients upload files and extract stems on your end. Processing and splitting are running on their servers. Features include guaranteed exclusive access to all processed content, no data shared with third parties, flexible scaling in accordance with the needs of your business, and a pay-as-you-go payment option available to simplify the audit process.(no content)The service offers smooth deployment of the solution to your environment, API integration for convenient operation and seamless data transfer, and dedicated support manager and tech team to optimize the performance and ensure the success of the operation.\n\n## Processing Modes\n\nThere is a limited amount of minutes you can process in Fast mode, whereas in Relaxed mode, you can split as many minutes as you want without limits. Note that you can't switch between the modes. At the beginning of each month, all tracks are processed in Fast mode until the minute limit is reached. After that, tracks automatically start to be split in Relaxed mode.\n\nFor enterprise API pricing, LALAL.AI requires you to \"Request a Quote\" through their business solutions page, as they offer custom pricing for business integrations.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"fbdbab4d-9863-470f-ab8a-203c1d52a798","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:16:29.658Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"LALAL.AI audio separation API pricing stem splitting","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01QAigwMSC6dtBJYFz5hdZe4","content":[{"title":"Vocal Remover & Instrumental AI Splitter | LALAL.AI","url":"https://www.lalal.ai/"},{"title":"Pricing | LALAL.AI","url":"https://www.lalal.ai/pricing/"},{"title":"API | LALAL.AI","url":"https://www.lalal.ai/api/"},{"title":"LALAL.AI Business Solution | Stem Splitting for Your Service","url":"https://www.lalal.ai/business-solutions/"},{"title":"Lalal.ai - AI-Powered Vocal Remover and Music Stem Splitter | Siteefy","url":"https://siteefy.com/tools/lalal-ai"},{"title":"AI Apps for Vocal Removal, Stem Separation, Noise Reduction | LALAL.AI","url":"https://www.lalal.ai/apps-and-plugins/"},{"title":"Tools & API | LALAL.AI","url":"https://www.lalal.ai/tools-and-api/"},{"title":"Stem splitters, whats the best?

Professional: $25 per month (300 minutes).(no content)Minutes are deducted from the account by the following formula: Total file length x stem separation type(s) number. For example, selected separation types: Drums, Piano and Vocal/Instrumental. Total number of deducted minutes: 5 minutes x 3 stem separation types = 15 minutes.\n\n## API & Business Solutions\n\nLALAL.AI offers enterprise solutions to enrich your business with the leading AI-powered technology. You can integrate the music source separation algorithm into your application or website using API, provide clients with high-quality outcome, and isolate voice and instruments in audio and video files with utmost precision.(no content)The business solution lets your clients upload files and extract stems on your end.

Unlike other solutions, SQS is serverless, meaning AWS handles infrastructure, scaling, and maintenance automatically.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- SQS offers two queue types: Standard Queue (best-effort ordering, at-least-once delivery) and FIFO Queue (strict ordering, exactly-once processing).\n- Fully managed with no need to manage infrastructure. Highly available and backed by AWS's infrastructure, offering automatic scaling and durability.\n- No setup required; it's a plug-and-play solution within the AWS ecosystem. Automatically scales to handle large volumes of messages with seamless integration with other AWS services like Lambda and SNS.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- SQS has higher latency (~10-100ms due to AWS network overhead), message duplication can occur with Standard Queue, and limited retention time (4-14 days).\n- SQS is very affordable for small-to-medium workloads but can get expensive with high-volume traffic.\n\n### **BullMQ**\n\nBullMQ is a job and message queue that relies on Dragonfly or Redis for storage. It offers robust features such as priority-based queues, delayed jobs, scheduling, and more.(no content)BullMQ is a Node.js library that uses robust quest systems built on top of Redis designed for resolving problems in microservices architecture.\n\n**Key Features:**\n- BullMQ works on a class system that is used together to resolve problems. It consists of five classes—Queue, Worker, Queue Scheduler, Queue Events, and FlowProducer.\n- BullMQ is a Node.js library that implements a fast and robust queue system built on top of Redis. The reason it's built on an in-memory DB like Redis is for fast access.\n- Bull/BullMQ is designed to scale horizontally, allowing you to distribute your workload across multiple processes or even machines.\n\n### **Real-World Migration Experiences**\n\nOne developer initially tried using the SQS Consumer library to process over a million uptime checks per week, but found that the SQS Consumer library couldn't keep up. It also didn't process the jobs in order, which made some jobs never even run.(no content)After research, they found BullMQ. BullMQ replaces the SQS queue with a Redis instance, and handles the job creating and running.(no content)Another developer handling 2 million background jobs a day in NestJS with BullMQ reported considering moving to BullMQ from SQS because of \"the annoyances of SQS architecture.\"\n\n### **When to Choose Each**\n\n**Choose AWS SQS when:**\n- You want a fully managed cloud solution with zero maintenance, you are using AWS Lambda or cloud-native microservices, or you need simple message queuing with automatic scaling.\n\n**Choose BullMQ when:**\n- You need priority queues, delayed jobs, and scheduling features\n- You're building Node.js applications and want tighter control\n- You need fast access without the overhead when the consumer fetches messages from a queue, as high latency would make the process extremely inefficient.\n- You want to avoid SQS's network latency and potential message ordering issues\n\n### **Integration Note**\n\nBullMQ does not directly integrate with Amazon SQS.

However, frequent retries can overload network bandwidth and cause contention. Exponential backoff is a technique where operations are retried by increasing wait times for a specified number of retry attempts.(no content)It's not always safe to retry. A retry can increase the load on the system being called, if the system is already failing because it's approaching an overload. To avoid this problem, we implement our clients to use backoff. This increases the time between subsequent retries, which keeps the load on the backend even.\n\n## Importance of Idempotency for Retries\n\nIf multiple calls to the method have the same effect as a single call on the system state, the operation is considered idempotent. Operations should be idempotent when you use the retry with backoff pattern. Otherwise, partial updates might corrupt the system state.(no content)For operations that modify state (e.g., creating a record, processing a payment), ensure they are idempotent. This means that performing the same operation multiple times (due to retries) has the same effect as performing it once. If an operation isn't naturally idempotent, you may need to implement idempotency keys or other mechanisms to prevent duplicate actions.(no content)If your processing were idempotent, you can simply retry the entire batch and not worry about such details. That is powerful!\n\n## Adding Jitter to Prevent Thundering Herd\n\nIf all the failed calls back off to the same time, they cause contention or overload again when they are retried. Our solution is jitter. Jitter adds some amount of randomness to the backoff to spread the retries around in time.(no content)In our previous approach, the client waits are progressively longer but still synchronized. Adding jitter provides a way to break the synchronization across the clients thereby avoiding collisions. In this approach, we add randomness to the wait intervals.\n\n## Implementation Examples\n\nDefer allows you to configure two types of retry strategies: the exponential backoff strategy and the linear retry strategy. In a backoff retry strategy, the system increases the delay between consecutive retries after each attempt. The delay is increasing exponentially.(no content)If the call to the Get sentiment Lambda function fails, the workflow retries the operation three times. AWS Step Functions allows exponential backoff by letting you configure the backoff value. In this example, a maximum of three retries are configured with an increase multiplier of 1.5 seconds. If the first retry occurs after 3 seconds, the second retry occurs after 3 x 1.5 seconds = 4.5 seconds, and the third retry occurs after 4.5 x 1.5 seconds = 6.75 seconds.\n\n## Dead Letter Queues for Failed Jobs\n\nA dead letter queue (DLQ) is a home of last resort when everything else fails. Records might end up here when the data is corrupted or has simply changed from what was expected. Longer running issues (if there was an outage that extended beyond your last retry cycle) may result in errors being placed here as well.\n\n## Best Practices\n\nExponential backoff can lead to very long backoff times, because exponential functions grow quickly. To avoid retrying for too long, implementations typically cap their backoff to a maximum value. This is called, predictably, capped exponential backoff.(no content)Retry mechanisms, especially those incorporating exponential backoff with jitter, are fundamental for building robust and resilient distributed systems. By intelligently handling transient failures, they significantly improve application reliability, enhance user experience, and reduce the operational overhead associated with network and service unpredictability.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c7539114-487c-466b-89b8-5e9b8a97fcce","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:17:36.253Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"audio processing job retry strategy exponential backoff idempotency","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01WHD8bpzJaLaDtH63j2ExjY","content":[{"title":"Retry with backoff pattern - AWS Prescriptive Guidance","url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/prescriptive-guidance/latest/cloud-design-patterns/retry-backoff.html"},{"title":"Building Resilient Systems: The Power of Retry Mechanisms with Exponential Backoff | by Eshika Shah | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@eshikashah2001/building-resilient-systems-the-power-of-retry-mechanisms-with-exponential-backoff-60bebad6a57b"},{"title":"Retries - Defer docs","url":"https://www.defer.run/docs/features/retries"},{"title":"Retry resilience strategy | Polly","url":"https://www.pollydocs.org/strategies/retry.html"},{"title":"Retry strategy | Cloud Storage | Google Cloud Documentation","url":"https://docs.cloud.google.com/storage/docs/retry-strategy"},{"title":"Timeouts, retries and backoff with jitter","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/builders-library/timeouts-retries-and-backoff-with-jitter/"},{"title":"Exponential backoff - Wikipedia","url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_backoff"},{"title":"Highly Reliable Processing with Amazon SQS and Lambda | by Andy Tarpley | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@andy.tarpley/highly-reliable-processing-with-amazon-sqs-and-lambda-bcbfb0262490"},{"title":"Better Retries with Exponential Backoff and Jitter | Baeldung","url":"https://www.baeldung.com/resilience4j-backoff-jitter"},{"title":"Implement retries with exponential backoff - .NET | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/implement-resilient-applications/implement-retries-exponential-backoff"}]},"Here are the search results for your query about audio processing job retry strategies with exponential backoff and idempotency:\n\n## Overview\n\nExponential backoff is an algorithm that uses feedback to multiplicatively decrease the rate of some process, in order to gradually find an acceptable rate.(no content)Retries with exponential backoff is a technique that retries an operation, with an exponentially increasing wait time, up to a maximum retry count has been reached.\n\n## Why Use Exponential Backoff for Job Processing\n\nAutomatically retrying operations that fail because of transient errors improves the user experience and application resilience.
