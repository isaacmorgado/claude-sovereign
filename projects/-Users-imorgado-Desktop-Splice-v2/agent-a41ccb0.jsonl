These routes act as server-side functions that respond to HTTP requests — similar to traditional REST APIs.(no content)In the App Router (introduced in Next.js 13+ and improved in v15), you create a file called `route.ts` (or `route.js`) inside any subfolder under `app/api/`. This file defines your API endpoint.\n\n### File Structure\n\nThe app directory structure includes API endpoints organized as folders with `route.ts` files for GET/POST handlers. Each folder represents a route, and the `page.tsx` file is what gets rendered.\n\n### Backend Architecture Patterns\n\nNext.js Route Handlers can serve as a \"Backend for Frontend\" or BFF.(no content)Sometimes you want to hide or consolidate external microservices behind a single endpoint. Next.js Route Handlers can act as a proxy or middle layer to another existing backend. For instance, you might intercept requests, handle authentication, transform data, and then pass the request along to an upstream API.\n\n### Serverless Deployment\n\nWhen you deploy to platforms like Vercel, your API routes become serverless functions. When someone requests data from your API, the platform spins up a function, processes the request, sends the response, and then shuts down. This means you only pay for the actual computing time you use, and your application can automatically scale to handle thousands of requests.(no content)The architecture can also support hybrid approaches where some routes are serverless functions while others run on persistent servers. This flexibility means you can start simple and evolve your architecture as your application grows.\n\n### Use Cases & Limitations\n\nNext.js enables developers to create APIs in the same project as the frontend. For small to medium-sized apps, this is usually enough. You can manage things like form processing, authentication, or database access. No additional backend server is needed, making the architecture simple and inexpensive.(no content)API Routes are convenient — perfect for small logic co-located with your frontend. They're not a backend replacement for complex or high-scale apps.(no content)Each route is deployed as a serverless function. That means: Cold starts (first requests can be slow), Stateless (no persistent state between requests), and Timeouts (long-running tasks may fail).\n\n### Modern Full-Stack Architecture\n\nModern full stack application architecture using Next.js 15 includes technologies like TypeScript, Server Actions, Server and Client Components, Auth.js, Tailwind CSS, Drizzle ORM, PostgreSQL, and Docker.(no content)Traditionally, handling data mutations in Next.js required creating separate API routes, which added complexity and boilerplate code. With the introduction of Server Actions, Next.js allows you to write server-side logic that can be directly invoked from client components.\n\n### When to Use a Dedicated Backend\n\nIf your app needs robust backend features, don't hesitate to spin up an Express or NestJS service.(no content)If your backend involves complex workflows, scheduling, message queues, or microservices — you'll need a dedicated backend.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"af6a06f4-02d5-49e5-8495-14e489d38db3","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:14:21.765Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Next.js 15 API routes backend architecture 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Evg8u5ADvvKptSS1k9s3GW","content":[{"title":"Routing: API Routes | Next.js","url":"https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes"},{"title":"Modern Full Stack Application Architecture Using Next.js 15+","url":"https://softwaremill.com/modern-full-stack-application-architecture-using-next-js-15/"},{"title":"Building APIs with Next.js | Next.js","url":"https://nextjs.org/blog/building-apis-with-nextjs"},{"title":"Best Practices for Organizing Your Next.js 15 2025 - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/bajrayejoon/best-practices-for-organizing-your-nextjs-15-2025-53ji"},{"title":"Nextjs API Calls 2025","url":"https://medium.com/@turingvang/nextjs-api-calls-2025-63049c32bac1"},{"title":"Build API with Next.js 2025","url":"https://www.biztechcs.com/blog/building-api-with-nextjs/"},{"title":"Getting Started with Backend Development in Next.js 15: A Beginner's Guide to REST APIs - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/fonyuygita/getting-started-with-backend-development-in-nextjs-15-a-beginners-guide-to-rest-apis-4hk2"},{"title":"Why API Routes in Next.js Aren’t a Backend Replacement (and How to Use Them Safely) | by Shreyan | Sep, 2025 | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@shreyanbharadwaj/why-api-routes-in-next-js-arent-a-backend-replacement-and-how-to-use-them-safely-e29816fa2ddd"},{"title":"Next.js Best Practices in 2025: Performance & Architecture","url":"https://www.raftlabs.com/blog/building-with-next-js-best-practices-and-benefits-for-performance-first-teams/"},{"title":"API Routes","url":"https://jsmastery.com/course/the-ultimate-next-js-15-course/practical-crash-course/api-routes-nextjs"}]},"Based on my search, here's a comprehensive overview of Next.js 15 API routes and backend architecture in 2025:\n\n## Next.js 15 API Routes & Backend Architecture\n\n### How API Routes Work in Next.js 15\n\nIn Next.js 15, API routes are handled inside the `app/` directory using files like `route.ts` (or `route.js`).

At the core of BullMQ's architecture is Redis, an in-memory data structure store that enables the queue system to be fast, reliable, and persistent.(no content)Redis is responsible for storing all queue data, managing job states, handling delayed jobs, coordinating workers, and ensuring consistency across distributed systems.\n\n### How Jobs Work\n\nFrom the moment a producer calls the add method on a Queue instance, a job enters a lifecycle where it will be in different states, until its completion or failure (although technically a failed job could be retried and get a new lifecycle).(no content)The next state for a job is the \"active\" state. The active state is represented by a set, and are jobs that are currently being processed (i.e. they are running in the process function). A job can be in the active state for an unlimited amount of time until the process is completed or an exception is thrown so that the job will end in either the \"completed\" or the \"failed\" status.\n\n### Redis Data Structures\n\nBullMQ uses Redis data types like lists, sets, sorted sets, and hashes to store and manage jobs. Each job is stored as a JSON object inside a Redis hash, indexed by job ID.\n\n### Key Design Goals\n\nThe library is designed to fulfill the following goals: Exactly once queue semantics, i.e., attempts to deliver every message exactly one time, but it will deliver at least once in the worst case scenario. Easy to scale horizontally. Add more workers for processing jobs in parallel.(no content)BullMQ tries to get the highest possible throughput from Redis by combining efficient .lua scripts and pipelining.\n\n### Key Features\n\nBullMQ is the modern version of Bull, built from scratch for performance and flexibility. It's powered by Redis and offers: Repeatable jobs, Delayed jobs, Rate limiting, Job retries, priorities, Flow (chained jobs), and UI monitoring (with bull-board).(no content)Scalability is one of the key features of BullMQ. Since it leverages Dragonfly/Redis, you can easily scale your applications by increasing the number of workers that process jobs. You have complete control over how many workers you want to use based on the workload.\n\n### Redis Connections\n\nEvery class will consume at least one Redis connection, but it is also possible to reuse connections in some situations. For example, the Queue and Worker classes can accept an existing ioredis instance, and by that reusing that connection, however QueueScheduler and QueueEvents cannot do that because they require blocking connections to Redis.\n\n### Recent Updates (2025)\n\nBullMQ has seen active development in 2025, with version 5.66.0 released on December 11, 2025, along with numerous updates throughout the year including versions 5.65.x, 5.64.x, 5.63.x, and many more.\n\n### Alternative Redis-Compatible Options\n\nDragonfly is a new Redis™ drop-in replacement that is fully compatible with BullMQ and brings some important advantages over Redis™ such as massive better performance by utilizing all CPU cores available and faster and more efficient data structures.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ff84559f-1b96-4d7b-8eb4-9ecd2e64efe7","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:14:25.333Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"BullMQ Redis job queue architecture 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01AhWJ7muSFUrmiaKYFGizSo","content":[{"title":"What is BullMQ | BullMQ","url":"https://docs.bullmq.io"},{"title":"GitHub - taskforcesh/bullmq: BullMQ - Message Queue and Batch processing for NodeJS and Python based on Redis","url":"https://github.com/taskforcesh/bullmq"},{"title":"BullMQ - Background Jobs processing and message queue for NodeJS | BullMQ","url":"https://bullmq.io/"},{"title":"Architecture | BullMQ","url":"https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/architecture"},{"title":"🚀 Using BullMQ and Redis in Your Node.js Backend: A Modern Guide to Background Job Processing | by Sindhu | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@sindhujad6/using-bullmq-and-redis-in-your-node-js-backend-a-modern-guide-to-background-job-processing-a4fb37953192"},{"title":"Changelogs | BullMQ","url":"https://docs.bullmq.io/changelog"},{"title":"BullMQ - Ultimate Guide + Getting Started Tutorial [2025]","url":"https://www.dragonflydb.io/guides/bullmq"},{"title":"BullMQ Redis: The Backbone of High-Performance Job Queues | by Raza | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@raza78749/bullmq-redis-the-backbone-of-high-performance-job-queues-a3a3090e3807"},{"title":"Building Scalable Job Queues with BullMQ: A Complete Guide with Image Processing Example | by Sani Patel | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@sanipatel0401/building-scalable-job-queues-with-bullmq-a-complete-guide-with-image-processing-example-88c58b550cb8"},{"title":"Connections | BullMQ","url":"https://docs.bullmq.io/guide/connections"}]},"Here are the search results for \"BullMQ Redis job queue architecture 2025\":\n\n## BullMQ Redis Job Queue Architecture\n\n### Overview\n\nBullMQ is a Node.js library that implements a fast and robust queue system built on top of Redis that helps in resolving many modern age micro-services architectures.(no content)BullMQ is a rewrite of the popular Bull library by the same authors, but with a new API and a more modern codebase written in Typescript and with a bunch of new features and performance improvements.\n\n### Core Architecture\n\nBullMQ is a modern and powerful job queueing system for Node.js applications, designed to handle background tasks, messaging, and job scheduling with ease.

Add more workers for processing jobs in parallel.(no content)BullMQ tries to get the highest possible throughput from Redis by combining efficient .lua scripts and pipelining.\n\n### Key Features\n\nBullMQ is the modern version of Bull, built from scratch for performance and flexibility. It's powered by Redis and offers: Repeatable jobs, Delayed jobs, Rate limiting, Job retries, priorities, Flow (chained jobs), and UI monitoring (with bull-board).(no content)Scalability is one of the key features of BullMQ. Since it leverages Dragonfly/Redis, you can easily scale your applications by increasing the number of workers that process jobs. You have complete control over how many workers you want to use based on the workload.\n\n### Redis Connections\n\nEvery class will consume at least one Redis connection, but it is also possible to reuse connections in some situations. For example, the Queue and Worker classes can accept an existing ioredis instance, and by that reusing that connection, however QueueScheduler and QueueEvents cannot do that because they require blocking connections to Redis.\n\n### Recent Updates (2025)\n\nBullMQ has seen active development in 2025, with version 5.66.0 released on December 11, 2025, along with numerous updates throughout the year including versions 5.65.x, 5.64.x, 5.63.x, and many more.\n\n### Alternative Redis-Compatible Options\n\nDragonfly is a new Redis™ drop-in replacement that is fully compatible with BullMQ and brings some important advantages over Redis™ such as massive better performance by utilizing all CPU cores available and faster and more efficient data structures."],"durationSeconds":28.733994999999997}}

It allows you to get something working quickly without the overhead of setting up multiple services. You can iterate faster when all your logic is in one place.(no content)If you have a small engineering team, the overhead of managing microservices can slow you down. A well-structured monolith is easier for a small team to build and maintain. It also requires less specialized DevOps expertise.(no content)Microservices benefits only appear with teams larger than 10 developers. Below this threshold, monoliths consistently perform better. The overhead of managing distributed systems simply doesn't justify itself.\n\n**Monolith advantages:**\n- Simplicity: Easier to develop, test, and deploy initially, making it ideal for smaller projects or teams. Performance: Inter-component communication is faster as it's done within a single process, avoiding network overhead. Easy debugging: A single application means straightforward debugging and logging.\n\n## When to Choose Microservices\n\nMicroservices bring the most benefits when: The app is modular and needs independent scaling of each function. Multiple teams are working on the project at the same time. The system must be fault-tolerant, and errors in one component shouldn't affect the operation of the entire application. You want to use different technologies and select them individually.\n\n**Microservices advantages:**\n- Independent scalability: Each service can scale independently, optimizing resources. Fault isolation: Issues in one service don't necessarily affect others, enhancing system resilience. Technological flexibility: Teams can choose the best technologies and programming languages for each service. Faster deployments: Individual services can be deployed frequently, reducing overall deployment risk.\n\n## 2025 Trend: The Rise of Modular Monoliths\n\nIn 2025, a modular monolith is described as a serious competitor to microservices. Many teams opt for this concept in new projects, usually choosing it as a solution between the monolithic and microservice routes.(no content)Modular monoliths combine the simplicity of monoliths with good practices from microservices architecture. The application runs as a single system but is clearly divided into independent modules with well-defined boundaries. This architectural pattern has gained significant traction because it delivers modularity benefits without distributed system complexity.\n\n## Real-World Examples\n\nWhile 89% of organizations have adopted microservices, major tech companies like Amazon Prime Video have actually moved back to monolithic architectures for specific use cases.(no content)Companies like Basecamp and Shopify have successfully scaled with monolithic foundations, proving this approach remains viable even at scale. GitHub's core application remains largely a Ruby on Rails monolith, serving millions of developers daily without issues.\n\n## Best Practices for 2025\n\n1. Start with a modular monolith, then move to microservices when scaling pain is real. Choose architecture based on business maturity, not hype.\n\n2. Build the simplest architecture that solves your actual problems. You can always evolve later when real constraints demand it.\n\n3. Most products don't fail due to scalability — they fail due to lack of product-market fit. Scaling prematurely increases complexity & cost without business value.\n\n4. Microservices implementation should be motivated by the project's real needs and not treated as a default solution. The real challenge isn't choosing between monolithic and microservices architectures – it's making your chosen approach work brilliantly for your specific needs.\n\n## Migration Considerations\n\nAs new features are added to a monolith, it may start to become cumbersome to have many developers working on a singular codebase. Code conflicts become more frequent and the risk of updates to one feature introducing bugs in an unrelated feature increases. When these undesirable patterns arise, it may be time to consider a migration to microservices.(no content)Start with a well-structured monolith. Identify bottlenecks and high-load areas. Gradually extract specific functionalities into microservices where it makes sense. Maintain both systems working together harmoniously.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a8e6d1aa-2265-4943-b89d-5326102ac58e","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:14:26.172Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"microservices vs monolith architecture 2025 best practices when to choose","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01B7uiGNRz2eCCJkaMWH5fjK","content":[{"title":"Microservices vs. monolithic architecture | Atlassian","url":"https://www.atlassian.com/microservices/microservices-architecture/microservices-vs-monolith"},{"title":"Monolithic vs Microservices Architecture: Pros and Cons for 2025 - Scalo","url":"https://www.scalosoft.com/blog/monolithic-vs-microservices-architecture-pros-and-cons-for-2025/"},{"title":"Microservices vs monolith: Pros, cons, and best practices","url":"https://graphite.com/guides/microservices-vs-monolith"},{"title":"Monolith vs Microservices: Making the Right Architectural Choice in 2025 🧱 - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/prateekbka/monolith-vs-microservices-making-the-right-architectural-choice-in-2025-4a27"},{"title":"Monolithic vs Microservices: Differences, Pros, & Cons in 2025","url":"https://www.superblocks.com/blog/monolithic-vs-microservices"},{"title":"Microservices vs. Monolith: The Best Architecture for Scalability & Growth — Rubyroid Labs","url":"https://rubyroidlabs.com/blog/2025/04/microservices-vs-monolith/"},{"title":"Monolithic vs. Microservices Architecture | IBM","url":"https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/monolithic-vs-microservices"},{"title":"Microservices vs. Modular Monoliths in 2025: When Each Approach Wins - Java Code Geeks","url":"https://www.javacodegeeks.com/2025/12/microservices-vs-modular-monoliths-in-2025-when-each-approach-wins.html"},{"title":"Microservices vs. Monolithic Architecture 2025 : Aalpha","url":"https://www.aalpha.net/articles/microservices-architecture-vs-monolithic-architecture/"},{"title":"Monolithic vs Microservices - Difference Between Software Development Architectures- AWS","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-monolithic-and-microservices-architecture/"}]},"Here's a comprehensive overview of microservices vs. monolith architecture best practices for 2025:\n\n## Key Differences\n\nA monolithic application is built as a single unified unit while a microservices architecture is a collection of smaller, independently deployable services.(no content)Microservices involve building applications as a collection of independent, loosely-coupled services that communicate through APIs.\n\n## When to Choose Monolithic Architecture\n\nFor a new product or startup building an MVP (Minimum Viable Product), a monolith is often the best choice.

It's still \"your\" monorepo; Turborepo just handles running the scripts defined in your package.json.\n\n## Key Differentiators\n\n**Turborepo:**\n- Simple Remote Caching: It integrates natively with Vercel for shared remote caching, which is valuable for CI pipelines.\n- Turborepo gives you an incredibly fast car, but it doesn't give you a map or a seatbelt. It only solves the problem of execution speed. It doesn't help you with architecture. It doesn't stop you from creating circular dependencies, offer generators to create new components consistently, or give you a visualizer.\n\n**Nx:**\n- Nx works with any programming language, framework and tooling. The core of Nx is written in Rust for speed and TypeScript for extensibility, with a first-class plugin API.\n- Nx Cloud goes beyond just locating a shared cache. It allows intelligently distributing tasks across multiple machines without any manual \"binning\" configuration.\n- Nx's documentation is comprehensive and pairs nicely with tools like Nx Console for easier management.\n\n## Scalability\n\nNx works best with large-scale monorepos and enterprise setups, offering features like intelligent task orchestration. Turborepo scales effectively for configurations that prioritize speed and ease of use. Choose Nx for flexibility and depth on sprawling projects, or Turborepo for simplicity that maintains strong performance.\n\n## When to Choose Each\n\n**Choose Turborepo if:**\n- Your main problem is that CI/CD and local builds are slow; you have an existing monorepo and don't want a costly migration; you have a senior, disciplined team that can self-manage architecture; you value minimalism and flexibility over structured guidance.\n\n**Choose Nx if:**\n- You are starting a new project and want a solid structure from day zero; your project is large, complex, and needs long-term maintainability.\n- Your project has diverse tech stacks requiring unmatched flexibility and a mature ecosystem.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nIf you want a simpler tool that's easy to get started with and integrates well with modern JavaScript tooling, choose Turborepo.

It acts as a single entry point, handling all the incoming requests and routing them to the appropriate service. Think of it as the front door to your microservices ecosystem.\n\n## Kong API Gateway\n\nKong is a leading open-source API gateway and microservices management layer that has gained immense popularity due to its robust feature set, high performance, and flexible architecture. Built on top of NGINX and powered by LuaJIT, Kong is designed for maximum scalability and low latency, making it an ideal choice for high-traffic environments and complex microservices deployments.\n\n### Key Features of Kong\n\n- By providing functionality for proxying, routing, load balancing, health checking, authentication (and more), Kong serves as the central layer for orchestrating microservices or conventional API traffic - and agentic LLM and MCP as well - with ease.\n\n- Ultra-lightweight, infinitely scalable NGINX engine with 50K+ transactions per second per node.\n\n- Built for hybrid and multi-cloud, optimized for microservices and distributed architectures.\n\n### Kong Architecture\n\nKong is an open-source, cloud-native API Gateway built on top of Nginx and OpenResty, a high-performance web platform that extends Nginx with Lua scripting capabilities. This foundation provides Kong with exceptional speed, flexibility, and extensibility, making it an ideal choice for organizations grappling with the demands of microservices, serverless functions, and other distributed architectures.\n\n### Use in Microservices\n\nIn a microservices paradigm, where applications are decomposed into small, independent services, Kong acts as the essential front door. It handles API routing, service discovery, and cross-cutting concerns (like authentication and rate limiting) for all microservices. This prevents clients from having to directly interact with numerous backend services, simplifying client-side logic and reducing coupling between clients and specific service implementations.\n\n## Popular API Gateway Tools Comparison\n\nKong is an open-source API gateway that's highly customizable and supports a wide range of plugins for things like authentication, rate limiting, and logging. NGINX is a powerful web server that can also act as an API gateway. It's known for its high performance and reliability.\n\n## 2025 Trends and Benchmarks\n\nAccording to a 2024 CNCF benchmark, Kong achieves 30% higher throughput in Kubernetes environments, tested on AWS EC2 t3.medium instances with 1000 concurrent Python requests. Benchmarking Kong against baselines like NGINX, HAProxy, and AWS API Gateway reveals its edge in 2025 microservices.\n\n### Future Trends\n\nServerless platforms like AWS Lambda are gaining popularity. API gateways that integrate seamlessly with serverless functions will be in high demand. Expect to see more API gateways leveraging AI and machine learning for things like anomaly detection, automated scaling, and predictive analytics. As edge computing becomes more prevalent, API gateways that can operate at the edge will be crucial for low-latency applications.\n\n## Kong Technical Architecture Components\n\nA typical Kong API Gateway architecture consists of the following components: Acts as the entry point for API requests. Handles routing, authentication, rate limiting, logging, and other functionalities. Supports custom plugins written in Lua and Go to extend capabilities. Deployable as a containerized service using Docker or Kubernetes.\n\n### Scalability Features\n\nHorizontal scaling using Kubernetes and Docker Swarm. Load balancing and failover mechanisms. Supports multi-region deployments. Automated failover with HAProxy, Nginx, or cloud-native load balancers.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8eb2af31-ea52-429d-8baf-5a8127f78258","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:14:58.698Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"API gateway pattern Kong NGINX 2025 microservices","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_019jurdm9jFL56ztCoBLpXdm","content":[{"title":"GitHub - Kong/kong: 🦍 The Cloud-Native Gateway for APIs & AI","url":"https://github.com/Kong/kong"},{"title":"API Gateway Config Generator - Kong, NGINX, AWS Gateway | EaseCloud","url":"https://www.easecloud.io/tools/microservices/api-gateway-config-generator/"},{"title":"Kong Gateway: Most Trusted Open Source API Gateway | Kong Inc.","url":"https://konghq.com/products/kong-gateway"},{"title":"API Gateway Patterns with Kong: Routing and Rate Limiting for Python Microservices in 2025","url":"https://johal.in/api-gateway-patterns-with-kong-routing-and-rate-limiting-for-python-microservices-in-2025/"},{"title":"Implementing Kong API Gateway: A Step-by-Step Guide","url":"https://apipark.com/techblog/en/implementing-kong-api-gateway-a-step-by-step-guide/"},{"title":"Unlock the Power of Kong API Gateway: Secure & Scale APIs","url":"https://apipark.com/techblog/en/unlock-the-power-of-kong-api-gateway-secure-scale-apis/"},{"title":"GitHub - anastayaa/Kong-API-Gateway-and-Spring-Boot-Microservices","url":"https://github.com/anastayaa/Kong-API-Gateway-and-Spring-Boot-Microservices"},{"title":"API Gateway Patterns in Microservices: Essential Strategies for 2025","url":"https://toxigon.com/api-gateway-patterns-in-microservices"},{"title":"Kong Gateway | Kong Docs","url":"https://developer.konghq.com/gateway/"},{"title":"Kong API Gateway Architecture Explained – Tech Group","url":"https://techgroup.blog/2025/03/12/sample-kong-api-technical-architecture/"}]},"Here's what I found about API gateway patterns with Kong and NGINX for microservices in 2025:\n\n## Overview of API Gateway Pattern\n\nAn API gateway is a server that sits between your clients (like web apps or mobile apps) and your microservices.

Sentry is a dedicated error tracking and performance monitoring service, while Datadog is a comprehensive monitoring platform that unifies logs, metrics and traces.\n\n### Microservices Architecture\nDatadog typically works better for complex microservices architectures due to its unified monitoring approach and distributed tracing capabilities. However, Sentry can still be valuable for error tracking within individual services.\n\n### Log Management\nDatadog has what it calls \"Logging without Limits\", which ensures that users can cost-effectively collect, store, and analyze log data by decoupling log ingestion from indexing. This feature empowers organizations to capture all relevant log data, regardless of volume or complexity.(no content)Sentry doesn't exactly perform log management. It integrates with your existing application logging infrastructure and enhances it with additional insights without replacing the need for traditional logs. It captures events and stores them in a way that is optimized for error tracking and debugging.\n\n### Distributed Tracing\nIf your app runs across multiple services or involves cloud-based architectures, Datadog is built for complex systems. It provides distributed tracing that tracks how data flows through your services, so you can spot performance issues or bottlenecks across your infrastructure.\n\n## Best Practices for Microservices Monitoring in 2025\n\n### Log Aggregation\nLogging is essential in troubleshooting, but it's not simple in microservices architecture since the logs are distributed among different services, each writing to its own log files. Log aggregation overcomes this problem by consolidating all the logs of all services into a unified logging system like Elasticsearch, Splunk, Datadog, or New Relic. This logging system is responsible for collecting, aggregating, and storing the logs.\n\n### Correlation IDs\nCreate a new correlation ID for every incoming request. This ID should be created during the start of the call or request (in API Gateway or ingress controller) and propagated across all downstream services. Pass the correlation ID through HTTP headers or message metadata to maintain traceability as the request flows through your microservices. Log the correlation ID in every log entry related to that request across all services.\n\n### Service-Level Objectives (SLOs)\nSLOs are predefined targets, often expressed in percentages, that indicate the system's reliability and performance over a specified period. They allow teams to evaluate how well the services meet their goals and lead to user satisfaction. SLOs transform collected telemetry data into actionable targets, bridging the gap between metrics and reliability by defining measurable goals that track what matters most, such as response times, error rates, and availability.\n\n### OpenTelemetry Adoption\nOpenTelemetry is rapidly becoming the industry standard for collecting logs, traces, and metrics in cloud-native environments. Many tools, including Datadog and Sentry, now support OpenTelemetry out-of-the-box.\n\n### Combined Tooling Approach\nCombining Sentry, Datadog, and other logging tools provides comprehensive observability: errors, performance metrics, and custom logs in one unified workflow. As microservices and serverless architectures grow, more teams are adopting platforms that combine logging, tracing, and metrics. This trend pushes developers to centralize monitoring for full-stack visibility.\n\n## When to Choose Each Tool\n\n**Choose Sentry when:**\n- Error tracking and real-time application performance data are critical to your monitoring stack\n- You need an easy-to-implement, developer-friendly solution that integrates effortlessly into your existing development workflow and doesn't require a complex configuration process\n\n**Choose Datadog when:**\n- You are building an observability suite and want a comprehensive out-of-the-box solution\n- You need a full-stack monitoring solution with insights into everything from infrastructure and server metrics to application performance\n\n### Cost Considerations\nSentry is generally more cost-effective for specific error tracking needs since it's open-source and can be self-hosted. Datadog's pricing is based on a broader feature set and can be more expensive, but it provides comprehensive monitoring capabilities.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"121a6899-ad42-4353-a268-0d4997b27eb9","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:15:01.464Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"DataDog Sentry logging monitoring microservices best practices 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01PRAUsV7So62aVpTnraJCSD","content":[{"title":"Datadog vs. Sentry: a side-by-side comparison for 2025 | Better Stack Community","url":"https://betterstack.com/community/comparisons/datadog-vs-sentry/"},{"title":"Sentry vs Datadog [Detailed Comparison 2025] | Uptrace","url":"https://uptrace.dev/comparisons/sentry-vs-datadog"},{"title":"Datadog vs Sentry - Which Monitoring Tool to Choose?

Like other public apps, these desktop clients need PKCE to use the authorization code flow securely.(no content)When public clients (e.g., native and single-page applications) request access tokens, some additional security concerns are posed that are not mitigated by the Authorization Code Flow alone. This is because native apps cannot securely store a Client Secret. Decompiling the app will reveal the Client Secret, which is bound to the app and is the same for all users and devices. They are also vulnerable to authorization code interception and injection attacks.\n\n### How PKCE Works\n\nPKCE works by having the app generate a random value at the beginning of the flow called a Code Verifier. The app hashes the Code Verifier and the result is called the Code Challenge. The app then kicks off the flow in the normal way, except that it includes the Code Challenge in the query string for the request to the Authorization Server. The Authorization Server stores the hashed value (the Code Challenge) for later verification.(no content)The app makes the request to exchange the code for tokens, only it sends the Code Verifier instead of a fixed secret. Now the Authorization Server can hash the Code Verifier and compare it to the hashed value it stored earlier. This is an effective, dynamic stand-in for a fixed secret. Assuming the hashed value matches, the Authorization Server will return the tokens.\n\n### PKCE Flow Steps\n\nAt a high level, the flow has the following steps: Your application (app) generates a code verifier followed by a code challenge. Your app requests an authorization code from the authorization server. The request contains the generated code challenge.(no content)The SDK sends this code and the code_verifier to the Authorization Server (/oauth/token endpoint). The Authorization Server verifies the code_challenge and code_verifier. The Authorization Server responds with an ID token and access token (and optionally, a refresh token). Your application can use the access token to call an API to access information about the user. The API responds with requested data.\n\n### 2025 Best Practices and OAuth 2.1\n\nOAuth 2.0 best practices recommend PKCE be used for every client, not just public ones. OAuth 2.1, despite being in its draft stage, has already been adopted by many organizations. It makes PKCE mandatory.(no content)As OAuth 2.1 becomes the standard, PKCE will transition from a recommendation to a requirement. Implementing it now ensures your authentication flows are secure and future-proof.(no content)The OAuth 2.0 Security Best Current Practice, a document published by IETF as RFC 9126 addresses vulnerabilities in the original OAuth 2.0 specifications and suggests improved mechanisms to strengthen security. One of the key recommendations is to use PKCE for all OAuth clients, including confidential clients, to protect against code interception attacks. The use of the authorization code flow with PKCE is now suggested as the default method for all client types.\n\n### Microsoft Identity Platform Support\n\nMicrosoft explicitly recommends using PKCE for public clients (such as desktop/mobile applications) and also supports: Personal accounts (@outlook.com, @hotmail.com, etc.) and Enterprise accounts (OneDrive for Business/Work or School account).\n\n### Code Challenge Methods\n\nThe S256 method is the recommended and most secure method. Always use this unless the client cannot perform SHA-256 hashing.(no content)The code_verifier is a random URL-safe string with a minimum length of 43 characters. The code_challenge is a Base64-encoded SHA-256 hash of the code_verifier.\n\n### Key Takeaways\n\nUse PKCE for all public clients: Mobile apps, SPAs, desktop apps, and CLI tools must use PKCE.(no content)The Authorization Code flow with PKCE is the recommended method for controlling the access between your platform-specific apps and a resource server.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"854cbcb3-b77c-4e9c-a526-b00f7eaa966e","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:15:02.861Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"OAuth 2.0 PKCE desktop application authentication flow 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01XLQQCZMCrUXSDmqK217dBE","content":[{"title":"Microsoft identity platform and OAuth 2.0 authorization code flow - Microsoft identity platform | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity-platform/v2-oauth2-auth-code-flow"},{"title":"OAuth 2.0 Authorization Code Flow with PKCE - Microsoft Q&A","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/4729102/oauth-2-0-authorization-code-flow-with-pkce"},{"title":"Authorization Code Flow with Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)","url":"https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce"},{"title":"PKCE for OAuth 2.0","url":"https://oauth.net/2/pkce/"},{"title":"What is PKCE?

If you need to send binary data - you're out of luck.\n- WebSockets can transmit binary data and UTF-8, meaning that apps can support sending plain text and binary formats such as images and video.\n\n### Reconnection\n- In case of lost connection, SSE will auto-reconnect which is a helpful feature.\n- When a WebSocket connection is closed (e.g., due to network issues), the client does not try to reconnect to the server, which means you'll need to write extra code to poll the server, re-establishing the connection.\n\n### Implementation Complexity\n- SSE is simple to implement using standard HTTP, has built-in reconnection and event ID tracking, and works well with existing HTTP infrastructure and is firewall-friendly.\n- WebSocket is more complex to set up and maintain, requires a specialized WebSocket server, and firewall and proxy compatibility issues can arise.\n\n## Performance\n\nTests didn't show much of a performance difference between SSE and WebSocket across scenarios.(no content)Given the relative parity in performance, users should focus on the functional requirements when selecting.(no content)WebSocket typically offers lower latency due to its persistent connection, making it ideal for applications requiring fast, real-time interactions. SSE, while it has slightly higher latency due to HTTP overhead, is generally sufficient for most applications that require server-to-client updates.\n\n## Use Cases\n\n### When to Use WebSocket\n- Online Gaming: Real-time interactions and low latency are crucial.\n- Live Chat Applications: Bi-directional communication enables seamless messaging. Collaborative Editing: Real-time document updates with minimal delay.\n- WebSockets are preferable for use cases such as multiplayer collaboration and chat apps.\n\n### When to Use SSE\n- Server-Sent Events is a good alternative to WebSockets for simple realtime use cases that only require one-way communication (from server to client). Examples include read-only realtime apps like stock tickers, or news updates.\n- Live News Feeds: Continuous updates from the server without frequent client requests. Social Media Feeds: Streaming updates and notifications to users. Monitoring Dashboards: Real-time data visualization where updates are pushed from the server.\n\n## Limitations\n\n### SSE Limitations\n- Browsers cap the number of simultaneous SSE connections to six per client. This limitation becomes problematic when multiple tabs require active SSE connections.\n- One of the main limitations of SSE in the early stages was the connection cap imposed by HTTP/1.1. But with the introduction of HTTP/2, this limitation was removed. HTTP/2 allows multiple data streams to flow over a single connection through multiplexing.\n\n### WebSocket Limitations\n- Some enterprise firewalls with packet inspection have trouble dealing with WebSockets (notably SophosXG Firewall, WatchGuard, and McAfee Web Gateway).\n- WebSocket maintains a persistent connection, which can be more demanding on server resources.\n\n## 2025 Recommendations\n\nReal-time data is everywhere in 2025 — whether you're building stock dashboards, multiplayer games, or live chat apps.(no content)Don't just default to WebSockets — sometimes SSE is better for one-way updates.(no content)The choice often comes down to your specific requirements: if you only need server push with reliability, SSE is likely the better choice.

GitHub Actions allows you to define workflows that trigger on changes to specific paths. This configuration ensures that workflows only run when changes occur in the specified directories, conserving resources and speeding up the CI process.\n\n### 2. **Matrix Builds for Parallelization**\nUse matrix builds to parallelize testing across services or packages, and reusable workflows to avoid duplication across services.\n\n### 3. **Reusable Workflows**\nOrganize workflows: Keep your workflows organized and modular to manage complexity as your monorepo grows.\n\n### 4. **Smart Caching**\nCache dependencies smartly to speed up builds. Use environments + secrets to manage staging vs. production safely. This setup keeps CI/CD fast, modular, and easier to maintain.\n\n### 5. **Using NX or Similar Tools for Change Detection**\nNX provides powerful CLI tools to detect changes, build, and deploy only what's needed. GitHub Actions brings a flexible and developer-friendly CI/CD environment directly inside your repo. Combining the two allows reduced build time by targeting only affected apps.(no content)This job identifies only the apps or services in the NX monorepo that were modified in the current commit. The nx show projects --base command compares the current commit with its predecessor and fetches affected projects. The result is converted into a JSON matrix format that GitHub Actions can use to process each affected app in parallel.\n\n### 6. **Proper Git Fetch Depth for Change Detection**\nTo obtain the differences from the previous commit using git diff HEAD~, you need to set the fetch-depth to 2. If this is not set, the previous commit cannot be fetched, and you will not be able to perform a diff comparison. This precaution is essential because the default behavior of actions/checkout@v3 is to fetch only the latest commit (i.e., with a fetch-depth of 1). This shallow fetch is faster as it downloads less history, but it's not suitable for workflows that need to compare changes between commits.\n\n### 7. **Scope Workflows to Sub-directories**\nThe most important part is how each GitHub Actions workflow is scoped to the sub-directory for each sub-project in the monorepo. This is what allows each microservice in the monorepo to have its own separate CD pipeline. You can add as many microservices to this monorepo as you like, but they all need their own workflow configuration that is scoped to their subdirectory in the monorepo.\n\n### 8. **Environment-Aware Deployments**\nThis step defines the image tag and ECS cluster name based on the GitHub branch name. For example, development → image_tag=dev, cluster_name=dev-cluster, and testing → image_tag=test, cluster_name=test-cluster. This enables environment-specific deployments.\n\n### 9. **Handle Directory Dependencies**\nConsider how directory dependencies affect your workflows. If one directory relies on another, your workflow should reflect these dependencies to ensure consistent builds. By following these practices, you can create a CI/CD pipeline that is both efficient and robust, capable of handling the specific needs of a monorepo structure with GitHub Actions.\n\n### 10. **Workflow Templates for Scalability**\nWhile in cases with a simple setup duplicating the workflow seems a reasonable approach, in case of a big application with a complex workflow and a large number of routes this becomes problematic. Instead, it would be better to automatically generate workflows from a single workflow template.\n\nThese practices help ensure your monorepo CI/CD pipelines remain fast, efficient, and maintainable as your codebase grows.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"7e2abe9f-5635-4612-8707-87c20a83fa76","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:15:37.279Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"GitHub Actions CI/CD monorepo 2025 best practices deployment","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_015HKUt7QUFM9KuGhZWgtTzC","content":[{"title":"What are the best practices for organizing large monorepos using GitHub Actions for CI/CD? · community · Discussion #158727","url":"https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/158727"},{"title":"Monorepo with GitHub Actions","url":"https://graphite.com/guides/monorepo-with-github-actions"},{"title":"Monorepo Mayhem?

This allows an upload without requiring another party to have AWS security credentials or permissions.(no content)A presigned URL is a temporary signed link that gives limited access to an S3 object. You can use it for uploads, downloads, or deletions without needing to expose AWS access keys.\n\n### Key Architecture Components\n\n**Basic Flow:**\nYou can use an AWS Lambda function to generate S3 presigned URLs, fronted by an AWS API Gateway. The architecture illustrates flows for uploading a file via an S3 presigned URL: Get the S3 presigned URL, then upload the file to S3 via a presigned URL.\n\n**Serverless Architecture Considerations:**\nIf you are using a serverless architecture with API Gateway and Lambda, implementing upload and download functionalities gets even more complicated because you are constrained by strict payload size limits (Lambda request/response payloads are both limited to 6 MB) and time limits (API Gateway will timeout after 29 seconds).\n\n### Modern Architecture Pattern (2025)\n\nUploading files to S3 via pre-signed POST URLs allows clients to upload securely and efficiently without routing large payloads through your backend. You can enforce upload rules like file size and required metadata using S3 form conditions.(no content)A Lambda trigger processes the file after upload — extracting metadata and saving records to a database. This approach offloads heavy lifting to AWS, improves scalability, and keeps your architecture clean — but requires handling async workflow.\n\n**Combining AWS Features:**\nTo solve both the performance and reliability problems, we can rethink the flow by combining several AWS features — presigned URLs, S3 event notifications, and AWS Lambda.\n\n### Large File Uploads with Multipart\n\nCombining S3 Pre-Signed URLs with Multipart Uploads radically improves both the efficiency and the user experience of handling large file uploads.(no content)You can offload heavy file processing to a separate thread on the client side, keeping your main UI buttery smooth. Because the heavy lifting relies on the massive, resilient power of AWS S3 instead of your own backend bandwidth, applications are scaled and ready.\n\n### URL Expiration\n\nIf you create a presigned URL with the Amazon S3 console, the expiration time can be set between 1 minute and 12 hours. If you use the AWS CLI or AWS SDKs, the expiration time can be set as high as 7 days.(no content)For security reasons, the expiration time should be as short as possible, to reduce the risk of unauthorised access to our resources.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\nThe credentials used by the presigned URL are those of the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) principal who generated the URL.(no content)Treat presigned URLs as bearer tokens. Anyone with the URL can perform the specified operation until it expires. Share presigned URLs only with intended recipients and consider using short expiration times for sensitive operations.\n\n### Integrity Verification\n\nPresigned URLs created with AWS Signature Version 4 support additional checksum algorithms including CRC-64/NVME, CRC32, CRC32C, SHA-1, and SHA-256. To use these additional checksum algorithms, ensure you're using AWS Signature Version 4 and include the appropriate checksum header in your upload request.\n\n### Trade-offs to Consider\n\nSince the upload goes directly to S3, your backend only sees the file after it lands. You can enforce structure (e.g. content type, size, custom metadata) at upload time via presigned policy conditions, but you can't inspect or reject the file contents in advance.(no content)AWS S3 presigned URLs offer a way to directly upload files in a more scalable, efficient, and easy way when compared to using a server upload proxy. It can help lower operation costs by reducing the bandwidth and processing load on the servers, and, thus, increasing scalability since they don't need to deal with the file upload traffic. At the same time, it lowers the file upload request latency and allows the upload of large files by bypassing the middleware server's request payloads limits.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ec0aaa7f-175a-4157-b697-4fe80c85b904","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:15:39.116Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"S3 presigned URL file upload architecture 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01QwouBSHDbMEvoquQFndeFP","content":[{"title":"Download and upload objects with presigned URLs - Amazon Simple Storage Service","url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-presigned-url.html"},{"title":"Presigned URLs · Cloudflare R2 docs","url":"https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/api/s3/presigned-urls/"},{"title":"The Architecture That Lets Us Sleep: Scalable Uploads with S3 presigned URLs - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/oliverke/the-architecture-that-lets-us-sleep-scalable-uploads-with-s3-presigned-urls-1jf3"},{"title":"Uploading objects with presigned URLs - Amazon Simple Storage Service","url":"https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/PresignedUrlUploadObject.html"},{"title":"Efficient S3 File Upload Pipeline with Presigned URLs, Event Triggers, and Lambda Processing | Bright Inventions","url":"https://brightinventions.pl/blog/efficient-S3-file-uploads-with-async-processing/"},{"title":"Efficient S3 File Upload Pipeline with Presigned URLs, Event Triggers, and Lambda Processing | by Kuba Sułkowski | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@kubasukowski/efficient-s3-file-upload-pipeline-with-presigned-urls-event-triggers-and-lambda-processing-49811c276c46"},{"title":"S3: Presigned URL upload with tags","url":"https://pabis.eu/blog/2025-05-02-Tag-S3-Objects-Presigned-URL-Upload.html"},{"title":"File upload with Amazon S3 presigned URLs","url":"https://www.alter-solutions.com/articles/file-upload-amazon-s3-url"},{"title":"The illustrated guide to S3 pre-signed URLs - fourTheorem","url":"https://fourtheorem.com/the-illustrated-guide-to-s3-pre-signed-urls/"},{"title":"How I Built a Secure File Upload API Using FastAPI and AWS S3 Presigned URLs - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/copubah/how-i-built-a-secure-file-upload-api-using-fastapi-and-aws-s3-presigned-urls-7eg"}]},"Here are the search results for \"S3 presigned URL file upload architecture 2025\":\n\n## Overview of S3 Presigned URL File Upload Architecture\n\n### What Are Presigned URLs?\n\nYou can use presigned URLs to grant time-limited access to objects in Amazon S3 without updating your bucket policy.(no content)You can also use presigned URLs to allow someone to upload a specific object to your Amazon S3 bucket.

CEP 12 will be the last major update to CEP, although critical security issues will continue to be addressed.(no content)The Common Extensibility Platform has been the method of choice for plugin developers who needed anything beyond the simplest of user interfaces. While it's still going to be around in Photoshop for some time, it will at some point be deprecated and then, eventually, removed from Photoshop.\n\n### CEP Architecture Limitations\n\nCEP uses a full version of Chromium as a web host. This is very resource intensive for the host application, even more so since each CEP plugin runs in its own instance of Chromium. CEP doesn't talk directly to the host application, but requires that host scripts be written in ExtendScript, and passed to the app via EvalScript calls.\n\n### UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform) Updates\n\nAdobe recently released UXP v8.0 in Photoshop 2025 (v26) and InDesign v20.0 with key features including support for new Spectrum Web Components and the much-awaited local HTML support for Webview. Webviews are particularly helpful for features that are not innately supported in UXP, such as animation, 3D APIs, etc. By allowing local HTML files, they are reducing the overhead of hosting HTML files in a remote server.(no content)UXP now includes the ability to record a function call inside a UXP plugin as an Action step, and allows access to Photoshop C++ SDK from UXP Hybrid Plugins.\n\n### UXP in Premiere Pro\n\nUXP in Premiere Pro has been in a private beta phase for a few months now. If you need access to the pre-release, you can reach out to ppro-uxp-extensibility@adobe.com. The public beta was expected to launch in early December, allowing developers to obtain the Premiere Pro beta and the latest version of UXP Developer Tool (UDT) from Creative Cloud Desktop app.\n\n### Illustrator 2025 Situation\n\nAccording to Adobe community discussions, Adobe support confirmed that since Illustrator 2022, CEP is no longer supported in some capacity. However, there's no official documentation about an alternative like UXP for Illustrator yet. This has left some developers at a dead end unless they use the Plugin SDK (C++), which isn't suitable for UI-based panels like CEP was.\n\n### EU Compliance Requirements for 2025\n\nDevelopers must provide trader details by February 16, 2025, to keep their plugin visible and available for users in the European Union as of February 17, 2025. This trader information will be displayed publicly on listing detail pages when viewed from EU countries.\n\n### Development Resources\n\nCEP 12 is available for developing extensions and add-ons in latest versions of Creative Cloud Applications. The SDK provides the low-level tools that you need to build extensions. Extensions built using these tools must be packaged as ZXP files in order to be seen and loaded by Extension Manager.(no content)Adobe's UXP Developer Tool is a command-line interface (CLI) and graphical interface for building modern plug-ins. It simplifies the process of creating, testing, and deploying UXP-based extensions.\n\nNote: The search results didn't contain specific information about authentication mechanisms for CEP/UXP plugins. If you need details specifically about authentication implementation in these extensions, I can perform another search focused on that topic.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8f1065fa-3c85-4215-9e7f-36614c976166","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:15:40.140Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe CEP UXP plugin authentication extension 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01He3ng75b8rsXwDyxpgYP6K","content":[{"title":"UXP for CEP Developers","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_for_you/uxp_for_cep_devs/"},{"title":"Using web technologies to build Adobe extensions | Theodo","url":"https://blog.theodo.com/2025/building-adobe-extensions/"},{"title":"Updates for Creative Cloud Desktop Extensibility | by Padma Krishnamoorthy | Adobe Tech Blog | Medium","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/updates-for-creative-cloud-desktop-extensibility-0dd5c663563e"},{"title":"Submission and Review - Overview","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/creative-cloud/docs/guides/submission/overview"},{"title":"How to Create Extensions in Illustrator 2025 Without CEP?","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/illustrator-discussions/how-to-create-extensions-in-illustrator-2025-without-cep/td-p/15179876"},{"title":"Enabling CEP extensions while working in Audition","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/audition/using/enabling-cep-extensions.html"},{"title":"GitHub - Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources: Tools and documentation for building Creative Cloud app extensions with CEP","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources"},{"title":"Unlocking Creativity: Developing Plug-Ins for Adobe Illustrator Using CEP and UXP","url":"https://metadesignsolutions.com/unlocking-creativity-developing-plug-ins-for-adobe-illustrator-using-cep-and-uxp/"},{"title":"how to install the CEP extension properly · Issue #47 · Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/issues/47"},{"title":"Building Adobe Extensions — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/building-adobe-extensions/"}]},"Here are the search results for \"Adobe CEP UXP plugin authentication extension 2025\":\n\n## Adobe CEP and UXP Plugin Extension Updates for 2025\n\n### CEP (Common Extensibility Platform) Status\n\nCEP 12 shipped with Photoshop 25.12, Premiere Pro 25.0, and After Effects 25.0.
