Under the hood, this is a zip file.(no content)Before you package your plugin for distribution outside your own computer, make sure you've obtained a valid ID from the Developer Distribution portal. Without an ID (which goes in the id field of your plugin's manifest.json file), you won't be able to distribute your plugin in the Creative Cloud Marketplace.(no content)Using the UXP Developer Tool, choose Package from the Actions menu (the ellipsis on the right side of the Developer Tool window, on the same line as your plugin name). This shows a \"Select target directory\" dialog where you choose where your built plugin .ccx file should reside.\n\n### Distribution Options\nYou can build a plugin just for yourself, your friends, or your employer, or distribute through the Creative Cloud Plugin Marketplace on millions of desktops.\n\n### Installation Methods\nUXP plugins are commonly installed directly by the Creative Cloud Desktop application. The installation options are slightly different depending on the distribution channel you are using—whether you are installing a plugin directly from the Creative Cloud Marketplace, a .ccx installer file obtained from independent channels, or deploying it in an enterprise environment.\n\n### Enterprise Distribution\nThere are two primary ways to deploy UXP plugins at scale: Via the Admin Console with Creative Cloud Marketplace integration, or by adding plugins directly to your deployment packages or making them available for self-service installation.(no content)The UPIA tool allows administrators to deploy plugins anytime from the command line. For offline use, in environments with limited internet access or under Adobe's Feature Restricted Licensing, it is still possible to install and use UXP plugins using .ccx files and the UPIA tool.\n\n### UXP Developer Tool (UDT)\nThe UXP Developer Tool (UDT) simplifies the process of creating, loading, managing, and debugging plugins for Adobe's UXP-powered applications. UXP plugins are supported in Premiere v25.6 and later since UDT v2.2.(no content)UDT lets you package plugins into a .ccx installable file, ready for distribution, and provides Starter Templates and Sample Projects to help you get moving faster.\n\n### Recent Updates (2024-2025)\nAdobe recently released UXP v8.0 in Photoshop 2025 (v26) and InDesign v20.0 with key features including support for new Spectrum Web Components and local HTML support for Webview. Webviews allow for features not innately supported in UXP, such as animation and 3D APIs, and local HTML files reduce the overhead of hosting files on a remote server.\n\n### Important Notice for XD Plugins\nOn November 15th, 2024, Adobe stopped accepting new plugins for Adobe XD in the Marketplace.(no content)Existing published plugins can continue to be managed and updated via the Developer Distribution portal. The UXP Developer Tool (UDT) will continue to support plugin development.\n\n### Key Documentation Resources:\n- **Photoshop UXP**: https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/\n- **Premiere Pro UXP**: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/\n- **Enterprise Distribution**: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/enterprise-distribution/\n- **XD UXP**: https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a025508a-03d8-4a41-aac7-ec8fa9b5837f","timestamp":"2025-12-16T17:17:09.354Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP Plugin deployment distribution official documentation 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_012vDPaDGyUGKTLxobFjan87","content":[{"title":"Adobe","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/uxp/"},{"title":"Enterprise Distribution","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/enterprise-distribution/"},{"title":"Documentation-UXP for Adobe Photoshop","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/"},{"title":"Documentation-Adobe XD","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp"},{"title":"Install a UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/install/"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop: Documentation for UXP Plugin API - Adobe Photoshop 2022 - apiVersion 2","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop"},{"title":"Packaging Your Plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/distribution/packaging-your-plugin/"},{"title":"Share and publish your Photoshop UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/distribution/"},{"title":"Essential Development Tools for UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/"},{"title":"Updates for Creative Cloud Desktop Extensibility | by Padma Krishnamoorthy | Adobe Tech Blog | Medium","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/updates-for-creative-cloud-desktop-extensibility-0dd5c663563e"}]},"Based on my search, here's the official Adobe documentation information for UXP Plugin deployment and distribution:\n\n## Adobe UXP Plugin Deployment & Distribution Documentation\n\n### Packaging Plugins\nUXP plugins for Photoshop are distributed in the form of a .ccx file.

For all officially supported runtimes, the only requirement is to create an API directory at the root of your project directory, placing your Vercel functions inside.\n- Because Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) uses Vercel functions, the same configurations apply. The ISR route can be defined using a glob pattern, and accepts the same properties as when using Vercel functions.\n\n**Headers and Routing:**\n- You can configure custom response headers for static files, Vercel functions, and a wildcard that matches all routes.\n- Vercel recommends using cleanUrls, trailingSlash, redirects, rewrites, and/or headers instead of legacy routing options.\n\n**Build Configuration:**\n- The ignoreBuildStep value overrides the Ignored Build Step in Project Settings.\n- When the command exits with code 1, the build will continue.

For all officially supported runtimes, the only requirement is to create an API directory at the root of your project directory, placing your Vercel functions inside.\n- Because Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) uses Vercel functions, the same configurations apply. The ISR route can be defined using a glob pattern, and accepts the same properties as when using Vercel functions.\n\n**Headers and Routing:**\n- You can configure custom response headers for static files, Vercel functions, and a wildcard that matches all routes.\n- Vercel recommends using cleanUrls, trailingSlash, redirects, rewrites, and/or headers instead of legacy routing options.\n\n**Build Configuration:**\n- The ignoreBuildStep value overrides the Ignored Build Step in Project Settings.\n- When the command exits with code 1, the build will continue. When the command exits with 0, the build is ignored.\n- The installCommand value overrides the Install Command in Project Settings.\n\n**Git Configuration:**\n- You can specify branches that should not trigger a deployment upon commits. By default, any unspecified branch is set to deploy. Use minimatch syntax to define behavior for multiple branches.\n\n### Project Settings\n\nIn your build and deployment settings, you can adjust configurations such as framework settings, code directory, and Node.js version.(no content)You can configure the default settings for your Vercel Functions, including the Node.js version, memory, timeout, region, and more.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\n- **Build Output Configuration**: [vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/configuration)\n- **Git Settings**: [vercel.com/docs/project-configuration/git-settings](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration/git-settings)\n- **Configuring a Build**: [vercel.com/docs/builds/configure-a-build](https://vercel.com/docs/builds/configure-a-build) - Vercel automatically configures the build settings for many front-end frameworks, but you can also customize the build according to your requirements."],"durationSeconds":21.998216875}}

The `--cwd` option can be used to provide a working directory (that can be different from the current directory) when running CLI commands. This option can be a relative or absolute path.(no content)The `--debug` option (shorthand `-d`) can be used to provide a more verbose output when running CLI commands.(no content)You can use the `--confirm` option to skip setup questions.\n\n### Building and Deploying\n\nYou can build your application locally (or in a pipeline) without giving Vercel access to the source code through `vercel build`. Vercel automatically detects your frontend framework and generates a `.vercel/output` folder conforming to the Build Output API specification.(no content)`vercel build` allows you to build your project within your own CI setup and upload only those build artifacts (and not the source code) to Vercel to create a deployment.\n\n### Recent Changes to CLI Login\n\nThe `vercel login` command now uses the industry-standard OAuth 2.0 Device Flow, making authentication more secure and intuitive. You can sign in from any browser-capable device.(no content)Email-based login (`vercel login your@email.com`) and flags such as `--github`, `--gitlab`, `--bitbucket`, `--oob`, and `team` are deprecated. Beginning February 1, 2026, these methods will no longer be supported.\n\nFor the complete and official list of all deploy command flags, I recommend checking the official Vercel documentation at https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy."],"durationSeconds":16.958913417000005}}

To do this, you'll create a vercel.sh file in your repository that your Build Command uses to run conditional logic.(no content)You can use conditional logic like `if [[ $VERCEL_ENV == \"production\" ]]` to run a script according to the environment.

Use **UXP Developer Tool (UDT)** to package:\n   - Open UXP Developer Tool\n   - Click ••• menu → Select \"Package\"\n   - Choose output folder\n   - Generated file: `{plugin-id}_{target-app}.ccx`\n\n**Distribution Options:**\n- Creative Cloud Marketplace (broadest reach)\n- Independent distribution (direct .ccx file sharing)\n- Enterprise deployment via Admin Console + UPIA tool\n- Self-service installation\n\n**Key Constraint:**\n- Each .ccx file targets **ONE host application only** (Photoshop, Premiere Pro, InDesign, etc.)\n\n### Official Documentation\n- [Photoshop UXP Packaging Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/distribution/packaging-your-plugin/)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP Packaging](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/package/)\n- [UXP Developer Tool Docs](https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/)\n\n### 2025 Updates\n- UXP v8.0 released with Photoshop 2025 (v26)\n- Support for Spectrum Web Components\n- Local HTML support in Webviews\n- Premiere Pro UXP supported from v25.6+ with UDT v2.2+\n- Note: Adobe XD plugin submissions closed Nov 15, 2024 (existing plugins can be updated)\n\n---\n\n## VERCEL CONFIGURATION (If You Need Web Hosting Later)\n\nIf you need separate web components alongside your plugin, here's the 2025 setup:\n\n### vercel.json Configuration Format\n\n**Basic Structure:**\n```json\n{\n  \"version\": 2,\n  \"buildCommand\": \"npm run build\",\n  \"installCommand\": \"npm install\",\n  \"env\": {\n    \"MY_KEY\": \"value\",\n    \"SECRET\": \"@secret-name\"\n  },\n  \"functions\": {\n    \"api/**.js\": {\n      \"memory\": 1024,\n      \"maxDuration\": 30\n    }\n  },\n  \"routes\": [\n    { \"src\": \"/api/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"/api/$1\" },\n    { \"src\": \"/(.*)\", \"dest\": \"/index.html\" }\n  ],\n  \"headers\": [\n    {\n      \"source\": \"/(.*)\",\n      \"headers\": [\n        { \"key\": \"Cache-Control\", \"value\": \"public, max-age=3600\" }\n      ]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"redirects\": [\n    { \"source\": \"/old-path\", \"destination\": \"/new-path\", \"permanent\": true }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Environment Variables Best Practice (2025)\n\n**DEPRECATED:** Legacy `env` and `build.env` in vercel.json  \n**RECOMMENDED:** Use Vercel Dashboard UI for all environment variables\n\nThrough Dashboard:\n- Project Settings → Environment Variables\n- Set per-environment: Development, Preview, Production\n- Access in build: All environment variables\n- Access in functions: Use `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix for client-side (Next.js)\n\n**CLI Approach (if needed):**\n```bash\nvercel env add MY_VARIABLE value\n```\n\n### Latest CLI Commands (2025)\n\n**Deploy:**\n```bash\n# Development preview\nvercel\n\n# Production deployment\nvercel --prod\n\n# Skip setup questions\nvercel --prod --confirm\n\n# Deploy prebuilt files only (no rebuild)\nvercel --prebuilt --prod\n\n# Different working directory\nvercel --cwd /path/to/project\n```\n\n**Build Locally:**\n```bash\n# Build without deploying (generates .vercel/output)\nvercel build\n\n# Build with production environment variables\nvercel build --prod\n\n# Build with debug output\nvercel build --debug\n```\n\n**Important CLI Change (Effective Feb 1, 2026):**\n- Old methods deprecated: `vercel login your@email.com`, `--github`, `--gitlab` flags\n- New standard: OAuth 2.0 Device Flow\n- Command: `vercel login` (browser-based)\n\n### Key Configuration Options\n\n| Option | Purpose | 2025 Status |\n|--------|---------|------------|\n| `functions` | Configure Vercel Functions (memory, timeout, region) | Current |\n| `routes` | Custom routing and rewrites | Current |\n| `redirects` | URL redirects | Current |\n| `headers` | Custom response headers | Current |\n| `ignoreBuildStep` | Skip build on certain conditions | Current |\n| `installCommand` | Override package manager command | Current |\n| `env` in vercel.json | Legacy - **DO NOT USE** | Deprecated |\n| `build.env` in vercel.json | Legacy - **DO NOT USE** | Deprecated |\n\n### Official Documentation URLs\n- [Vercel Project Configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration)\n- [Vercel CLI Deploy](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy)\n- [Vercel CLI Build](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/build)\n- [Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables)\n- [Build Output API](https://vercel.com/docs/build-output-api/configuration)\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\nFor your Adobe UXP Plugin project, **focus on the Adobe UXP packaging workflow** using the UXP Developer Tool. Vercel deployment is not relevant unless you're building a companion web application (e.g., a dashboard or documentation site separate from the plugin itself).\n\nSources:\n- [Adobe Photoshop UXP Packaging](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/distribution/packaging-your-plugin/)\n- [Adobe Premiere Pro UXP Distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/)\n- [Vercel Project Configuration](https://vercel.com/docs/project-configuration)\n- [Vercel CLI Deploy](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/deploy)\n- [Vercel CLI Build](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/build)\n- [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/environment-variables)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1860,"cache_read_input_tokens":18882,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1860,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWAkGUzqPsnFHJfEmXaQm","type":"assistant","uuid":"e5e5db7f-9ff0-4b72-bd91-4ded88f75314","timestamp":"2025-12-16T17:18:17.418Z"}
