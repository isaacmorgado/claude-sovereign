If you don't have a plugin project yet, check out the Plugin initialization section for how to bootstrap a plugin from the command line.\n\n### Key CLI Commands\n\nThe UXP developer tools commands include:\n1. Plugin initialization\n2. Plugin loading\n3. Plugin reloading\n4. Plugin debug and self-hosted CDT\n5. Plugin logs\n6. Host discovery command\n7. Foundation commands for enabling/disabling and starting devtools service\n\n### Starting the Service\n\nFor the UXP CLI and Adobe apps to communicate, you must start the CLI service from the command line. This runs a server at an optionally specified port:\n`$ uxp service start [--port <port>]`\nOptions: --port: The port is where the service will run, defaults to 14001\n\n### Plugin Testing\n\nA command is available for plugin developers to run automated UI tests on UXP Plugins - `uxp plugin test`. The tests can be written using standard web automation frameworks like WebDriverIO and UDT CLI gives you a way to run these in an Adobe App.\n\n### Test Automation Setup\n\nThe initial automation setup can be done using a command which will create a folder named \"uxp-plugin-tests\" and install the required dependencies to execute the testsuite.

It allows you to manage plugins that you are developing for Photoshop (and other UXP-powered host applications). This tool makes it easy to create plugins based on templates, and also load and debug plugins that you're building.\n\n### Creating a Plugin via the GUI\n\nYou can either create the plugin folder structure and files from scratch and click the blue Add Plugin button in the Tool, or you can click the Create Plugin button to have it created for you, wizard-style.(no content)You can, of course, create a plugin manually -- but using a template can be the fastest way to get started. To create a plugin from the Developer Tool, follow these steps: Click *Create Plugin.... A \"Create Plugin\" dialog appears. Supply a plugin name in the Plugin Name field.(no content)To do so, open the UXP Developer Tool and click Create Plugin. This opens a dialog where you can enter the details for your plugin. Then click Select Folder and choose a location on your machine where you want to create the plugin.\n\n### CLI Environment Requirements\n\nIf you're using the UXP CLI, you'll need a command-line environment. The Terminal app in macOS works fine, as does the Windows Command Prompt. VS Code has a built-in terminal window which is convenient. And there are a dozen other command-line interpreters on both platforms, including Windows PowerShell.\n\n### Debugging with CLI\n\nIf you've loaded your plugin using the command-line tools, you can use Chrome DevTools: In a new Chrome window, navigate to chrome://inspect. Press Configure... next to Discover network targets checkbox, and add localhost:xxxx (where \"xxxx\" is the port you declared in your debug.json file). When the extension is loaded, it should show up with its ID on this page.\n\n### Installation Note\n\nThe Adobe UXP Developer Tool requires elevated privileges in order to function correctly. If your administrator does not enable your ability to elevate to Administrator privileges, you'll be unable to use this tool.(no content)Install UDT by clicking here or by following these steps: Launch Adobe Creative Cloud Application. If not installed, download and install Creative Cloud. Sign in with your Adobe account if not already signed in. Click on All apps section, and you should see \"UXP Developer Tools\" listed. Click on the Install button for the UXP Developer Tools card to start the installation.\n\nThe search results primarily describe using the **GUI-based** \"Create Plugin\" button in the UXP Developer Tool rather than a specific CLI command for creating plugins. The CLI tools mentioned are mainly related to loading plugins and debugging rather than initial plugin creation.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"7994291e-8ef1-4df3-9fd0-8d6846be48e3","timestamp":"2025-12-16T17:17:41.305Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"site:developer.adobe.com UXP DevTools CLI create plugin command","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01NZ3btNewBBAEc3zUinS8CH","content":[{"title":"The UXP Toolchain","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/uxp-toolchain/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP Developer Tool","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/devtool/"},{"title":"Get started - UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/plugins/getting-started/"},{"title":"UXP developer tools","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/"},{"title":"How to Install UXP Plugins Using Command Line Tools","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/how-to-install-uxp-plugins-using-command-line-tools-a6a62ca4cb1a"},{"title":"UXP Developer Tool (UDT) Walkthrough guide","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/devtool/udt-walkthrough/"},{"title":"UXP Toolchain","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2021/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-toolchain/"},{"title":"Adobe","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2021/devtool/plugin-management/"},{"title":"Installation","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/devtool/installation/"},{"title":"Debugging UXP Plugins","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/debugging/"}]},"Based on my search results from Adobe's developer documentation, here's what I found about UXP DevTools and creating plugins:\n\n## UXP Developer Tool - Create Plugin Command\n\nThe Adobe UXP Developer Tool makes it easy to create, load, debug, and package UXP-based plugins.

When you run this command:\n- On prompt, you provide plugin details such as plugin name, plugin version, and id\n- Select host app (based on host app, a default template for the corresponding host app will be selected)\n- If both host apps are selected (XD, PS), a common template for host apps is selected\n\nOn initialization, the plugin directory structure is created in the current working directory which comprises of manifest.json and plugin source files.\n\n## Related CLI Commands\n\nThe UXP DevTools CLI provides several other commands with flags/options:\n\n### Service Start\n`$ uxp service start [--port <port>]`\nOptions:\n- `--port`: The port where the service will run, defaults to 14001\n\n### Plugin Load\nThe path to the plugin's manifest.json file. If the final plugin code is generated in a sub-folder (say, a \"build\" or \"dist\" folder), then you need to provide the path to this folder.\n\n### Plugin Reload\n`--apps`: A list of apps that you want to reload the plugin into. If you don't provide this argument, the CLI will look into the host entry details in your manifest.json file and reload the plugin into all supported apps that are currently connected to the CLI service. If more than one version of the app is running, you can limit this app to a specific version by appending the version string to the app ID.\n\n### Getting Help\nTo get help on the command line, you can run:\n- `$ uxp help` - prints details of all the commands available in the CLI\n- `$ uxp <command> help` - prints details of specific command\n\n### Plugin Debug\n`--breakOnStart`: Blocks the plugin until a debugger attaches. If specified, attach is assumed, and a debugger will immediately be spawned. Defaults to false.(no content)`--apps`: If your plugin is loaded in multiple apps, you can use this option to choose the app in which you want to limit the debugging to.\n\n### Plugin Watch\n`--apps`: A list of apps that you want to watch the plugin for and reload contents on change. If you don't provide this argument, the CLI will look into the host entry details in your manifest.json file, watch the plugin directory and reload plugin into all supported apps that are currently connected to the CLI service when changes are saved. If more than one version of the app is running, you can limit this app to a specific version by appending the version string to the app ID.\n\n## Installation\n\nUXP Devtools is a standard tool for rapid Adobe UXP plugin development.

CREATING A NEW UXP PLUGIN PROJECT\n\n**Exact Command:**\n```bash\n$ uxp plugin init\n```\n\n**Interactive Mode:**\nWhen you run this command, the CLI will prompt you interactively for:\n- Plugin name\n- Plugin version\n- Plugin ID\n- Host app selection (Photoshop, XD, or both)\n- Template selection (automatically selected based on host app chosen)\n\n**Optional Template Flag:**\n```bash\n$ uxp plugin init --template <template-source>\n```\n- `--template`: Specify a template (default is `ps-starter` for Photoshop)\n- Can use local path: `../my-custom-template`\n\n---\n\n### 2. AVAILABLE CLI FLAGS AND OPTIONS\n\n| Command | Syntax | Flags/Options |\n|---------|--------|---------------|\n| **Service Start** | `uxp service start` | `--port <port>` (defaults to 14001) |\n| **Plugin Init** | `uxp plugin init` | `--template <source>` |\n| **Plugin Load** | `uxp plugin load <path>` | Requires path to manifest.json or build folder |\n| **Plugin Reload** | `uxp plugin reload` | `--apps <app-list>` (limits apps, optional) |\n| **Plugin Debug** | `uxp plugin debug` | `--breakOnStart`, `--apps <app-list>` |\n| **Plugin Watch** | `uxp plugin watch` | `--apps <app-list>` (for auto-reload on changes) |\n| **Plugin Test** | `uxp plugin test` | New in v1.5.1 - automated UI testing |\n| **Help** | `uxp help` | View all available commands |\n| **Help (Specific)** | `uxp <command> help` | View specific command details |\n\n---\n\n### 3. PROJECT SCAFFOLDING OPTIONS\n\nWhen running `uxp plugin init`, you can select from templates for:\n\n- **Photoshop (PS)**: Default template `ps-starter`\n- **Adobe XD (XD)**: XD-specific template\n- **Both PS and XD**: Common template supporting both apps\n\nThe init command creates:\n- `manifest.json` (plugin configuration)\n- Plugin source files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript structure)\n- Full directory structure in current working directory\n\n---\n\n### 4. TARGETING PREMIERE PRO SPECIFICALLY\n\n**IMPORTANT LIMITATION:** Current Adobe UXP documentation and the official CLI show support for:\n- Adobe Photoshop (June 2020 Release with UXP 3.8.24+)\n- Adobe XD (Version 36+ Mac; Version 38+ Windows)\n\n**Premiere Pro Status:**\nThe first search result from official Adobe documentation stated: \"UXP plugins are supported in Premiere v25.6 and later since UDT v2.2.\"\n\nHowever, the CLI README and template options currently show only Photoshop and XD templates. Premiere Pro support appears to be in development or limited. To check if Premiere Pro is available on your system:\n\n```bash\n$ uxp apps list\n```\n\nThis will discover all UXP-compatible Adobe apps currently installed.\n\n---\n\n### 5. CURRENT STABLE VERSION OF UXP TOOLKIT\n\n**Current Stable Version: v1.5.1** (Released February 9, 2025)\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\nnpm install -g @adobe/uxp-devtools-cli\n```\n\nOr use without global install:\n```bash\nnpx @adobe/uxp-devtools-cli@latest <command>\n```\n\n**Key Features in v1.5.1:**\n- New `uxp plugin test` command for automated UI testing\n- Support for WebDriverIO automation framework\n- Full plugin lifecycle management (init, load, reload, debug)\n- Chrome DevTools integration for debugging\n\n**System Requirements:**\n- macOS: Intel processors, version 10.15 or higher\n- Windows: Windows 10 (Intel only)\n- Node.js and npm for installation\n\n---\n\n### 6. ESSENTIAL WORKFLOW\n\n```bash\n# 1. Start the service (must run before any plugin operations)\n$ uxp service start --port 14001\n\n# 2. Create a new plugin\n$ cd your-projects-directory\n$ uxp plugin init\n# Follow interactive prompts\n\n# 3. Load plugin into app\n$ uxp plugin load ./path/to/manifest.json\n\n# 4. Auto-reload on changes\n$ npx nodemon --exec \"uxp plugin reload\" -e js,jsx,html\n\n# 5. Debug with DevTools\n$ uxp plugin debug\n# Then navigate to chrome://inspect in Chrome browser\n```\n\n---\n\n### 7. KNOWN LIMITATIONS & WARNINGS\n\n1. **Premiere Pro Support**: While mentioned in Premiere Pro documentation as supported in v25.6+, the CLI templates and examples primarily focus on Photoshop and XD\n2. **ARM Support**: Currently unavailable; Intel processors required for both macOS and Windows\n3. **Elevated Privileges**: UDT requires elevated permissions to function correctly on Windows\n4. **Third-party Focus**: CLI tools primarily target third-party plugin workflows\n\n---\n\n## Official Documentation Sources\n\n- [GitHub - adobe-uxp/devtools-cli](https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli)\n- [Essential Development Tools for UXP - Premiere Pro](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/)\n- [Adobe UXP Developer Tool - Photoshop](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/devtool/)\n- [UXP Developer Tools - InDesign](https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/)\n- [NPM Package - @adobe/uxp-devtools-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@adobe/uxp-devtools-cli)\n- [Adobe Blog - How to Install UXP Plugins Using Command Line Tools](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/how-to-install-uxp-plugins-using-command-line-tools-a6a62ca4cb1a)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":4,"cache_creation_input_tokens":224,"cache_read_input_tokens":24507,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":224,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWAkMDLPvAxZQRskkK4TL","type":"assistant","uuid":"c4cf346f-f709-45d6-9f3d-0812f4b7dc81","timestamp":"2025-12-16T17:19:21.067Z"}
