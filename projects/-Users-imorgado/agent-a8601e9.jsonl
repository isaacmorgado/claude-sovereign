Instead, you would adjust the duration of the existing trackItem, then insert a new trackItem, representing the remaining portion of the original trackItem.\n\n### QE DOM Razor Method (Unsupported but Functional)\nQE DOM has razor(string, bool, bool) method on sequence and track objects, though some users have reported difficulty getting it to work. You can accomplish that, without using the (unsupported, unrecommended) QE DOM.\n\nA working example using the QE DOM razor method was shared:\n\"After a long time of searching, I found out it was about calling the RAZOR method, which I never new existed. Here is some sample working code: // Enable Quality Enginering library app.enableQE(); // Get the active QE sequence var sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence(); // We need the playertime, but not in the normal Time() format, but rather in the format '00:00:03:38' var playerTime = sqe.CTI.timecode; // QE has a razor method that can be called on a sequence object // Cut only on track sqe.getV...\"\n\n### Alternative Workaround\nAs a workaround you can use overwriteClip() with one-frame media and then delete that new media immediately, so you will have two desired cutted clips BBBBUT with one frame gap.\n\n### Recommended Approach\nThe recommended approach without using QE DOM is to:\n1. Adjust the duration/end point of the existing trackItem\n2.

Instead, you would adjust the duration of the existing trackItem, then insert a new trackItem, representing the remaining portion of the original trackItem.\n\n### QE DOM Razor Method (Unsupported but Functional)\nQE DOM has razor(string, bool, bool) method on sequence and track objects, though some users have reported difficulty getting it to work. You can accomplish that, without using the (unsupported, unrecommended) QE DOM.\n\nA working example using the QE DOM razor method was shared:\n\"After a long time of searching, I found out it was about calling the RAZOR method, which I never new existed. Here is some sample working code: // Enable Quality Enginering library app.enableQE(); // Get the active QE sequence var sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence(); // We need the playertime, but not in the normal Time() format, but rather in the format '00:00:03:38' var playerTime = sqe.CTI.timecode; // QE has a razor method that can be called on a sequence object // Cut only on track sqe.getV...\"\n\n### Alternative Workaround\nAs a workaround you can use overwriteClip() with one-frame media and then delete that new media immediately, so you will have two desired cutted clips BBBBUT with one frame gap.\n\n### Recommended Approach\nThe recommended approach without using QE DOM is to:\n1. Adjust the duration/end point of the existing trackItem\n2. Insert a new trackItem representing the remaining portion\n\nThere's an example at https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/e60d6a22ef44d8eb4cca3904c35a0c050576b697/PProPanel/jsx/PPR...\n\n### UXP Note\nThere is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool.(no content)As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP; Unified Extensibility Platform.

Instead, you would adjust the duration of the existing trackItem, then insert a new trackItem, representing the remaining portion of the original trackItem.\"\n\n### Workarounds for Splitting Clips\n\n1. **Using createSubClip + insertClip**: You can use `app.project.rootItem.children[index].createSubClip(name, startTime, endTime, hasHardBoundaries, takeAudio, takeVideo)` and then insert this clipped project item to sequence track with `app.project.sequences[index].videoTracks[index].insertClip(projectItem, time)`.\n\n2. **OverwriteClip Workaround**: \"As a workaround you can use overwriteClip() with one-frame media and then delete that new media immediately, so you will have two desired cutted clips BBBBUT with one frame gap.

Instead, you would adjust the duration of the existing trackItem, then insert a new trackItem, representing the remaining portion of the original trackItem.\"\n\n### Workarounds for Splitting Clips\n\n1. **Using createSubClip + insertClip**: You can use `app.project.rootItem.children[index].createSubClip(name, startTime, endTime, hasHardBoundaries, takeAudio, takeVideo)` and then insert this clipped project item to sequence track with `app.project.sequences[index].videoTracks[index].insertClip(projectItem, time)`.\n\n2. **OverwriteClip Workaround**: \"As a workaround you can use overwriteClip() with one-frame media and then delete that new media immediately, so you will have two desired cutted clips BBBBUT with one frame gap. Another workaround is adjusting inPoint, outPoint, start and end, but it is a bit tricky: clip's inPoint and outPoint work in a strange nonobvious way, so make tests first.\"\n\n3. **QE DOM razor method**: \"There's no cut function in extendscript API. QE DOM has razor(string, bool, bool) method on sequence and track objects but I failed to get it to work.\"\n\n### Known Issues with setInPoint/setOutPoint\n\n\"When I set in/out points on the projectItem manually it is inserted correctly (with the manual in/out points), but if I set in/out via ExtendScript, the projectItem is not changed at all and so it's not inserted correctly. So instead of the insertClip function not respecting the in/out points, it seems that the in/out points of the sequence/projectItem are not set via the set-functions for in/out points.\"(no content)\"Tried tracking the clip that is inserted, and manipulating it after its added to the timeline, but it seems that setInPoint() is not a function to be used with videoTracks.clips.\"\n\n### Version Compatibility\n\n\"Your solution works in CC 2019, but not in CC 2017 (it appears setInPoint() and setOutPoint() don't exist for a project item in CC 2017).\"(no content)\"It has just been implemented with v2017.1, it's not available in previous versions.\"\n\n### Best Practice Recommendation\n\n\"I recommend setting the in/out points of the projectItem, before you insert a clip into the sequence.\"\n\n### Frame Accuracy Issues\n\n\"projectItem.setInPoint(seconds) projectItem.setOutPoint(seconds) …about 50% of the time the I/O points (in the source window) are set with a 1 frame error (sometimes 2 frames out).

Results return as JSON to Python for processing\n\n**Critical requirement:** Premiere Pro must be running; headless operation isn't supported.\n\n## Installation\n\n**Python Package:**\n```\npython -m pip install pymiere\n```\n\n**Premiere Pro Extension:**\n- Download platform-specific installer scripts (Windows .bat or Mac .sh)\n- Execute the script from command line/terminal\n- Verify installation: Window > Extensions should display \"Pymiere Link\"\n\nAlternatively, use Adobe's Extension Manager or third-party ZXP installers.\n\n## Capabilities & Limitations\n\nPymiere supports:\n- Property access and modification on Premiere objects\n- Method execution for automation\n- Data gathering from projects\n- Workflow automation using Python libraries (Qt, Shotgun API, etc.)\n\n**Notable limitation:** The documentation doesn't explicitly detail clip-cutting or razor/split functionality. The project focuses on \"gather data, check, edit and automate your projects\" but specific cut/split capabilities aren't documented in the provided content.\n\n## Version Support\n\n- Python 2 & 3\n- Premiere Pro 2017+ (2019+ recommended)\n- Windows 10, macOS Catalina tested\n\n## Current Status\n\n⚠️ **Unmaintained:** The project notes it's \"not maintained anymore\" though existing functionality remains functional.","durationMs":6798,"url":"https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere"}}

[This is the same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n- Export .srt file = no problem. You would use an output preset (.epr file) that specifies whatever settings you want. [Same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n- Each projectItem has XMP metadata (which includes markers); width/height info is included in that. [Same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n\n### Important Limitation\n\nIn PPro, all markers and metadata associated with trackItems, are actually attached to the backing projectItem; it's not possible to have different markers and metadata for each trackItem.\n\n### Manual Razor Tool Usage (for reference)\n\nFor manual editing, you can use the \"Razor Tool\" located in the editing toolbar on the left side of the timeline panel. The shortcut key for this tool is the \"C\" key on your keyboard.(no content)You can quickly fire off a split at your Current-Time Indicator by using the CTRL+K or Command+K keyboard shortcuts whether you are on Windows or Mac respectively.\n\nIn summary, as of late 2025, there is no programmatic way to perform razor/split operations on clips via the UXP API.

Returns a boolean; true if successful.(no content)This can be accomplished through `app.project.activeSequence.videoTracks[x].insertClip(clip, timecode in seconds)`.\n\n### overwriteClip()\n`app.project.sequences[index].overwriteClip(projectItem, time, vTrackIndex, aTrackIndex)` inserts a clip into the sequence, overwriting existing clips, on the specified video and audio tracks, at the specified time.\n\n### Track Behavior\nExecuting insertClip/overwriteClip always carries all picture and sound tracks from source clip to sequence. The timeline track activators play no role. For the purposes of a rough auto-assembly this is not a problem, even welcome.(no content)It does matter which track layer is chosen. Choosing videoTracks[0] or audioTracks[0] means a source clip with 1 picture track and 2 sound tracks will route to V1 and A1/A2 on the record side. Choosing videoTracks[1]/audioTracks[1] means Source V1/A1/A2 will route to Sequence V2/A2/A3.\n\n## Splitting Clips\n\nThere's no such thing as a 'cut', in the API. Instead, you would adjust the duration of the existing trackItem, then insert a new trackItem, representing the remaining portion of the original trackItem.\n\n### Workarounds for Splitting\nThere's no cut function in extendscript API. QE DOM has razor(string, bool, bool) method on sequence and track objects but I failed to get it to work. As a workaround you can use overwriteClip() with one-frame media and then delete that new media immediately, so you will have two desired cutted clips BBBBUT with one frame gap. Another workaround is adjusting inPoint, outPoint, start and end, but it is a bit tricky: clip's inPoint and outPoint work in a strange nonobvious way, so make tests first.(no content)You can use `app.project.rootItem.children[index].createSubClip(name, startTime, endTime, hasHardBoundaries, takeAudio, takeVideo);` and then insert this clipped project item to sequence track `app.project.sequences[index].videoTracks[index].insertClip(projectItem, time);`\n\n## In/Out Points Issue\nWhen setting in/out points on the projectItem manually it is inserted correctly (with the manual in/out points), but if setting in/out via ExtendScript, the projectItem is not changed at all and so it's not inserted correctly.\n\n## Important Notes\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).

Let me compile the complete answer.\n\n---\n\n## Premiere Pro Razor/Cut Tool Scripting: Complete Research Findings\n\n### 1. Programmatically Splitting Clips at a Specific Timecode\n\n**There is no native \"cut\" or \"split\" function in the official ExtendScript API.** Adobe explicitly states: \"There's no such thing as a 'cut', in the API.\"\n\n#### Workaround A: Adjust TrackItem Properties (Recommended Official Approach)\n\nModify the `start`, `end`, `inPoint`, and `outPoint` properties of existing clips, then insert a new trackItem for the remaining portion:\n\n```javascript\n// TrackItem properties available for manipulation:\nvar clip = app.project.activeSequence.videoTracks[0].clips[0];\n\n// Read/Write properties:\nclip.start    // Time - visible start in sequence\nclip.end      // Time - visible end in sequence  \nclip.inPoint  // Time - source in point\nclip.outPoint // Time - source out point\n\n// Example: Shorten clip by adjusting end point\nvar newEnd = clip.end;\nnewEnd.seconds = newEnd.seconds - 2;\nclip.end = newEnd;\n```\n\n#### Workaround B: SubClip + InsertClip Method\n\n```javascript\n// Create subclips with specific in/out points, then insert\napp.project.rootItem.children[index].createSubClip(\n    name, \n    startTime, \n    endTime,\n    hasHardBoundaries, \n    takeAudio, \n    takeVideo\n);\n\napp.project.sequences[index].videoTracks[index].insertClip(projectItem, time);\n```\n\n#### Workaround C: OverwriteClip Gap Workaround\n\nUse `overwriteClip()` with one-frame media, then delete it immediately. This creates two clips BUT with a one-frame gap between them.\n\n---\n\n### 2. QE (Quality Engineering) DOM - Hidden Razor API\n\nThe QE DOM is an **undocumented, unsupported internal API** that does include a `razor()` method.\n\n#### Working QE DOM Razor Example:\n\n```javascript\n// Enable Quality Engineering library (required first!)\napp.enableQE();\n\n// Get the active QE sequence\nvar qeSequence = qe.project.getActiveSequence();\n\n// Get current playhead position as timecode string (format: \"00:00:03:15\")\nvar playerTime = qeSequence.CTI.timecode;\n\n// Apply razor cut on first video track at playhead\nqeSequence.getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(playerTime);\n\n// Or cut at a specific timecode:\nqeSequence.getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(\"00:00:05:00\");\n```\n\n#### Important QE Caveats:\n- **Unsupported and unrecommended** by Adobe\n- Project model refreshing is unreliable\n- No guarantee it will work in future Premiere versions\n- QE DOM objects are **incompatible** with standard DOM objects\n\n#### QE Documentation Resources:\n- [Vakago Tools - Understanding the QE API](https://vakago-tools.com/premiere-pro-qe-api/)\n- [GitHub - Unofficial QE Documentation](https://github.com/amirul181/Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Quality-Engineering-QE-Unofficial-Documentation)\n- [Unofficial Premiere Pro CC API](https://vidjuheffex.github.io/ppro.api/)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Third-Party Tools and Libraries\n\n#### Pymiere (Python for Premiere Pro)\n\n**Repository:** [github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere](https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere)\n\n**Status:** No longer maintained, but functional\n\n**How it works:**\n1. Python commands convert to ExtendScript code\n2. Transmitted via HTTP to \"Pymiere Link\" extension\n3. Extension (Node.js server) executes code in Premiere Pro\n4. Results return as JSON\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\npython -m pip install pymiere\n# Then install Pymiere Link extension in Premiere Pro\n```\n\n**Pymiere Razor Example:**\n```python\nimport pymiere\nfrom pymiere.wrappers import timecode_from_time\n\nseq = pymiere.objects.app.project.activeSequence\ncurrent_time = seq.getPlayerPosition()\ntimecode = timecode_from_time(current_time, seq)\n\n# Use QE DOM razor via pymiere\npymiere.objects.qe.project.getActiveSequence().getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(timecode)\n```\n\n**Alternative Pymiere Razor Method:**\n```python\nfrom pymiere.wrappers import time_from_seconds\n\nseq = pymiere.objects.app.project.activeSequence\ntime = time_from_seconds(2.5)\ntimecode = time.getFormatted(\n    seq.getSettings().videoFrameRate, \n    seq.getSettings().videoDisplayFormat\n)\npymiere.objects.qe.project.getActiveSequence().getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(timecode)\n```\n\n#### Other Resources:\n- [Adobe-CEP/Samples PProPanel](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel) - Official sample panel\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n\n---\n\n### 4. QE DOM Deep Dive\n\n**Enabling QE:**\n```javascript\napp.enableQE();  // Must call before any qe.* functions\n```\n\n**QE-Only Methods:**\n\n| Method | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `track.razor(timecodeString)` | Splits clips at timecode |\n| `item.move(timecodeStr, duplicate, offsetSurrounding)` | Repositions clips |\n| `clip.addVideoEffect(effect)` | Applies effects (unavailable in standard API) |\n| `qe.project.getVideoEffectList()` | Lists all available effects |\n| `qe.project.undo()` | Undo operations |\n\n**QE Hierarchy:**\n```javascript\nqe.project.getActiveSequence()           // QE Sequence\n    .getVideoTrackAt(index)              // QE Track\n        .getItemAt(index)                // QE TrackItem\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. Keyboard Simulation / Macro Approaches\n\n#### Premiere Pro Native Shortcuts:\n- **C** - Razor Tool\n- **Cmd+K** (Mac) / **Ctrl+K** (Windows) - Cut at playhead on active tracks\n- **Shift+Cmd+K** / **Shift+Ctrl+K** - Cut all tracks at playhead\n\n#### AutoHotkey (Windows):\n- [PremiereProWithAutoHotKey](https://github.com/michaelmickspad/PremiereProWithAutoHotKey) - Hotkey configurator\n- [Tomshiii's AHK Scripts](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk) - Comprehensive editing automation\n- [TaranVH's 2nd Keyboard](https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard/blob/master/Almost_All_Premiere_Functions.ahk) - Advanced macro scripts\n\n#### AppleScript/Automator (macOS):\n\nTo trigger Cmd+K via AppleScript:\n1. Create AppleScript using Script Editor to send keystrokes\n2. Save as Quick Action in Automator\n3. Assign keyboard shortcut in System Preferences > Keyboard > Shortcuts\n4. Grant Accessibility permissions (Security & Privacy)\n\n**Note:** macOS Mojave+ requires explicit Accessibility permissions for sending keystrokes.\n\n---\n\n### 6. UXP API Status (2025)\n\nAs of late 2025:\n- **There is NO UXP API for razor tool functionality**\n- Adobe confirmed: \"There is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool\"\n- ExtendScript remains necessary for razor simulation\n- ExtendScript support planned through September 2026\n\n**Official UXP Documentation:** [developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n\n---\n\n### Summary: Best Practical Solutions\n\n| Approach | Reliability | Complexity | Recommendation |\n|----------|------------|------------|----------------|\n| **QE DOM razor()** | Medium | Low | Best option if you accept unsupported API risk |\n| **TrackItem property manipulation** | High | High | Official approach, requires manual second clip insertion |\n| **Pymiere + QE** | Medium | Low | Good for Python workflows |\n| **Keyboard simulation** | High | Medium | Platform-specific, requires UI focus |\n| **SubClip + InsertClip** | High | Medium | Creates subclips in project bin |\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Adobe Community: Perform a cut from script](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/perform-a-cut-from-script/td-p/11389974)\n- [Adobe Community: ExtendScript Split clip using insertClip](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/extendscript-split-clip-using-insertclip-method/m-p/14432687)\n- [Adobe Community: UXP Razor tool discussion](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-razor-tool-and-marking-clipped-sections/td-p/15547922)\n- [Adobe Community: QE DOM discussion](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/qe-what-is-this-rabbithole/m-p/7645304)\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [Pymiere GitHub](https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere)\n- [Pymiere Examples](https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere/blob/master/example_and_documentation.md)\n- [Vakago Tools - QE API Guide](https://vakago-tools.com/premiere-pro-qe-api/)\n- [Adobe-CEP/Samples](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples)\n- [Tomshiii AHK Scripts](https://github.com/Tomshiii/ahk)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":813,"cache_read_input_tokens":29363,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":813,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":2,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWJpGoECQomv9Pp7caJKd","type":"assistant","uuid":"67ea81e3-2f5b-40b3-90d7-530729714fa4","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:36:13.425Z"}
