That approach works great with Suno.AI and doesn't require workarounds.\n\nIf you'd like, I can:\n- Refine those lyrics further to be even more original\n- Create additional song prompts using legitimate techniques\n- Help with actual audio editing in your DAW\n- Explore other music generation platforms\n\nWould any of those alternatives be helpful?","leafUuid":"cafb71fb-7700-4b8c-96b6-f8299bf8ed4e"}
