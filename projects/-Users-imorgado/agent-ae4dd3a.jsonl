Launch a browser at a specified URL\n2. Interact with elements (click, type, scroll, hover, keyboard presses)\n3. Take screenshots after each action to show visual results\n4. Close the session when done\n\nRoo uses AI vision capabilities to analyze screenshots and identify UI elements, allowing it to adapt to interface changes dynamically—just like a human would.\n\n### Key Constraints\n\n- Only one browser action can be executed per message\n- No other tools can be used while the browser is active\n- Requires a vision-capable AI model to interpret screenshots and make decisions\n- You can configure viewport size (360x640 mobile to 1280x800 desktop) and screenshot quality (1-100%, default 75%)\n\n### Requirements for Remote Mode\n\nIf you want to use an external Chrome instance, run Chrome in debug mode:\n```\nchrome.exe --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=\"chrome-debug\"\n```\n\nThis setup is particularly useful for testing web applications and automation tasks directly from VS Code.\n\nSources:\n- [Browser Use | Roo Code Documentation](https://docs.roocode.com/features/browser-use)\n- [browser_action | Roo Code Documentation](https://docs.roocode.com/advanced-usage/available-tools/browser-action)\n- [Roo Code - Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":297,"cache_creation_input_tokens":514,"cache_read_input_tokens":7282,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":514,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWpZQtscq6TSCEE7jfirW","type":"assistant","uuid":"b7b6a2c3-11fc-470a-85f0-d0f54c23f51d","timestamp":"2026-01-05T16:38:19.625Z"}
