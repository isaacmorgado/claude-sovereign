ExtendScript can access and manipulate most project elements, including metadata, exporting and rendering options.(no content)Adobe ExtendScript is a JavaScript-based scripting language that allows developers to automate tasks in Premiere Pro. By leveraging ExtendScript, editors can automate video editing workflows, reduce manual work, and improve efficiency.\n\n## Current Status\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.(no content)No further changes or improvements to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled. Any such changes will be reconsidered once Premiere Pro moves to UXP-based extensibility.\n\n## Timeline Manipulation Capabilities\n\nThe API provides various timeline manipulation features:\n\n- New API to move a trackItem. New APIs to set the disabled state of a trackItem.\n- You can automatically insert video clips into a sequence using ExtendScript.\n- You can automate clip trimming to quickly edit multiple clips. Scripts can select all clips in the first video track and trim the first 5 seconds from each clip.\n\n## Limitations\n\nThere is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks. However, this is disputed - there have been zero changes to QE DOM APIs, and the `moveToTrack()` function may still work.(no content)There is no single ExtendScript call to split a clip based on playhead position, though workarounds may be possible.\n\n## Resources & Documentation\n\n- The PProPanel example extension (https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel), while very ugly, is thorough in demonstrating PPro's ExtendScript API. The project contains VSCode debugging configurations for JavaScript (the CEP layer) and ExtendScript.\n\n- Executing scripts from within CEP panels is the recommended approach. With additional configuration work, it's also possible to pass scripts to Premiere Pro on a command line.\n\n- Use VSCode with Adobe's extension for development and debugging; for deployed workflows, stick with panels whenever possible.\n\nThe main documentation is available at: https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"f23cb09d-c642-44ca-b8ce-55f4de49a558","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:30:48.982Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe Premiere Pro ExtendScript JavaScript timeline manipulation API","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01WvcJACuxwB76VwRXZtLq1Y","content":[{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/"},{"title":"Overview - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/introduction/extendscript-overview/"},{"title":"Request for Timeline Editing API Support (Clip Tra... - Adobe Product Community - 15624626","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625392"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Using Adobe ExtendScript to Automate Video Editing in Premiere Pro","url":"https://metadesignsolutions.com/using-adobe-extendscript-to-automate-video-editing-in-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Solved: Editing clips with ExtendScript - Adobe Product Community - 9056625","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/editing-clips-with-extendscript/td-p/9056625"},{"title":"Develop Your First Premiere Pro Extension: A Step-by-Step Guide","url":"https://vakago-tools.com/develop-your-first-premiere-pro-extension-a-step-by-step-guide/"},{"title":"Re: Automating Video Editing in Adobe Premiere Pro with ExtendScript","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/automating-video-editing-in-adobe-premiere-pro-with-extendscript/m-p/14473392"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Scripting ExtendScript question - Adobe Product Community - 13379442","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-extendscript-question/td-p/13379442"},{"title":"Looking for any current Scripting Documentation / Resources for Premiere Pro","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/looking-for-any-current-scripting-documentation-resources-for-premiere-pro/m-p/14423678"}]},"Here's what I found about Adobe Premiere Pro's ExtendScript JavaScript API for timeline manipulation:\n\n## Overview\n\nPremiere Pro's ExtendScript-based API allows for broad control of the entire application.

Reviewing Adobe's official blog for announcements about UXP availability in Premiere Pro\n4. Checking the Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums\n\nWould you like me to try the search again, or is there anything specific about CEP/UXP development I can help explain based on my existing knowledge?"],"durationSeconds":30.86757600000035}}

By reviewing every plugin, Adobe aims to help developers get ready for prime time and ensure that users have great experiences with the plugins they consume.(no content)Adobe's goal is to balance providing developers with the best developer experience during the review process as possible, while also ensuring the approved plugins offer a great user experience for their mutual customers.\n\n### Key Requirements\n\n#### Publisher Profile Requirements\nYou need to provide your publisher marketing website (which shows for all things you publish with Adobe and should be scoped to you as the publisher), along with a description of you, the publisher.\n\n#### EU Distribution Requirements\nIn accordance with the European Union Digital Services Act trader requirements, developers who wish to distribute their listings in the EU must provide additional information in their publisher profile. Any developer who wishes to distribute their listings in the EU can be identified as a trader. Developers must choose \"Yes\" if they wish to make their listings available in Adobe Exchange Marketplace for users in the European Union.\n\n#### Plugin Packaging Requirements\nFor a hybrid extension, the folder must include the resource files for the native plugin or scripting component. A file named \"mimetype\" will be generated by the signing process, which is detailed in the guide for packaging and signing your CEP plugins.(no content)MXI packaging is used for more generically formed packages. With an MXI, you can include multiple ZXP containing extensions and also include files to be placed anywhere on the user's system. You need to add manifest details such as a unique bundle id and versions for Adobe products that your app supports in a .mxi file, and the .mxi file should have the name that matches the bundle id of your extension.\n\n#### Paid Plugin Requirements\nFor paid plugin listings, you'll need to register with Adobe's third-party payment provider, FastSpring, and enter your FastSpring key into your publisher profile. It may take up to 24 hours for FastSpring to create your key.\n\n#### Listing Metadata\nYour listing metadata provides Adobe and users with details about the plugin you are currently submitting. The information you add will be made public to users via Adobe's Marketplace surfaces once your listing is published.\n\n### Preparation Tips\nThe Adobe submission guides are meant to provide developers with an idea of what types of information they will need for the submission process and how to best prepare for review.

The latest release of the SDK is available at: https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/premierepro.html\n\n### Plugin Types Available\n\nThe Premiere Pro SDK supports several plugin types including:\n- Video Effects Plugins – Custom filters, LUTs, and overlays\n- Transition Plugins – Custom wipe, dissolve, and animation transitions\n- Audio Effects Plugins – EQ, noise reduction, and AI-powered enhancements\n- File Import & Export Automation – Batch processing for video files(no content)There are two main plugin development approaches:\n- CEP Extensions (Common Extensibility Platform) – Built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for UI-based plugins\n- Native Plugins (C++ SDK) – Built using C++ for deeper integration with video processing\n\n### Getting Started with Transition Development\n\nIf you are developing a transition, begin with the SDK_CrossDissolve sample project, progressively replacing its functionality with your own. The sample project is also dependent on the After Effects SDK.(no content)On Windows, create an environment variable pointing to it named \"AE_SDK_BASE_PATH\", so that the compiler will find the AE headers. On MacOS, in XCode > Preferences > Locations > Custom Paths, specify AE_SDK_BASE_PATH to be the root folder of the AE SDK.\n\n### GPU Effects & Transitions\n\nThe GPU extensions allow plugins to have full access to GPU-resident frames without readback to system memory, when using the Mercury Playback Engine in a GPU-accelerated mode.(no content)Effects and transitions can optionally tell the host that they support real-time processing. The GPU extensions work on top of effects and transitions built using the After Effects SDK, supplementing a regular software effect or transition which defines the software rendering path, parameters, and custom UI drawing.\n\n### System Requirements for GPU Development\n\nThe system requirements for developing GPU effects & transitions are higher than developing other plugins. You'll need a video card that supports Mercury Playback Engine GPU acceleration and must ensure your video card supports the type of video acceleration you are developing.(no content)To compile GPU effects in Premiere SDK, Adobe highly recommends using CUDA SDK 11.8. The minimum CUDA Compute Capability has been increased to sm_50.(no content)For best compatibility, Adobe recommends utilizing CUDA Driver API only. Unlike the runtime API, the driver API is directly backwards compatible with future drivers.\n\n### Recent SDK Updates\n\nMultiple effects and transitions can now be implemented in a single plugin binary, by defining multiple entry points in software at runtime. This new method for registering entry points will be a replacement for the PiPL resource.(no content)AE-style Transitions can now get and set transition start and end percentages. To allow a plugin to be informed of changes to these values, there are functions in the PF TransitionSuite: RegisterTransitionStartParam() and RegisterTransitionEndParam().\n\n### C++ SDK Status\n\nThe C++ SDK is complete and used without issue by C++ plugin developers. The C++ SDK does not contain any CEP or UXP resources.(no content)Many Premiere Pro plugins use the After Effects SDK and may need the Premiere Pro headers, available at the Adobe Developer portal.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a7be8b84-3367-4951-9088-ea55cf22a340","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:32:04.461Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe Premiere Pro C++ SDK video effects transition plugin development","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01R1hr6BCv3XFDL43RvpGTPU","content":[{"title":"Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/"},{"title":"Developing Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins Using Adobe Premiere Pro SDK (With Code)","url":"https://metadesignsolutions.com/developing-adobe-premiere-pro-plugins-using-adobe-premiere-pro-sdk-with-code/"},{"title":"How to Develop a Custom Transition Effect Plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro","url":"https://metadesignsolutions.com/how-to-develop-a-custom-transition-effect-plugin-for-adobe-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"GPU Effects & Transitions — Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide 24.0 documentation","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/gpu-effects-transitions/gpu-effects-transitions.html"},{"title":"Whats New - Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/intro/whats-new/"},{"title":"GPU Effects & Transitions - Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/gpu-effects-transitions/gpu-effects-transitions/"},{"title":"Solved: Dear Adobe Developer Support, - Adobe Product Community - 15314149","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/dear-adobe-developer-support/td-p/15314149"},{"title":"Getting Started — Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide 24.0 documentation","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/ae-transition-extensions/getting-started.html"},{"title":"Getting Started - Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/ae-transition-extensions/getting-started/"},{"title":"Plugin Development for Adobe Premiere and After Effects | fxphd","url":"https://www.fxphd.com/details/526/"}]},"Based on my search, here's comprehensive information about Adobe Premiere Pro C++ SDK development for video effects and transition plugins:\n\n## Adobe Premiere Pro C++ SDK for Video Effects & Transition Plugin Development\n\n### Official SDK Resources\n\nThe Adobe Premiere Pro Software Development Kit is a living document that is constantly being updated and edited.

ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.(no content)On Dec 5th, 2024, Adobe opened their public beta for UXP Plugins in Premiere Pro. This moment has been long-awaited by Premiere plugin developers since UXP was originally announced by Adobe back in 2019.\n\n### What is UXP?\n\nUXP plugins panels are the new way for 3rd party developers to build plugin panels in Adobe applications in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.(no content)UXP Plugins are JavaScript/HTML/CSS based, however they are built on their own unique stack by Adobe which makes them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack. Additionally instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has 1 unified environment for your frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction back and forth.\n\n### Timeline and Clip Manipulation Capabilities\n\nThe UXP API allows access to sequences, tracks, clips, markers, project items, and application settings.(no content)An important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous and blocked the Premiere UI while they were executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### Recent API Updates\n\nAdobe has announced updates for UXP APIs available in recent versions of Premiere Pro (Beta), including ClipProjectItem API which allows for attaching proxy or high resolution footage or replacing footage with `attachProxy()` and `changeMediaPath()`, as well as EncoderManager and SequenceEditor APIs.\n\n### Getting Selection and Events\n\nThe API includes a `getSelection()` method that returns currently-selected clips as an Array of TrackItems, which works perfectly. Combined with `app.bind`, developers are able to get real-time events of what the selected item is set to.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThere is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks. Premiere Pro no longer includes a keyboard mappable command like Move Clip Up/Down Between Tracks, meaning even UI automation cannot rely on a universal shortcut.(no content)The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\n### Development Resources\n\nThe Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.(no content)There are sample plugins available to help develop UXP plugins within Premiere Pro. As of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins.\n\n### Recommendation for Developers\n\nIt's highly recommended to start looking at all of the Premiere Pro APIs your current extensions use (e.g., importing footage, adding clips to the timeline, exporting, etc.) and test if those features exist and work as you need them to in UXP.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"70793140-361d-4afa-a3c7-ca30284dad66","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:32:50.329Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"Premiere Pro\" UXP scripting API 2024 timeline clip manipulation modern JavaScript","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_012wguZDtMYCGjfTd1QWGXLX","content":[{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/"},{"title":"Request for Timeline Editing API Support (Clip Tra... - Adobe Product Community - 15624626","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625392"},{"title":"Premiere Pro UXP Beta — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/"},{"title":"How to Add Clips to a Sequence Using Premiere Pro UXP API? - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/how-to-add-clips-to-a-sequence-using-premiere-pro-uxp-api/8977"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"Solved: Selected clip in timeline? - Adobe Product Community - 8233928","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/selected-clip-in-timeline/td-p/8233928"},{"title":"Update of UXP APIs inside of Premiere Pro - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/update-of-uxp-apis-inside-of-premiere-pro/10384"},{"title":"Premiere API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about Premiere Pro UXP scripting API for timeline clip manipulation with modern JavaScript:\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP Scripting API Overview\n\n### Current Status\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).

Adobe Premiere Pro SDK Overview\n\nAdobe provides multiple development pathways for Premiere Pro plugins, each suited to different use cases:\n\n### Plugin Types You Can Build\n\n| Type | Technology | Use Case |\n|------|------------|----------|\n| **UXP Plugins** | HTML/CSS/JavaScript | Modern panel development (recommended for new projects) |\n| **CEP Extensions** | HTML/CSS/JavaScript + ExtendScript | Legacy panel development |\n| **C++ Native Plugins** | C++ | Video effects, transitions, importers/exporters, hardware integration |\n\n### C++ SDK Capabilities\n\nThe C++ SDK enables deep system integration for:\n- **Video Filters** - Custom effects and color processing\n- **GPU Effects & Transitions** - Hardware-accelerated processing using CUDA, OpenCL, Metal, or OpenGL\n- **Importers** - Support for additional media formats\n- **Exporters** - Custom encoding/output formats\n- **Transmitters** - Streaming and broadcast output\n- **Control Surfaces** - Hardware controller integration\n- **Audio Processing** - Custom audio effects\n\n**System Requirements for GPU Development:**\n- CUDA SDK 11.8 (recommended)\n- Minimum CUDA Compute Capability: sm_50\n- Video card supporting Mercury Playback Engine GPU acceleration\n\n---\n\n## 2. Languages and Frameworks\n\n### UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform) - The Modern Standard\n\n**Status:** As of December 2024, UXP entered public beta for Premiere Pro. Full support is available in Premiere Pro v25.6+.\n\n```\nLanguages: HTML5, CSS3, Modern JavaScript (ES6+)\nArchitecture: Single unified environment (no ExtendScript backend)\nPerformance: Lightweight stack (no Node.js or Chromium)\n```\n\n**Key Advantages:**\n- Asynchronous API calls that do not block the UI thread\n- Modern JavaScript instead of ECMAScript 3\n- Better performance than CEP\n- Single codebase for UI and host API calls\n\n### CEP (Common Extensibility Platform) - Legacy but Still Supported\n\n```\nLanguages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (frontend) + ExtendScript (backend)\nCEP Version: CEP 11 (Premiere Pro 23.x+) / CEP 12 (current)\nECMAScript: Version 3 (legacy)\n```\n\n**Note:** ExtendScript-based integrations remain supported through **September 2026**, but no further API improvements are planned.\n\n### C++ SDK\n\n```\nIDE: Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 (Windows)\n     Xcode (macOS)\nDependencies: After Effects SDK headers (for effects/transitions)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Creating Panels and UI\n\n### UXP Panel Development (Recommended)\n\nUXP panels use modern web technologies with Adobe's custom runtime:\n\n```javascript\n// UXP plugin example structure\nconst { app } = require(\"premiere\");\n\n// Get current project\nconst project = app.project;\n\n// Access sequences\nconst sequences = project.sequences;\n```\n\n**Key Resources:**\n- [Premiere Pro UXP API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [UXP Sample Plugins](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n\n### CEP Panel Development\n\n**Installation Locations:**\n```\nWindows: C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Adobe\\CEP\\extensions\nmacOS: /Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions\n```\n\n**Enable Debug Mode (for unsigned panels):**\n```bash\n# macOS (CEP 12)\ndefaults write /Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.CSXS.12.plist PlayerDebugMode 1\n\n# Windows (run as Administrator in PowerShell)\nreg add \"HKCU\\Software\\Adobe\\CSXS.12\" /v PlayerDebugMode /t REG_SZ /d 1\n```\n\n**Reference Sample:** The [PProPanel](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel) sample is Adobe's comprehensive reference implementation demonstrating all ExtendScript API capabilities.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Timeline and Clip Manipulation\n\n### ExtendScript API (CEP)\n\nThe ExtendScript API provides access to:\n- **Project** and **ProjectCollection** - Project management\n- **Sequence** and **Track** - Timeline access\n- **TrackItem** and **ProjectItem** - Clip manipulation\n- **Marker** and **MarkerCollection** - Annotations\n- **Encoder** - Export operations\n\n**Example - Inserting clips into a sequence:**\n```javascript\n// ExtendScript example\nvar project = app.project;\nvar sequence = project.activeSequence;\nvar rootItem = project.rootItem;\n\n// Insert clip at playhead position\nvar clipToInsert = rootItem.children[0]; // First item in project\nvar targetTime = sequence.getPlayerPosition();\nsequence.videoTracks[0].insertClip(clipToInsert, targetTime);\n```\n\n### UXP API\n\nUXP provides similar capabilities with async/await patterns:\n\n```javascript\n// UXP example\nconst { app } = require(\"premiere\");\n\nasync function getSelectedClips() {\n    const selection = await app.project.activeSequence.getSelection();\n    return selection; // Returns Array of TrackItems\n}\n```\n\n**Available UXP APIs (as of late 2024):**\n- `getSelection()` - Get selected clips\n- `ClipProjectItem` - Attach proxy/replace footage via `attachProxy()` and `changeMediaPath()`\n- `EncoderManager` - Export operations\n- `SequenceEditor` - Timeline manipulation\n\n### Known Limitations\n\n- **No vertical clip movement:** There is no API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) to move clips between tracks\n- **No single clip split call:** Splitting clips at playhead requires workarounds\n- **Async nature in UXP:** All method calls are asynchronous (properties remain synchronous)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Import/Export and Metadata\n\n### Media Import\n\n```javascript\n// ExtendScript - Import media\nvar importArray = [\"C:/path/to/video.mp4\"];\napp.project.importFiles(importArray);\n\n// Import with specific settings\napp.project.importFiles(importArray, \n    suppressUI,           // boolean\n    targetBin,            // ProjectItem\n    importAsNumberedStills // boolean\n);\n```\n\n### Export/Encoding\n\n```javascript\n// ExtendScript - Export sequence\nvar sequence = app.project.activeSequence;\nvar outputPath = \"C:/output/exported.mp4\";\nvar presetPath = \"C:/path/to/preset.epr\";\n\napp.encoder.encodeSequence(\n    sequence,\n    outputPath,\n    presetPath,\n    app.encoder.ENCODE_WORKAREA,  // or ENCODE_IN_TO_OUT, ENCODE_ENTIRE\n    true  // Remove from queue upon completion\n);\n```\n\n### Metadata Access\n\nPremiere Pro uses XMP (Extensible Metadata Platform) for metadata:\n\n```javascript\n// Get project item metadata\nvar projectItem = app.project.rootItem.children[0];\nvar metadata = projectItem.getProjectMetadata();\n\n// Set custom metadata\nprojectItem.setProjectMetadata(\n    \"Custom Value\",\n    [\"Column.PropertyText.Custom Field\"]\n);\n\n// Get XMP metadata\nvar xmpMetadata = projectItem.getXMPMetadata();\n```\n\n**Key Metadata Methods:**\n- `getProjectMetadata()` / `setProjectMetadata()` - Project-level metadata\n- `getXMPMetadata()` / `setXMPMetadata()` - Source file XMP metadata\n- Private metadata via Adobe-CEP APIs (project-item specific)\n\n**Limitation:** Adobe Media Encoder offers no APIs for sequence manipulation. For export metadata, you may need to re-import the exported file, modify metadata, save, then remove from project.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Plugin Distribution Requirements\n\n### Adobe Exchange Marketplace\n\nTo distribute on Adobe Exchange:\n\n#### Publisher Profile Requirements\n- Company/personal name\n- Marketing website and description\n- Publisher logo\n- **EU Traders:** Must provide business details per the EU Digital Services Act (deadline was February 17, 2025)\n\n#### Plugin Package Requirements\n\n**UXP Plugins:**\n```\n1. Compress contents (not parent folder) as .zip\n2. Rename extension to .ccx (for Premiere Pro)\n```\n\n**CEP/ZXP Plugins:**\n```\n1. Include CSXS folder with manifest.xml\n2. Sign using ZXPSignCmd tool\n```\n\n**Signing Command:**\n```bash\n./ZXPSignCmd -sign panelDir/ PanelName.zxp certificate.p12 password -tsa http://timestamp.digicert.com/\n```\n\n#### Paid Plugin Requirements\n- Register with FastSpring (Adobe's payment processor)\n- Enter FastSpring key in publisher profile\n- Processing time: up to 24 hours\n\n### Direct Distribution\n\nFor enterprise or offline distribution:\n- Provide signed `.zxp` files directly\n- Users install via UPIA (command-line Extension Manager)\n- Code signing certificates required:\n  - **macOS:** Apple Developer ID certificate + notarization\n  - **Windows:** Code signing certificate from trusted CA\n\n---\n\n## Quick Reference: Development Path Decision Tree\n\n```\nNeed custom video effects/transitions/codecs?\n  └─> C++ SDK\n\nNeed a panel UI for automation/workflow?\n  ├─> Starting new project (2024+)?\n  │     └─> UXP (modern JavaScript)\n  └─> Maintaining existing project?\n        └─> CEP + ExtendScript (supported through Sept 2026)\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Resources\n\n| Resource | URL |\n|----------|-----|\n| Official Developer Portal | https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/ |\n| C++ SDK Guide | https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/ |\n| ExtendScript Scripting Guide | https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/ |\n| UXP API Reference | https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ |\n| CEP Samples (PProPanel) | https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel |\n| UXP Samples | https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples |\n| SDK Forum | https://community.adobe.com/t5/forums/filteredbylabelpage/board-id/premiere-pro/label-name/sdk |\n| Submission Guide | https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/creative-cloud/docs/guides/submission/overview |\n\n---\n\n## Important Notes\n\n1. **UXP is the future:** Adobe recommends UXP for all new development. Test your required APIs in UXP before starting a new CEP project.\n\n2. **ExtendScript sunset:** No further improvements planned; supported through September 2026.\n\n3. **SDK access:** If you get \"Restricted Access\" when downloading the C++ SDK, try logging in with a Personal Adobe account rather than an organizational one.\n\n4. **Development environment:** VSCode with the ExtendScript Debugger extension is Adobe's recommended setup for CEP development.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n\n- [Adobe Premiere Pro Developer Portal](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/)\n- [Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [Adobe-CEP/Samples GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples)\n- [Adobe Developer Distribution - Submission Overview](https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/creative-cloud/docs/guides/submission/overview)\n- [Hyper Brew - Premiere Pro UXP Beta](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/)\n- [GPU Effects & Transitions Documentation](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/gpu-effects-transitions/gpu-effects-transitions/)\n- [MetaDesign Solutions - Premiere Pro Plugin Development](https://metadesignsolutions.com/developing-adobe-premiere-pro-plugins-using-adobe-premiere-pro-sdk-with-code/)\n- [Creative Cloud Developer Forums - UXP Updates](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/update-of-uxp-apis-inside-of-premiere-pro/10384)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1887,"cache_read_input_tokens":22006,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1887,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWAgs3mJKvQz8G54mj5VE","type":"assistant","uuid":"76ed000f-e56c-4008-9e84-13aecf495fc1","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:34:19.762Z"}
