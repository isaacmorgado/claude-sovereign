Stripe has been the gold standard, but with its MoR offering still in limited beta and high fees looming, many companies are taking a second look.\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### Stripe\n- With a flexible API, real-time analytics, and global support, Stripe gives full control over the billing experience. The biggest downside? Until now, Stripe didn't offer MoR (Merchant of Record) functionality.\n- In 2025, Stripe has finally rolled out a private beta for its own MoR service, set to charge an additional 3.5% on top of regular fees. That means full MoR coverage could soon be a part of Stripe's ecosystem—but at a premium.\n- Stripe Tax automatically calculates sales tax rates on your transactions, but you remain liable and still need to file and remit your own taxes. This can be a real headache for finance teams.\n- Stripe pays out daily.\n\n### Lemon Squeezy\n- Lemon Squeezy was acquired by Stripe on July 26, 2024, signaling Stripe's intention to accelerate its presence in the MoR space.\n- Lemon Squeezy is a Merchant of Record platform that handles payments, global taxes, compliance, and customer billing for SaaS and digital product companies. It's known for its elegant UI, built-in affiliate tracking, subscription billing, license key delivery, and no-code integrations.\n- Its pricing is set at 5% plus $0.50 per transaction, with an additional 1.5% for international payments. While that's fairly standard in the MoR space, it does add up, especially for higher-volume businesses.\n- Lemon Squeezy primarily targets small businesses, creators, and solopreneurs. It is designed for individuals and small companies that need a simple, user-friendly platform to sell digital products, subscriptions, and services online.\n\n### Paddle\n- Paddle uses a merchant of record (MoR) model to provide an all-in-one payments, billing, and sales tax solution for software businesses. It is the only MoR built specifically for SaaS, app, and digital product companies.\n- Paddle is a comprehensive revenue delivery platform tailored for SaaS companies. It offers tools to manage subscriptions, reduce churn, enhance global conversion rates, and ensure tax compliance. Paddle is designed to streamline and automate various aspects of revenue management.\n- A reseller like Paddle handles tax and remittance globally, taking full liability for sales tax, fighting fraud, chasing chargebacks, managing reconciliation and ensuring compliance.\n- One of Paddle's unique selling points is its ability to handle complex billing scenarios, such as usage-based pricing and multi-currency transactions.\n\n## Feature Comparison\n\n| Feature | Stripe | Lemon Squeezy | Paddle |\n|---------|--------|---------------|--------|\n| **Merchant of Record** | Private beta (3.5% extra) | Yes | Yes |\n| **Tax Compliance** | Calculate only (you file) | Full handling | Full handling |\n| **Subscription Management** | Basic subscription management features suitable for straightforward subscription models | Yes | Advanced subscription management tools, including flexible pricing plans, customer journey customization, and churn reduction strategies |\n| **Target Audience** | Developers/Enterprises | Small businesses/Creators | SaaS/Enterprises |\n| **Analytics** | Basic analytics covering transactional revenue and customer lifetime value | Basic | Advanced analytics with embedded ProfitWell Metrics, allowing for detailed SaaS metrics tracking and benchmarking |\n| **Security** | Standard security features like fraud prevention | Standard | Advanced security features, including PCI-DSS Level 1 compliance, tokenization, and end-to-end encryption |\n\n## Who Should Choose What?\n\n- **Opt for Stripe** if you require a highly customizable payment platform and have the development resources to create a unique checkout experience.\n\n- **Go with Lemon Squeezy** if you're a small business or creator looking for a simple, no-fuss way to manage payments and tax compliance.\n\n- **Choose Paddle** if you're a SaaS or digital product company seeking a comprehensive, hands-off solution that manages taxes and subscriptions globally.\n\n## Concerns to Consider\n\nSince the Stripe acquisition on July 26, 2024, the Lemon Squeezy roadmap has become a question mark. Will the brand remain separate? Will Stripe's MoR beta eventually absorb Lemon Squeezy into a broader product suite?

For example, a SaaS application with 5,000 users paying $20/month generates $100,000 MRR while spending just $125/month on authentication (0.125% of revenue).(no content)Clerk is a paid service but has a free tier for up to 10,000 monthly active users, charging $25 per month from there on.\n\n### Key Features for SaaS\n\nClerk provides prebuilt UI components and robust backend APIs that make it easy to build secure authentication flows (sign-up, sign-in), user sessions, RBAC, SaaS billing, and even multi-tenancy into your Next.js app.(no content)Clerk has all the features you need to onboard and manage the users and organizations of your multi-tenant SaaS application.

With Stripe Billing, you can set up and integrate different types of usage-based pricing models with your SaaS product.\n\n### Key Changes in 2025\nThe legacy usage records APIs are removed in Stripe version 2025-03-31.basil. To continue to send usage records, you need to use an API version on or before 2025-02-24.acacia.(no content)Starting with Stripe version 2025-03-31.basil, metered prices must be backed by meters.\n\n### New Billing Meters API\nUnlike usage records, billing meters don't require customers to have subscriptions before reporting usage and a single meter can track usage across multiple customers.(no content)As of March 2024, Stripe has introduced a new Meter API that simplifies usage reporting.\n\n### Recording Usage\nTo record usage, first configure your meter, and then send meter events that include the event name configured on the meter, customer ID, numerical value, and a timestamp (optional).(no content)Make sure the timestamp is within the past 35 calendar days and isn't more than 5 minutes in the future. The 5-minute window is for clock drift between your server and Stripe systems. The numerical usage value in the payload only accepts whole number values.\n\n### Rate Limits and High-Throughput Options\nThe Meter Event endpoint allows 1,000 calls per second in live mode.(no content)With the API v2, you can send up to 10,000 events per second to Stripe using meter event streams. This works in live mode only. Contact sales if you need to send up to 200,000 events per second.(no content)If you anticipate exceeding this limit, you have two options: Pre-aggregate your usage data before sending it to Stripe. For example, instead of sending an Event for each individual user action, you could accumulate usage across multiple actions and send a single aggregated event periodically.\n\n### Use Cases\nPay-as-you-go pricing is a flexible, scalable model that lets you charge customers in arrears for the usage they accrue. AI businesses, SaaS platforms, and cloud services often use this pricing model.(no content)In the past, software companies typically worked on a flat-rate subscription model. Now, they're increasingly switching to a model that charges by API call, gigabyte of storage, or computing hour.\n\n### How Meters Work\nMeters specify how to aggregate meter events over a billing period. Meter events represent all actions that customers take in your system (for example, API requests). Meters attach to prices and form the basis of what's billed.(no content)The meter uses either a Sum or Last aggregation formula to aggregate meter events.\n\n### Integration Considerations\nTo adopt usage-based billing with Stripe, you must meter your customer's usage and report it on their Stripe subscription. Reporting usage to Stripe comes with its own challenges around rate limits, errors, and exactly once delivery.\n\n### Alternative Tools for SaaS Billing (2025)\nAccording to recent comparisons, there are several options for usage-based billing:\n- Stripe Billing: Developer APIs for metering and billing on Stripe's payment rails.\n- Metronome: High-scale platform built for billions of usage events.\n- Orb: API-first for complex usage aggregation and custom billing logic.\n- m3ter: Specialized engine for designing and managing usage pricing models.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"62861d1c-ca32-45f6-9b1c-d789c6e1fce6","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:58:27.384Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Stripe usage records metering API SaaS subscription tracking 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01XNpbVXsozxEuuxTus9hhJZ","content":[{"title":"Record usage for billing with the API | Stripe Documentation","url":"https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/recording-usage-api"},{"title":"Record usage for billing | Stripe Documentation","url":"https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/recording-usage"},{"title":"Usage metering: A guide for businesses | Stripe","url":"https://stripe.com/en-pl/resources/more/usage-metering"},{"title":"Migrate to billing meters | Stripe Documentation","url":"https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based-legacy/migration-guide"},{"title":"12 Best Usage-Based Billing Software for SaaS 2025 | UniBee","url":"https://unibee.dev/blog/12-best-usage-based-billing-software-for-saas-2025/"},{"title":"How to set up usage-based billing with Stripe and Moesif for your API | Moesif Blog","url":"https://www.moesif.com/blog/developer-platforms/stripe/How-to-Set-Up-Usage-Based-Billing-with-Stripe-and-Moesif-for-your-API/"},{"title":"Set up a pay-as-you-go pricing model | Stripe Documentation","url":"https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based/implementation-guide"},{"title":"Meters | Stripe API Reference","url":"https://docs.stripe.com/api/billing/meter"},{"title":"How to Report Usage to Stripe | OpenMeter","url":"https://openmeter.io/blog/how-to-report-usage-to-stripe"},{"title":"Usage-based billing | Stripe Documentation","url":"https://docs.stripe.com/billing/subscriptions/usage-based"}]},"Here are the search results for \"Stripe usage records metering API SaaS subscription tracking 2025\":\n\n## Stripe Usage-Based Billing and Metering API (2025)\n\n### Overview\nUsage-based billing is a common pricing model for SaaS businesses that enables you to charge customers based on their usage of your product or service.

This strategic expansion acknowledges PostgreSQL's dominance in modern application development.(no content)Neon leads in cost-effectiveness for variable workloads with their August 2025 usage-based pricing revolution. Starting at just $5/month minimum, Neon charges $0.14/CU-hour for compute and $0.35/GB-month for storage, with automatic scale-to-zero after 5 minutes of inactivity. This model typically saves 40-60% compared to fixed-tier alternatives for applications with unpredictable traffic patterns.\n\n## Architecture & Features\n\n### Neon\nNeon is a serverless Postgres database built with a focus on providing a good developer experience and scalability. It separates storage and compute to allow developers to scale resources independently.(no content)Neon is mostly compatible with vanilla PostgreSQL. Neon rebuilds the paging layer and just lightly changes the Postgres codebase.(no content)Only Neon is truly serverless, meaning users don't need to manage servers or configure scaling.\n\n### Supabase\nSupabase is an open-source platform that provides managed PostgreSQL with built-in authentication, storage, real-time subscriptions, and REST and GraphQL APIs. It's often described as an open-source Firebase alternative.(no content)Supabase runs standard PostgreSQL with full access to features like JSONB, window functions, and extensions such as PostGIS or pg_vector.(no content)However, it doesn't support Bring Your Own Cloud (BYOC), and infrastructure-level configuration is limited. Teams looking for more fine-grained control over networking, scaling, or compliance tooling may find it less suited for production at scale.\n\n### PlanetScale\nPlanetScale is a serverless database platform providing highly scalable MySQL and PostgreSQL databases. Built on the open-source Vitess database clustering system, it is designed for developers and DevOps teams to manage large-scale applications with features like non-blocking schema changes and horizontal sharding.(no content)PlanetScale's MySQL compatibility is constrained. Vitess shared-nothing architecture carries inherent compatibility limitations.(no content)To support online DDL, PlanetScale disallows foreign keys entirely, which is more strict than Vitess' FK limitation.\n\n## Branching Features\n\nNeon and PlanetScale offer the most comprehensive database branching features. They support granular branching controls that allow for efficient development and testing workflows. Supabase has database branching functionalities but it is not yet as mature as that of the other providers.(no content)PlanetScale has two types of branches: Development branches are schema-only copies, and Data Branching allows pre-loading a development branch with data from a recent backup. PlanetScale also has a deploy request feature that helps merge schema diffs across branches.\n\n## Pricing (2025)\n\nPlanetScale starts at $39/month with no free tier since March 2024, reflecting enterprise-focused positioning.(no content)Supabase's free tier includes 500MB database and 1GB storage, enough for side projects and early MVPs.(no content)Neon uses a compute-hours model with the ability to scale to zero when not in use.\n\n## Compliance & Security\n\nBoth Neon and Supabase achieve SOC2 Type 2. Supabase is additionally HIPAA compliant, a requirement for storing health data such as medical records.(no content)Supabase Team plans ($599/month) include SSO, SOC 2, and compliance reporting. Neon Business tier provides HIPAA compliance and advanced monitoring.\n\n## Performance\n\nFor latency, PlanetScale and Neon are hitting sub-10ms latency, and Supabase with TCP provides both fast connections and queries.\n\n## When to Choose Each\n\n- **Neon**: Built for developers and perfect for startups that need databases that can grow and adapt.\n\n- **Supabase**: Choose this if you're building an MVP or early-stage product and want to move fast with built-in tools and minimal setup.\n\n- **PlanetScale**: Excellent choice for scaling existing MySQL applications or building highly available applications with global data distribution.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4e56cee9-a470-4925-9463-8bf168673a12","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:58:44.961Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Neon PostgreSQL vs PlanetScale vs Supabase database SaaS 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01YGDdRoeEXkjerEnDAuSGWu","content":[{"title":"Best alternatives to Neon and PlanetScale for PostgreSQL hosting (2025) | Blog — Northflank","url":"https://northflank.com/blog/neon-planetscale-postgres-alternatives"},{"title":"Neon vs. Supabase: Which One Should I Choose","url":"https://www.bytebase.com/blog/neon-vs-supabase/"},{"title":"Comparing Popular Cloud Databases - Neon, Supabase, PlanetScale","url":"https://kenny-io.hashnode.dev/comparing-popular-cloud-databases-neon-supabase-planetscale"},{"title":"PlanetScale vs. Neon: the Continued Saga between MySQL and PostgreSQL","url":"https://www.bytebase.com/blog/planetscale-vs-neon/"},{"title":"Neon vs PlanetScale vs Supabase","url":"https://bejamas.com/compare/neon-vs-planetscale-vs-supabase"},{"title":"Benchmarking Postgres — PlanetScale","url":"https://planetscale.com/blog/benchmarking-postgres"},{"title":"PlanetScale vs Supabase vs Neon vs Xata vs Turso vs CockroachDB - Developer-Focused Database Platform Comparison","url":"https://toolstac.com/compare/planetscale/supabase/neon/xata/turso/cockroachdb/developer-focused-comparison"},{"title":"Neon DB vs PlanetScale A Detailed Comparison","url":"https://www.nextbuild.co/blog/neon-db-vs-planetscale-a-detailed-comparison"},{"title":"Supabase vs PlanetScale: Which is Better in 2025","url":"https://www.leanware.co/insights/supabase-vs-planetscale"},{"title":"What's the fastest serverless database provider?","url":"https://pilcrow.vercel.app/blog/serverless-database-latency"}]},"Here's a comprehensive comparison of Neon, PlanetScale, and Supabase database SaaS platforms for 2025:\n\n## Overview\n\nNeon is primarily a database service, while Supabase is a BaaS (Backend-as-a-Service) with Postgres as one of its included services.(no content)Supabase gives you a PostgreSQL backend with built-in authentication, storage, and realtime updates, while PlanetScale offers a MySQL-compatible database powered by Vitess, designed for high-scale applications and branching workflows.\n\n## Key Developments in 2025\n\nOn May 14, 2025, Databricks announced its acquisition of Neon.(no content)The most significant PlanetScale development in 2025 is their PostgreSQL offering launch, currently in private preview.

In the silo model, each tenant has their own unique physical resource. The bridge model logically separates tenants on a physical resource, for example, a database-per-tenant on a shared physical database. In the pool model, all tenants share a single logical construct on a physical resource, for example, a single schema shared by all tenants.\n\n### Single Schema Approach (Pool Model)\n\nOne database, one schema: Just one schema that holds all the tables and an \"account ID\" for each tenant. This is the model Checkly chose for their SaaS application.(no content)This reduces operational complexity since only a single schema and secret needs to be managed for all tenants. It also allows connections to the database to be pooled more effectively and avoids the need to dynamically retrieve the permissions for the secrets. However, noisy neighbours might have a larger impact on performance and errors related to a single schema affect all tenants simultaneously. The pool model can introduce cost efficiencies over other isolation and partitioning strategies due to economies of scale.\n\n### Bridge Model (Database/Schema per Tenant)\n\nThere are two ways to implement the bridge isolation model on a PostgreSQL instance: databases and schemas. It's recommended to use one database per tenant instead of one schema per tenant. Compared with databases, schemas are logical constructs in PostgreSQL and do not separate out data on disk. Schemas also store files on a disk within the same directory in a database — in extreme cases, a system with many tenants can hit certain system limits, such as inode exhaustion.\n\n### Scaling with Sharding\n\nIf you have a distributed database that manages all tenants, then you're using your database for what it's designed to do. You could shard your tables on tenant_id and easily support 1000s or tens of thousands of tenants. Google's F1 paper is a good example that demonstrates a multi-tenant database that scales this way.\n\n### Handling Varying Data Across Tenants\n\nPostgreSQL has a rich set of semi-structured data types that include hstore, json, and jsonb. You can now represent the previous database schema by simply declaring a jsonb column and scale to thousands of tenants.\n\n## Subscription & Usage Tracking\n\n### Billing Cycle Tracking\n\nFor subscription and billing cycles, you need to keep track if payments are made. Using fields like stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id and current_period_ends, when a user signs up for a paid plan, Stripe webhooks can fill these fields. On each subsequent billing cycle, the API receives another webhook call and bumps the current_period_ends date field. If for any reason no money comes in, the date is never bumped. The rest of the code uses this field to check whether it should allow users to keep interacting with the product.\n\n### Plan Limits\n\nEach plan customers can subscribe to has volume limits associated with them. These can be things like amount of checks, amount of team mates, SMS messages sent per month. The upper limits for this are recorded in fields like max_api_checks.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nFrom a security perspective, cross-tenant data access can be prevented via PostgreSQL's built-in row level security (RLS) mechanism.\n\n### Schema-Level Benefits\n\nWith PostgreSQL schemas, you get independent scaling (you can move different tenants to different database servers if needed), custom extensions per tenant, easier tenant management (you can drop or create tenant schemas without affecting other tenants), and performance monitoring (you can track resource usage per tenant by monitoring schema-level statistics).\n\n## Resources\n\nFor more detailed implementation examples, the AWS Database Blog provides code samples for multi-tenant database access with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition in their GitHub repository.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"88268a3c-1744-4683-b4f8-edd3a962e6be","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:59:18.193Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"usage tracking database schema design SaaS PostgreSQL","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01EkgB7gUFGRTJUt4joroYTV","content":[{"title":"A database model for SAAS subscriptions in Postgres","url":"https://axellarsson.com/blog/modeling-saas-subscriptions-in-postgres/"},{"title":"Designing your SaaS Database for Scale with Postgres","url":"https://www.pgcon.org/2017/schedule/attachments/444_Percona-2017-Talk-US-multi-tenancy-designing-for-scale.pdf"},{"title":"Multi-tenant - Usage Tracking IOT system - Database Design - TimescaleDB and PostgreSQL - TigerData Community Forum","url":"https://forum.tigerdata.com/forum/t/multi-tenant-usage-tracking-iot-system-database-design/1987"},{"title":"Designing your SaaS Database for Scale with Postgres — Citus Docs 8.0 documentation","url":"https://citus-doc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/articles/designing_saas.html"},{"title":"Choose the right PostgreSQL data access pattern for your SaaS application | AWS Database Blog","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/database/choose-the-right-postgresql-data-access-pattern-for-your-saas-application/"},{"title":"Designing your SaaS Database for Scale with Postgres — Citus 7.1 documentation","url":"https://docs.citusdata.com/en/v7.1/articles/designing_saas.html"},{"title":"Introduction to PostgreSQL Schemas: A Practical Guide | by Miftahul Huda | Medium","url":"https://iniakunhuda.medium.com/introduction-to-postgresql-schemas-a-practical-guide-8089b351b953"},{"title":"Multi-tenant SaaS model with PostgreSQL, Mongo or DynamoDB?","url":"https://www.checklyhq.com/blog/building-a-multi-tenant-saas-data-model/"},{"title":"Designing your SaaS Database for Scale with Postgres - Citus Data","url":"https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2016/10/03/designing-your-saas-database-for-high-scalability/"},{"title":"Tiger Data: PostgreSQL++ for Time Series, Analytics & AI | Creators of TimescaleDB","url":"https://www.tigerdata.com/"}]},"Here are the search results for \"usage tracking database schema design SaaS PostgreSQL\":\n\n## Multi-Tenant Database Design Patterns\n\n### Basic Partitioning Models\n\nThere are three basic SaaS partitioning models: silo, bridge, and pool.

You can now represent the previous database schema by simply declaring a jsonb column and scale to thousands of tenants.\n\n## Subscription & Usage Tracking\n\n### Billing Cycle Tracking\n\nFor subscription and billing cycles, you need to keep track if payments are made. Using fields like stripe_customer_id, stripe_subscription_id and current_period_ends, when a user signs up for a paid plan, Stripe webhooks can fill these fields. On each subsequent billing cycle, the API receives another webhook call and bumps the current_period_ends date field. If for any reason no money comes in, the date is never bumped. The rest of the code uses this field to check whether it should allow users to keep interacting with the product.\n\n### Plan Limits\n\nEach plan customers can subscribe to has volume limits associated with them. These can be things like amount of checks, amount of team mates, SMS messages sent per month. The upper limits for this are recorded in fields like max_api_checks.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nFrom a security perspective, cross-tenant data access can be prevented via PostgreSQL's built-in row level security (RLS) mechanism.\n\n### Schema-Level Benefits\n\nWith PostgreSQL schemas, you get independent scaling (you can move different tenants to different database servers if needed), custom extensions per tenant, easier tenant management (you can drop or create tenant schemas without affecting other tenants), and performance monitoring (you can track resource usage per tenant by monitoring schema-level statistics).\n\n## Resources\n\nFor more detailed implementation examples, the AWS Database Blog provides code samples for multi-tenant database access with Amazon RDS for PostgreSQL and Amazon Aurora PostgreSQL-Compatible Edition in their GitHub repository."],"durationSeconds":28.52689383299928}}
