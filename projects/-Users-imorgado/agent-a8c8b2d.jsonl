On macOS, the minimum environment is XCode 16.2 on macOS 15.4 or later.\n\n### SDK Resources\n\nThe latest release of the SDK is available at: https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/premierepro.html(no content)The C++ SDK is complete, and used without issue by C++ plugin developers. The C++ SDK does not contain any CEP or UXP resources.\n\n### Sequence-Related Suites\n\nThe SDK includes several suites for working with sequences, clips, and tracks:\n\n- The Sequence Info Suite provides a call to get the sequence frame rate, which may be useful for effects.\n\n- The Video Segment Suite provides a call to retrieve a segment node for a requested time, along with new properties for media nodes.\n\n- The Video Segment Suite also provides access to a new property: Effect_ClipName.\n\n- The Clip Render Suite includes calls to find any custom pixel format supported by a clip, and to get frames in those custom pixel formats. An exporter can use this suite to request frames from the renderer in a compressed pixel format.\n\n### Working with Sequences in Exporters\n\nWhen an exporter, which is running in Media Encoder, parses the sequence, it only has a very high-level view. It sees the entire sequence as a single clip, and sees any optional cropping or filters as applied effects.(no content)When parsing that simple, high-level sequence, if there are no effects, an exporter can use the MediaNode's ClipID with the Clip Render Suite to get frames directly from the PProHeadless process. In the PProHeadless process, a renderer plugin can step in, parse the real sequence in all its glory, and optionally provide frames in a custom pixel format.\n\n### Plugin Types\n\nThe SDK supports Panel Plugins (UXP/CEP Extensions) for custom UI panels, Video Effects Plugins for custom filters, LUTs, and overlays, Transition Plugins for custom wipe, dissolve, and animation transitions, Audio Effects Plugins for EQ, noise reduction, and AI-powered enhancements, and File Import & Export Automation for batch processing video files.\n\n### Community Documentation\n\nA community-supported repo hosts the Premiere C++ Plugin SDK Guide docs, and contributors are welcome and encouraged to suggest fixes, adjustments, notes/warnings, and anything else that may help the project.\n\nFor specific information about `PrSDKSequenceAPI` header files and functions for manipulating clips and tracks programmatically, you would need to consult the actual SDK header files, as the documentation primarily covers the conceptual framework and available suites rather than specific API function signatures.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"05f9779d-829f-4108-aed0-59d8abdbf47a","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:30:32.398Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"PrSDKSequenceAPI Premiere Pro SDK C++ clips tracks","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01MnN6LvJJ56vCrRPUGB3hcp","content":[{"title":"Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/"},{"title":"Getting Started - Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/exporters/getting-started/"},{"title":"GitHub - docsforadobe/premiere-plugin-guide: Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://github.com/docsforadobe/premiere-plugin-guide"},{"title":"Solved: Dear Adobe Developer Support, - Adobe Product Community - 15314149","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/dear-adobe-developer-support/td-p/15314149"},{"title":"Whats New - Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/intro/whats-new/"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide Release 22.0 control su... - Adobe Product Community - 12810973","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-c-sdk-guide-release-22-0-control-surface/td-p/12810973"},{"title":"Developing Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins Using Adobe Premiere Pro SDK (With Code)","url":"https://metadesignsolutions.com/developing-adobe-premiere-pro-plugins-using-adobe-premiere-pro-sdk-with-code/"},{"title":"SDK Audience - Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/intro/sdk-audience/"},{"title":"SweetPea Suites - Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/universals/sweetpea-suites/"},{"title":"How to Build a Video Editing Automation Plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro","url":"https://metadesignsolutions.com/how-to-build-a-video-editing-automation-plugin-for-adobe-premiere-pro/"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about PrSDKSequenceAPI and the Premiere Pro SDK for C++ development with clips and tracks:\n\n## Premiere Pro C++ SDK Overview\n\nThe Premiere Pro Software Development Kit enables developers to create plugins for Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition, Media Encoder, Character Animator, and Premiere Elements.(no content)The sample code is written in C++, and other compilers and programming languages are not supported.\n\n### Development Environment Requirements\nThe required development environment for Windows is Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Update 3 on Windows 11.

The latest release of the SDK is available at: https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/premierepro.html(no content)You can build powerful, low-level integrations using C++. The documentation is packaged with the SDK.(no content)If you get \"Restricted Access\" when trying to download the C++ SDK and documentation, try logging in with a Personal account.\n\n### Key Sequence and Timeline APIs\n\nThe Sequence Info Suite can retrieve the field type, zero point, and whether or not the timecode is drop-frame. There are also new flags to the transition API as a hint to optimize rendering when a transition only has an input on one side. The Video Segment Suite provides access to new properties.(no content)Sequence Info Suite is now at version 5, adding the new call GetImmersiveVideoVRConfiguration(), which returns the VR video settings of the specified sequence. A new selector is also available for Export Info Suite: kExportInfo_SourceBitrate, which returns the source's bitrate in kbps.\n\n### SDK Status and Availability\n\nThe C++ SDK is complete, and used without issue by C++ plugin developers. The C++ SDK does not contain any CEP or UXP resources.(no content)Many Premiere Pro plugins use the After Effects SDK — They may need the Premiere Pro headers.\n\n### Alternative Approaches for Timeline Manipulation\n\nPremiere Pro's ExtendScript-based API allows for broad control of the entire application.

The latest release of the SDK is available at: https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/premierepro.html(no content)You can build powerful, low-level integrations using C++. The documentation is packaged with the SDK.(no content)If you get \"Restricted Access\" when trying to download the C++ SDK and documentation, try logging in with a Personal account.\n\n### Key Sequence and Timeline APIs\n\nThe Sequence Info Suite can retrieve the field type, zero point, and whether or not the timecode is drop-frame. There are also new flags to the transition API as a hint to optimize rendering when a transition only has an input on one side. The Video Segment Suite provides access to new properties.(no content)Sequence Info Suite is now at version 5, adding the new call GetImmersiveVideoVRConfiguration(), which returns the VR video settings of the specified sequence. A new selector is also available for Export Info Suite: kExportInfo_SourceBitrate, which returns the source's bitrate in kbps.\n\n### SDK Status and Availability\n\nThe C++ SDK is complete, and used without issue by C++ plugin developers. The C++ SDK does not contain any CEP or UXP resources.(no content)Many Premiere Pro plugins use the After Effects SDK — They may need the Premiere Pro headers.\n\n### Alternative Approaches for Timeline Manipulation\n\nPremiere Pro's ExtendScript-based API allows for broad control of the entire application. ExtendScript can access and manipulate most project elements, including metadata, exporting and rendering options.(no content)As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.(no content)The Adobe Premiere Pro C++ SDK allows automating complex tasks, adding custom panels, supporting new file formats and codecs, designing new effects, and integrating hardware.

The search results provide general information about the Premiere Pro C++ SDK but do not contain specific details about these particular track item functions.\n\nHere's what I found:\n\nThere is no C++ API around track item selection. This indicates that the C++ SDK has limited support for track item manipulation compared to the scripting API.\n\nThat's not the case. The C++ SDK is complete, and used without issue by our C++ plugin developers.(no content)Two main plugin types in Premiere Pro exist: CEP Extensions (Common Extensibility Platform) – Built using HTML, JavaScript, and CSS for UI-based plugins.

This is the API that provides built-in support for EUCON and Mackie devices to control audio mixing and basic transport controls. The API supports two-way communication with Premiere Pro, so that hardware faders, VU meters, etc are in sync with the application.\n\n### Plugin Architecture\n\nThe Startup() function is called where the plugin registers a suite of functions as defined in ControlSurfacePluginSuite.h. For each base class it will inherit from (defined in adobesdkcontrolsurfacepluginwrapper), it calls RegisterSuite(). These suites are the way for the host application to call the control surface plugin later on. There are separate base classes for the transport controls, audio mixer, Lumetri Color controls, and more.(no content)Then, CreatePluginInstance() is called. When a project is opened, Connect() is called. Here the plugin instantiates a ControlSurface object, which inherits from any of the previously mentioned base classes. It acquires any host suites it needs, and then it passes back a reference to the ControlSurface object.\n\n### Plugin Installation\n\nCompile the sample plugin into a subfolder of the main application folder: Plugins\\ControlSurface\\ You should see the plugin in the PPro UI in Preferences > Control Surface, when you hit the Add button, as one of the options in the Device Class drop-down next to Mackie and EUCON.(no content)Starting in CC 2015.3, control surface plugins should be installed here: /Library/Application Support/Adobe/Common/Plugins/ControlSurface/\n\n### Implementation Details\n\nYou'll want to implement handlers for any relevant functions defined in the plugin suites at: adobesdk\\controlsurface\\plugin. And to do that, you can use any APIs to call into the host defined in the host suites at: adobesdk\\controlsurface\\host.\n\n### Playhead/Timeline Commands Available\n\nCommands related to the playhead include: \"cmd.timeline.transition.apply.default.video.to.playhead\" for Apply Default Video Transition To Playhead.\n\n### Additional Features\n\nNew suites have been added for Control Surfaces to support the Lumetri Color panel.

There is a Compositor node with n inputs. Each of those inputs is a Clip node, which has one input which is a Media node, and it also has n Operators, which are effects.\n\n### Node Structure\n\nThe segment tree structure looks like this:\n- **Compositor Node** (root)\n  - **Clip Node** → **Media Node** (bottom clip)\n  - **Clip Node** → **Media Node** (middle clip)  \n  - **Clip Node** → **Media Node** (top clip) with **Clip Operators** (Blur, Color Corrector, Motion)\n\n### Key Node Types (kVideoSegment)\n\nThe main node types in the video segment tree are:\n1. **Compositor Node** - The root node with n inputs representing combined/composited layers\n2. **Clip Node** - Represents each clip in the stack\n3. **Media Node** - Represents the actual media source for each clip\n4. **Operators** - Effects applied to clips (such as blur, color correction, motion)\n\n### Header Files\n\nThe relevant header files are PrSDKVideoSegmentSuite.h and PrSDKVideoSegmentProperties.h.(no content)GetProperty() is defined in PrGPUFilterModule.h, and the kVideoSegmentProperty_ IDs are defined in PrSDKVideoSegmentProperties.h.\n\n### Video Segment Suite\n\nThis suite provides calls to parse a sequence and get details on video segments. All the queryable node properties are in PrSDKVideoSegmentProperties.h. These properties will be returned as PrSDKStrings, and should be managed using the String Suite.(no content)The segments provide a hash value that the caller can use to quickly determine whether or not a segment has changed. This hash value can be maintained even if a segment is shifted in time. In version 4, new in CS5.5, the new call AcquireNodeForTime() passes back a segment node for a requested time.\n\n### Testing the Segment Structure\n\nTo get a good idea of the segment structure, try the SDK player, create a sequence using the SDK Editing Mode, and watch the text overlay in the Sequence Monitor as you perform edits.\n\nFor the specific `kVideoSegment` property constants and node type enumeration values, you would need to consult the actual `PrSDKVideoSegmentProperties.h` header file included in the Adobe Premiere Pro SDK download.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"04c31a50-ca79-44ab-8c31-ff28d0f764a0","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:34:06.397Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro SDK \"PrSDKVideoSegmentProperties.h\" kVideoSegment node types","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01NKV7pfHwW6jYx4cTJM81Lz","content":[{"title":"SweetPea Suites - Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/universals/sweetpea-suites/"},{"title":"Whats New - Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/intro/whats-new/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro on Adobe Support Community","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/forums/filteredbylabelpage/board-id/premiere-pro/label-name/sdk?profile.language=en"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Plug-In Types - Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/intro/premiere-pro-plugin-types/"},{"title":"Suites — Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide 24.0 documentation","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/gpu-effects-transitions/suites.html"},{"title":"Premiere Pro SDK??? - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/premiere-pro-sdkaeaeae/"},{"title":"Premiere SDK Guide","url":"https://usermanual.wiki/Document/PremiereSDKGuide.1812344349/help"},{"title":"GitHub - docsforadobe/premiere-plugin-guide: Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://github.com/docsforadobe/premiere-plugin-guide"},{"title":"Basic Types Structures - Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide","url":"https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/universals/basic-types-structures/"},{"title":"Developing Adobe Premiere Pro Plugins Using Adobe Premiere Pro SDK (With Code)","url":"https://metadesignsolutions.com/developing-adobe-premiere-pro-plugins-using-adobe-premiere-pro-sdk-with-code/"}]},"Based on my search results, I found some relevant information about the Premiere Pro SDK and video segment properties.

Classes Representing Sequences, Tracks, and Clips\n\nThe Premiere Pro C++ SDK does **not expose direct C++ classes** for sequences, tracks, and clips in the traditional object-oriented sense. Instead, it uses a **suite-based architecture** with opaque handles:\n\n**Video Segment Suite** provides access to a tree structure:\n- **Compositor Node** - Root node with n inputs representing composited layers\n- **Clip Node** - Represents each clip in the timeline stack\n- **Media Node** - Represents the actual media source for each clip\n- **Operators** - Effects applied to clips (blur, color correction, motion)\n\n**Key Identifiers:**\n- `PrTimelineID` - Identifies a sequence/timeline\n- `PrClipID` - Identifies a specific clip\n- Segment node IDs from the Video Segment Suite\n\n---\n\n### 2. Razor/Split/Cut Function in C++ API\n\n**There is NO native razor/split/cut function in the public C++ SDK.**\n\nThe C++ SDK is primarily designed for:\n- Importers\n- Exporters\n- Effects and transitions\n- Transmitters\n- Control surfaces\n\nDirect timeline editing operations like razor cuts are **not exposed** to third-party C++ plugins. The community documentation confirms:\n- ExtendScript has no cut function either\n- QE DOM has a `razor(string, bool, bool)` method but it is **unsupported and not recommended**\n- The workaround is to modify clip endpoints or add clips with different in/out points\n\n---\n\n### 3. Accessing Current Timeline and Playhead Position\n\n**Sequence Info Suite** (`PrSDKSequenceInfoSuite.h`):\n- `GetZeroPoint()` - Gets the sequence start time offset\n- `GetFrameRate()` - Retrieves sequence frame rate\n- `GetFieldType()` - Returns field dominance\n- `GetTimecodeDropFrame()` - Checks timecode format\n- `GetImmersiveVideoVRConfiguration()` - VR settings (v5)\n\n**Time Suite** (`PrSDKTimeSuite.h`):\n- `GetTicksPerSecond()` - Time conversion utilities\n\n**For render context timing:**\n```\ninRenderParams->inSequenceTime / PrSDKTimeSuite.GetTicksPerSecond\n```\n\n**Important Limitation:** The SDK provides the current render frame time for effects/transitions, but **direct playhead position reading is not available** for general plugins. The timeline ID (`PrTimelineID`) is available on both CPU and GPU rendering paths via `inRenderParams` or `ioInstanceData`.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Manipulating TrackItems (Clips) Programmatically\n\n**The C++ SDK has very limited clip manipulation capabilities:**\n\n**Video Segment Suite** (`PrSDKVideoSegmentSuite.h`) - Read-only access:\n- `AcquireNodeForTime()` - Gets segment node at specific time\n- `AcquireFirstNodeInTimeRange()` - Returns first node in a range\n- `AcquireOperatorOwnerNodeID()` - Gets effect node information\n- Properties like `Effect_ClipName`, clip hash values\n\n**Clip Render Suite** - For source frame access:\n- Find custom pixel formats supported by a clip\n- Get frames in custom pixel formats\n\n**Documented functions mentioned but not fully specified:**\n- `GetUnscaledClipStart()` - Gets clip start time without speed/retime changes\n- `GetTrackItemStart()` - Gets track item start time\n\n**Critical Note:** There is **no C++ API for track item selection** or direct manipulation like moving, trimming, or splitting clips. The Video Segment Suite provides read-only parsing of the timeline structure.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Headers/Includes Needed for Sequence Manipulation\n\n**Primary headers:**\n- `PrSDKVideoSegmentSuite.h` - Segment tree parsing\n- `PrSDKVideoSegmentProperties.h` - Property constants (kVideoSegmentProperty_*)\n- `PrSDKSequenceInfoSuite.h` - Sequence properties\n- `PrSDKTimeSuite.h` - Time/tick conversion\n- `PrSDKTypes.h` - Basic types and structures\n\n**Additional related headers:**\n- `PrSDKClipRenderSuite.h` - Source frame access\n- `PrSDKVideoSegmentRenderSuite.h` - Segment rendering\n- `PrGPUFilterModule.h` - Contains GetProperty() for segment properties\n- `PrSDKStreamLabel.h` - Stream labeling\n\n---\n\n### 6. Sample Projects That Modify Sequences\n\n**None of the official sample projects directly modify sequences.** The samples include:\n- SDK File Importer\n- Synth Import\n- SDK Custom Import\n- Export Controller\n- SDK Exporter\n- Transmitter\n- SDK_ProcAmp (GPU effect)\n- Vignette (GPU effect)\n- SDK_CrossDissolve (GPU transition)\n- ControlSurface\n\nThe **SDK Player** sample can display the segment structure via text overlay, which is useful for understanding the timeline tree.\n\n---\n\n### 7. PrSDKSequenceAPI / Related APIs\n\nThere is no single \"PrSDKSequenceAPI\" header. Instead, sequence-related functionality is split across multiple suites:\n\n**Video Segment Suite** (v6+):\n- Tree-based sequence parsing\n- Segment hash values for change detection\n- `kVideoSegment_NodeType_AdjustmentEffect` node type\n\n**Video Segment Render Suite**:\n- `MakeVideoRendererForTimeline()` - Creates renderer\n- `RenderColorManagedVideoFrame()` - Renders with color management\n- `PrefetchColorManagedMediaWithRenderParameters()` - Pre-fetches frames\n- Supports subtree rendering for exporters/players\n\n**Sequence Render Suite** (for exporters):\n- Synchronous and asynchronous rendering\n- Color management integration\n- Frame prefetching\n\n**Sequence Audio Suite** (v2):\n- `MakeAudioRenderer()` with channel labels\n- Audio frame delivery\n\n---\n\n### 8. Undo/Redo for C++ Operations\n\n**There is NO undo/redo API available in the public C++ SDK.**\n\nKey findings:\n- ExtendScript operations operate **outside the Undo stack**\n- Feature request DVAPR-4235114 exists for undo stack grouping\n- **No transaction system** for grouping operations\n\n**Recommended workaround:**\n- Duplicate the sequence first\n- Operate on the duplicate\n- Delete original only after success\n\n---\n\n## Summary: C++ SDK Limitations for Timeline Editing\n\nThe Premiere Pro C++ SDK is **primarily designed for media processing plugins** (importers, exporters, effects, transitions, transmitters, control surfaces) rather than timeline editing operations. Key limitations:\n\n1. **No direct clip manipulation** - Cannot cut, move, or resize clips\n2. **Read-only timeline access** - Video Segment Suite parses but doesn't modify\n3. **No undo/redo integration** - Operations have no transaction support\n4. **No playhead control** - Cannot get/set CTI position programmatically\n5. **No track item selection API** - Cannot select clips in C++\n\nFor timeline manipulation, Adobe recommends:\n- **UXP API** (Premiere v25.6+) - New scripting platform\n- **ExtendScript** (legacy, supported through Sept 2026)\n- These scripting APIs have sequence, track, and trackItem objects with manipulation methods\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [SweetPea Suites Documentation](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/universals/sweetpea-suites/)\n- [What's New in SDK](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/intro/whats-new/)\n- [Control Surfaces Documentation](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/control-surfaces/control-surfaces/)\n- [Sample Projects](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/intro/sample-projects/)\n- [Exporter Suites](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/exporters/suites/)\n- [Adobe Developer Portal](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/)\n- [Adobe Community - SDK Discussion on Undo](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/does-a-transaction-system-exist-for-modifying-a-project-sequence-in-extendedscript/m-p/12598546)\n- [Adobe Community - Perform a cut from script](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/perform-a-cut-from-script/td-p/11389974)\n- [GitHub - Premiere Plugin Guide](https://github.com/docsforadobe/premiere-plugin-guide)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3240,"cache_read_input_tokens":28272,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3240,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGgeXqfNma7sFA1FUGkt","type":"assistant","uuid":"c63b29b9-c89b-431c-a83c-594e5c6e0b32","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:34:54.259Z"}
