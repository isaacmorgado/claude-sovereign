The basic configuration involves:\n\n```typescript\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\nimport tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [tsconfigPaths(), react()],\n  test: {\n    environment: 'jsdom',\n  },\n})\n```\n\nOne of the main advantages of Vitest is its unified configuration with Vite. If present, Vitest will read your root `vite.config.ts` to match with the plugins and setup as your Vite app.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### 1. Explicit Imports\nIt's important to explicitly import test functions like `describe`, `it`, and `expect` instead of relying on global exposure. Even though setting `globals: true` in your config works, it creates hidden dependencies.\n\n### 2. Co-locate Test Files\nTo improve readability and reduce navigation overhead, keep test files close to the code they test. For example, if you have a `Button.tsx` file, place the test in the same folder as `Button.test.tsx`.\n\n### 3. Use Screen Queries\nWhen testing with React Testing Library, `screen` helps keep tests clean. Instead of destructuring returned values from render, use `screen.getByText`, `screen.getByRole`, etc. It mirrors how users see the page.\n\n### 4. Mock Strategically\nMocking is useful but easily overused. If everything is mocked, tests lose meaning and can't catch real issues. Only mock things you can't control—like API responses, local storage, or browser-specific features.(no content)Mock: fetch, localStorage, timers, third-party services. Don't mock: Your own React components or business logic.\n\n### 5. Clear Test Descriptions\nTest descriptions should explain what the test is really doing. A vague message like \"it works\" doesn't help when it fails.\n\n### 6. Create Reusable Helpers\nRepeated actions like rendering components, clicking buttons, or entering input should not be rewritten in every test. Create small helpers to handle them.\n\n## Key Differences from Jest\n\nThe API is the same as Jest, but one important difference is that in Jest it automocks every module of a file, whereas in Vitest you have to mock everything manually.(no content)Vitest does not auto-mock modules like Jest does. You manually mock modules to control behavior and use `mockResolvedValue` for testing.\n\n## CI/CD Integration\n\nTools like GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, or CircleCI can automatically run `npm run test` on pull requests. This ensures that your codebase stays clean and prevents regressions.\n\n## Testing Async Server Components\n\nSince async Server Components are new to the React ecosystem, Vitest currently does not support them. While you can still run unit tests for synchronous Server and Client Components, it's recommended to use E2E tests for async components.\n\n## Testing Types\n\nVitest also supports type testing with TypeScript using `expectTypeOf` and `assertType` APIs for validating types at test time.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"7321a8d2-5574-4780-8567-b2b887a208dc","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:00:28.365Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Vitest testing React TypeScript 2025 best practices","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01GAKLwpvTaEPTC3uj52iZXS","content":[{"title":"Vitest | Next Generation testing framework","url":"https://vitest.dev/"},{"title":"Testing: Vitest | Next.js","url":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/testing/vitest"},{"title":"Test Projects | Guide | Vitest","url":"https://vitest.dev/guide/projects"},{"title":"Vitest with TypeScript: Best Practices and Examples","url":"https://decodefix.com/vitest-with-typescript-best-practices-and-examples/"},{"title":"Getting Started | Guide | Vitest","url":"https://vitest.dev/guide/"},{"title":"React Testing with Vitest & React Testing Library | by Vasilis Kortsimelidis | Medium","url":"https://vaskort.medium.com/bulletproof-react-testing-with-vitest-rtl-deeaabce9fef"},{"title":"React Component Testing: Best Practices with Vitest and Jest (2025 Guide) | CodingEasyPeasy","url":"https://www.codingeasypeasy.com/blog/react-component-testing-best-practices-with-vitest-and-jest-2025-guide"},{"title":"Testing Types | Guide | Vitest","url":"https://vitest.dev/guide/testing-types"},{"title":"Vitest CLI: Best Practices for Efficient Testing","url":"https://runebook.dev/en/articles/vitest/guide/cli/vitest"},{"title":"Mastering TypeScript Testing: A Comprehensive Guide with Jest and Vitest – Typescriptworld","url":"https://typescriptworld.com/mastering-typescript-testing-a-comprehensive-guide-with-jest-and-vitest"}]},"Here's what I found on **Vitest testing with React and TypeScript in 2025**:\n\n## Setup and Configuration\n\nFor TypeScript React projects, you need to install packages like `vitest`, `@vitejs/plugin-react`, `jsdom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/dom`, and `vite-tsconfig-paths`.

However, CEP extensions continue to be supported, with the plan to support both CEP and UXP for a calendar year, after which support for CEP extensibility will be removed.\n\n## CEP Panel Testing Best Practices\n\n### Enabling Debug Mode\nNote that Premiere Pro 23.x integrates CEP11, so even if you had unsigned panels loading before (up to CEP10), you'll need to enable debug mode again for key CSXS.11. On MacOS, use Terminal to run: `defaults write /Users/<username>/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.CSXS.12.plist PlayerDebugMode 1` then relaunch Finder. On Windows, make a registry entry of type String.\n\n### Panel Installation Locations\nPut your panel's containing directory in these locations to have Premiere Pro load it:\n- Windows: `C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Common Files\\Adobe\\CEP\\extensions`\n- Mac: `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions`\n\n### Testing ZXP Installation\nUse the UPIA command line utility to test .zxp installation. The ZXPSignCmd signing utility creates signed .zxp bundles for Add-Ons or direct distribution.\n\n### Debugging Tools\nUse Microsoft Visual Studio Code to debug your panel's JavaScript.(no content)CEF Client is essentially a Chromium distribution of the same version at each CEP release to ensure smooth debugging with Chrome Dev Tools.\n\n### CEP Logging\nYou can turn on CEP logging for optional diagnostics. Find CEP logs (distinct from Premiere Pro's logs) at:\n- Windows: `%\\AppData\\Local\\Temp\\csxs11-PPRO.log`\n- Mac: `/Library/Logs/CSXS/csxs11-PPRO.log`\n\nNote that the Mac Library path is the system's library, not the user's, and logging WILL impact performance.\n\n### Extension Loading Order\nCEP first searches the product extension folder, then the system extension folder, and finally the per-user extension folder. Extensions without an appropriate host application ID and version are filtered out.(no content)If two extensions have the same extension bundle ID, the one with higher version is loaded. If they have the same version, the one whose manifest file has latest modification date is loaded. If they have the same version and modification date, CEP loads the first one that is found.\n\n### Cross-Platform Testing\nWhen it comes to signing panels, \"signed is signed\" - panels signed on Mac work on Windows and vice versa.\n\n### Future-Proofing\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\nFor new development, consider the UXP resources:\n- UXP samples are available at https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples, with documentation at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ and the Premiere Pro UXP Developer Forum at forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"67b7e30a-cb88-45b1-b478-55d502512f1e","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:00:31.281Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro CEP panel testing best practices 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01EM6ohMTJAkTqb9Lx8ZomPD","content":[{"title":"Premiere Pro panels - Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/ReadMe.md"},{"title":"GitHub - Adobe-CEP/Samples: Code samples for CEP extensions","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples"},{"title":"Building Adobe Extensions — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/building-adobe-extensions/"},{"title":"Samples/PProPanel at master · Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel"},{"title":"CEP Panels not visible - Adobe Product Community - 14952705","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/cep-panels-not-visible/td-p/14952705"},{"title":"ADOBE CERTIFIED PROFESSIONAL – TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE","url":"https://certiport.pearsonvue.com/Support/Install/Adobe-Program-Support/ACPro-Troubleshooting-Guide.pdf"},{"title":"Possible to improve how Premiere Pro (or CEP in ge... - Adobe Product Community - 14977354","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/possible-to-improve-how-premiere-pro-or-cep-in-general-loads-extensions/idi-p/14977354"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Re: Best route for publishing my Premiere Pro CEP Panel","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/best-route-for-publishing-my-premiere-pro-cep-panel/m-p/14594614"},{"title":"Re: How to get an Adobe Panel Extension (CEP) dev'd on MacOS for Premiere to run on Windows?","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/how-to-get-an-adobe-panel-extension-cep-dev-d-on-macos-for-premiere-to-run-on-windows/m-p/14478769/highlight/true"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about Premiere Pro CEP panel testing best practices for 2025:\n\n## Key Updates for 2025\n\nAs of November 2025 (coinciding with the Premiere Pro 25.6 release, also known as \"Premiere Pro 2025\"), CEP extensions to Premiere Pro have been superseded by UXP Extensibility.(no content)If you are starting new development, you should start in UXP.

You can use it to write End-to-End (E2E) testing.\n\n### Installation\n\nTo install Playwright, run the following command: `npm init playwright` (or `yarn create playwright` / `pnpm create playwright`). This will take you through a series of prompts to setup and configure Playwright for your project, including adding a `playwright.config.ts` file.(no content)Jumping into E2E testing with Playwright is refreshingly straightforward. Forget about manually creating config files and wrestling with directory structures. Thanks to its slick command-line interface (CLI), you can get a best-practice setup running in less than a minute.\n\n### Configuration File\n\nFirst, you'll need a general configuration file to setup Playwright testing. Create a `playwright.config.ts` in the root directory.(no content)Playwright has many options to configure how your tests are run. You can specify these options in the configuration file. Note that test runner options are top-level, do not put them into the `use` section.\n\nKey configuration options include:\n\n- `testDir`: Look for test files in the specified directory. `fullyParallel`: Run all tests in parallel. `forbidOnly`: Fail the build on CI if you accidentally left test.only in the source code.\n- `baseURL`: Base URL to use in actions like `await page.goto('/')`. `trace`: Collect trace when retrying the failed test.\n- `projects`: Configure projects for major browsers. `webServer`: Run your local dev server before starting the tests.\n\n### Recommended Project Structure\n\nUse this folder hierarchy to keep the system easy to navigate: `/tests` serves as a storage for test suites where each file relates to a specific feature or user flow. `/pages` refers to Page Object Model (POM) classes that abstract locators and actions. `/fixtures` locates reusable test fixtures such as authenticated states, browser contexts, or API mocks. `/utils` stores helper functions, reusable utilities, and custom assertions. `/config` contains environment files, specific settings, and global configuration. With this structure, you can reduce code duplication and aim for easy scalability.\n\n### Key Features and Benefits\n\nDeveloped by Microsoft, this tool provides an advanced framework that suits checking complex web applications and implementing it into continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Playwright is the best choice for E2E automation as it automates Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit within a single API.(no content)If compared to Selenium, which requires manual waiting and additional synchronization logic, Playwright has automatic waiting for events, elements, and states. When contrasted with Cypress, the instrument supports multiple browsers, enables parallel execution, and offers greater flexibility.(no content)One of the powerful features of Playwright is its ability to handle synchronization automatically. Playwright automatically waits for a wide range of actionability checks to pass before performing each action. This built-in synchronization ensures that you can focus on writing your tests without worrying about timing issues.\n\n### IDE Integration\n\nIn Visual Studio Code, install the Playwright extension for IntelliSense and debugging support.(no content)Use TypeScript for better code clarity. Use the Playwright Inspector (`npx playwright codegen`) for debugging tests. Add meaningful test scripts to `package.json` to make execution faster.\n\n### Running Tests\n\nYou can run tests with various commands: `pnpm test:e2e` (run all tests), `pnpm test:e2e:ui` (run tests with UI mode), `pnpm test:e2e tests/flow.spec.ts` (run specific test file), `pnpm test:e2e --workers=4` (run with different configurations).\n\n### Advanced Features\n\nPlaywright supports advanced features like visual comparisons with screenshots, mocking network requests, testing across different viewports and devices and much more.(no content)Component Testing: You can mount individual UI components from frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte to test them in a real browser in isolation. API Testing: The framework comes with a powerful API request context (`request`) for HTTP requests to your backend directly from your test files.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b7c64911-2052-4113-8042-88b26a01f513","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:00:33.037Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Playwright E2E testing 2025 setup configuration","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01SgNfK5BZwj5qYj9b8s9LWK","content":[{"title":"Modern E2E Testing for Angular Apps with Playwright - Angular.love","url":"https://angular.love/modern-e2e-testing-for-angular-apps-with-playwright/"},{"title":"E2E Testing with Playwright | Descope Documentation","url":"https://docs.descope.com/unit-testing/e2e-testing-guides/e2e-playwright"},{"title":"Setting Up End-to-End Testing with Playwright: Monorepo vs Standard Repository | Kyrre Gjerstad","url":"https://www.kyrre.dev/blog/end-to-end-testing-setup"},{"title":"End-to-End Automation Testing with Playwright: The Ultimate Guide","url":"https://white-test.com/for-qa/useful-articles-for-qa/playwright-e2e-testing/"},{"title":"Guide to Playwright end-to-end testing in 2025 - DeviQA","url":"https://www.deviqa.com/blog/guide-to-playwright-end-to-end-testing-in-2025/"},{"title":"How to set up E2E testing with Playwright - Resend","url":"https://resend.com/docs/knowledge-base/end-to-end-testing-with-playwright"},{"title":"E2E Testing Playwright: Your Ultimate Guide to Reliable Automation","url":"https://blog.mergify.com/e-2-e-testing-playwright/"},{"title":"Playwright End-to-End Testing: A Step-by-Step Guide | Better Stack Community","url":"https://betterstack.com/community/guides/testing/playwright-end-to-end-testing/"},{"title":"Configuration | Playwright","url":"https://playwright.dev/docs/test-configuration"},{"title":"Testing: Playwright | Next.js","url":"https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/testing/playwright"}]},"Here are the search results for Playwright E2E testing setup and configuration in 2025:\n\n## Getting Started with Playwright\n\nPlaywright is a testing framework that lets you automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API.

It is based on HTTPX, which in turn is designed based on Requests, so it's very familiar and intuitive. With it, you can use pytest directly with FastAPI.(no content)To build a reliable FastAPI testing stack, it's important to use the right tools and powerful frameworks. Start with pytest for test management and pytest-asyncio to support asynchronous operations.\n\n## TestClient Usage\n\nCreate a TestClient by passing your FastAPI application to it. Create functions with a name that starts with test_ (this is standard pytest conventions). Use the TestClient object the same way as you do with httpx.(no content)The TestClient wraps your FastAPI application, allowing you to make requests directly to your endpoints without actually running a server. This client simulates HTTP requests and captures the responses, making it easy to verify that your endpoints behave as expected.\n\n## Key Best Practices\n\n### 1. Use Fixtures Properly\nSoftware test fixtures initialize test functions. They provide a fixed baseline so that tests execute reliably and produce consistent, repeatable results. Initialization may involve setting up services, states, or other operating environments.(no content)All fixtures in Pytest should be placed in the tests/conftest.py file. conftest.py is a configuration file in Pytest that is used to define fixtures, hooks, and configuration options shared across multiple test modules. conftest.py is a place to centralize reusable test setup logic and configurations.\n\n### 2. Keep Tests Isolated and Independent\nBefore writing any tests, we want to follow the best practices of keeping tests isolated, independent and repeatable. This means tests can run in any order. It's also a good idea to abstract the implementation detail.(no content)Keep tests independent. One test should not affect another. Use clear, descriptive test names. Test both happy paths and edge cases. Mock external services like databases or APIs.\n\n### 3. Use Dependency Overrides for Database Testing\nThe good thing is we have not hardcoded the database to be used in the routes. We are making use of a dependency named 'get_db' to provide a database session. In our unit tests, we will be overriding this dependency and provide our test database instead. This concept is known as dependency injection.(no content)Smart Mocking: Simplify tests using dependency_overrides. Clean DB Testing: Use rollbacks or in-memory databases for isolated runs.\n\n### 4. Test Database Setup and Teardown\nWe create a test database in SQLite to avoid using the real database and cause side effects. The code creates a test database in SQLite and sets up the test client for the FastAPI app. We also have transaction rollback and table clean up at the end of each test.\n\n### 5. Async Testing Support\nFastAPI Async Testing: Handle async routes with httpx and pytest-asyncio.(no content)Tools like httpx.AsyncClient and TestClient simulate real HTTP requests, useful for testing both simple endpoints and complex validation.\n\n### 6. Test Error Conditions\nEffective API tests should be isolated from external dependencies, cover typical usage scenarios, test error conditions to ensure graceful failure, and verify expected responses, including status codes and data formats.\n\n### 7. Use Mocking for External Services\nMocking involves creating simulated objects that mimic the behavior of real objects. Mocks are commonly used to replace external services, databases, or complex components that are difficult to control in an isolated test environment.\n\n### 8. CI/CD Integration\nCI Integration: Automate testing with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI.(no content)Tests should run automatically. Use a CI/CD pipeline. Every code push can trigger your test suite. This ensures quality.\n\n### 9. Coverage Testing\nIntegrating coverage testing with PyTest in FastAPI projects is essential for assessing the effectiveness of test suites and identifying areas that require additional testing. To integrate coverage testing with PyTest, you can use the pytest-cov plugin.\n\n### 10. Use Model Factories for Test Data\nCreate model Factories to simplify the creation of test data in the database. For example, creating a user in the database using a factory like user: User = UserFactory(). Just one line without arguments will create a user with realistic random data in the database.\n\n## Summary\n\nThe modern approach to FastAPI testing combines pytest with TestClient, uses fixtures for setup/teardown, implements dependency injection for database isolation, and integrates with CI/CD pipelines for automated testing. These practices ensure your APIs are reliable, maintainable, and production-ready.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"89febefc-5c42-4fff-ae37-c4de9f018b2b","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:00:41.232Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"pytest FastAPI testing 2025 best practices","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0112v3Nb83Gr5uanmD6ce2hQ","content":[{"title":"Testing - FastAPI","url":"https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/testing/"},{"title":"What Is FastAPI Testing?

These documentation UIs read the OpenAPI schema generated by FastAPI and provide a fully interactive interface for exploring and testing your API.\n\n### Key Features\n\nIn 2025, FastAPI remains one of the top three most-used Python web frameworks, known for its async speed, Pydantic validation, and type-safe architecture.(no content)Its key features include auto-generated documentation with OpenAPI + Swagger built in, type hints and validation powered by Pydantic, async performance handling thousands of concurrent requests, and enterprise-ready speed.\n\n### How It Works\n\nFastAPI automatically generates detailed API docs using Swagger UI and ReDoc. FastAPI leverages Python type hints and Pydantic models to produce an OpenAPI specification, which forms the backbone of the documentation.(no content)The process is fairly straightforward: FastAPI builds the OpenAPI document based on the routes and models you've defined in your application. For every route in your FastAPI application, FastAPI adds an operation to the OpenAPI document. For every model used in these routes, FastAPI adds a schema definition. The request and response bodies, parameters, and headers all draw from these schema definitions.\n\n### Documentation Endpoints\n\nOut of the box, FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI 3.0 schema, and serves it through Swagger UI at /docs, and ReDoc at /redoc. No plugin. No setup.(no content)When you run a FastAPI application and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs, you'll see the automatic interactive API documentation provided by Swagger UI. Similarly, http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc provides an alternative documentation interface using ReDoc.\n\n### Customization Options\n\nFastAPI is renowned for its automatic generation of interactive API documentation, powered by the OpenAPI specification.

These documentation UIs read the OpenAPI schema generated by FastAPI and provide a fully interactive interface for exploring and testing your API.\n\n### Key Features\n\nIn 2025, FastAPI remains one of the top three most-used Python web frameworks, known for its async speed, Pydantic validation, and type-safe architecture.(no content)Its key features include auto-generated documentation with OpenAPI + Swagger built in, type hints and validation powered by Pydantic, async performance handling thousands of concurrent requests, and enterprise-ready speed.\n\n### How It Works\n\nFastAPI automatically generates detailed API docs using Swagger UI and ReDoc. FastAPI leverages Python type hints and Pydantic models to produce an OpenAPI specification, which forms the backbone of the documentation.(no content)The process is fairly straightforward: FastAPI builds the OpenAPI document based on the routes and models you've defined in your application. For every route in your FastAPI application, FastAPI adds an operation to the OpenAPI document. For every model used in these routes, FastAPI adds a schema definition. The request and response bodies, parameters, and headers all draw from these schema definitions.\n\n### Documentation Endpoints\n\nOut of the box, FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI 3.0 schema, and serves it through Swagger UI at /docs, and ReDoc at /redoc. No plugin. No setup.(no content)When you run a FastAPI application and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs, you'll see the automatic interactive API documentation provided by Swagger UI. Similarly, http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc provides an alternative documentation interface using ReDoc.\n\n### Customization Options\n\nFastAPI is renowned for its automatic generation of interactive API documentation, powered by the OpenAPI specification. Out of the box, FastAPI provides intuitive Swagger UI (`/docs`) and ReDoc (`/redoc`) interfaces that reflect your API code — routes, parameters, request bodies, and response models. While this default auto-doc generation is powerful, real-world APIs often require advanced customizations: customizing metadata like title, description, and version; grouping and tagging endpoints for better navigation; adding rich descriptions, examples, and deprecations; overriding or extending the OpenAPI schema for third-party integrations.\n\n### Alternative Documentation UIs\n\nIn addition to the default options, Scalar is an alternative to Swagger UI.

This gives you the correlation you need for true observability. A practical example can use a FastAPI middleware that will automatically grab the current trace_id and span_id and add them to the logging context for the duration of the request.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nUse JSON Format: JSON logs are easier to parse and integrate with log management tools.

With MSW, you can intercept outgoing requests, observe them, and respond to them using mocked responses.\n\n### Key Features:\n- MSW uses the Service Worker API to intercept actual production requests on the network level. Instead of patching fetch and meddling with your application's integrity, MSW bets on the platform, utilizing the standard browser API to implement a revolutionary request interception logic.\n- MSW is designed to be fully environment-, framework- and tool-agnostic. You can use it in any browser or Node.js process without additional configurations, adapters, or plugins.\n- You can reuse the same mock definition for the unit, integration, and E2E testing.\n\n### Use Cases:\nMSW's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of testing scenarios: Unit and Integration Tests, Storybook Component Development (integrate MSW with Storybook to provide realistic static data for your components), End-to-End Tests (Cypress, Playwright, Selenium), and Local Development with Hot Module Reloading with tools like Vite or Webpack Dev Server.\n\n## Mirage JS\n\nMirage is an API mocking library that lets you build, test and share a complete working JavaScript application without having to rely on any backend services. Mirage is centered around data modeling to emulate more complex server behaviors.(no content)Mirage JS is a client-side mocking library for JavaScript frameworks. It's designed for frontend development without backend dependencies.\n\n## Key Differences Between MSW and Mirage\n\nMSW is a mocking library that can run in the browser or node. While Mirage and MSW both run in the client alongside your frontend code, the main difference is that MSW uses a Service Worker to intercept network requests, whereas Mirage uses Pretender.js which works by monkey-patching window.fetch and window.XMLHttpRequest.

With MSW, you can intercept outgoing requests, observe them, and respond to them using mocked responses.\n\n### Key Features:\n- MSW uses the Service Worker API to intercept actual production requests on the network level. Instead of patching fetch and meddling with your application's integrity, MSW bets on the platform, utilizing the standard browser API to implement a revolutionary request interception logic.\n- MSW is designed to be fully environment-, framework- and tool-agnostic. You can use it in any browser or Node.js process without additional configurations, adapters, or plugins.\n- You can reuse the same mock definition for the unit, integration, and E2E testing.\n\n### Use Cases:\nMSW's versatility makes it suitable for a wide range of testing scenarios: Unit and Integration Tests, Storybook Component Development (integrate MSW with Storybook to provide realistic static data for your components), End-to-End Tests (Cypress, Playwright, Selenium), and Local Development with Hot Module Reloading with tools like Vite or Webpack Dev Server.\n\n## Mirage JS\n\nMirage is an API mocking library that lets you build, test and share a complete working JavaScript application without having to rely on any backend services. Mirage is centered around data modeling to emulate more complex server behaviors.(no content)Mirage JS is a client-side mocking library for JavaScript frameworks. It's designed for frontend development without backend dependencies.\n\n## Key Differences Between MSW and Mirage\n\nMSW is a mocking library that can run in the browser or node. While Mirage and MSW both run in the client alongside your frontend code, the main difference is that MSW uses a Service Worker to intercept network requests, whereas Mirage uses Pretender.js which works by monkey-patching window.fetch and window.XMLHttpRequest. The main advantage of using a Service Worker is that requests are shown in the Network tab of the DevTools – they're real HTTP requests from the perspective of the browser.(no content)MSW is a great library and the service worker concept might even make it into Mirage at some point, but mocking every endpoint by hand is tedious and hard to maintain over time. Having some conventions around your mocks and ensuring that they maintain the referential integrity of your data as your JavaScript app makes read and write requests is the reason Mirage was created in the first place.\n\n## Other API Simulation Tools (2025)\n\nAPI simulation tools have become indispensable in modern development and testing workflows.

Users report it's \"wonderfully fast\" and you will need to install the Apple Silicon version of VSCode to take advantage of it.(no content)The Apple Silicon version has already been released and can be downloaded from https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/releases.\n\n### Installation Note\nTo install, open the Extensions nav (Cmd + Shift + E) and uninstall the previous version, then install the .vsix file by dropping it onto the application window.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nEither head to the extension marketplace link and install from there, or search \"ExtendScript Debugger\" within VS Code's extension browser and install. If you're going the latter route, make sure you're installing the one from Adobe!(no content)To use the extension, you need to create a debug task for VS Code to run when you want to debug ExtendScript. This creates a config for VSCode's debugger that attaches to the host app of your choice.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- VSCode can automatically begin debugging when a debugger statement is encountered in your scripts.\n- For those who need to export JSXBIN files, this plugin also provides that functionality.\n- Click on the status bar button labelled \"▷ Eval in host app name\" to launch the current script. If the script throws any errors, you'll be able to view variables & a call stack.\n\n## Important Notes\n\nPlease uninstall any previous extensions related to ExtendScript as those extensions can conflict with breakpoints functionality. VSCode ESDebugger extension and ESTK application can't run simultaneously.\n\n## The Future: UXP\n\nThe shift from ExtendScript and CEP to UXP in Adobe Creative Cloud marks a pivotal evolution in plugin development, embracing modern web technologies.

Drop in your Redis connection and get a full-featured dashboard with job retries, status insights, and more.(no content)Instantly visualize all your Redis jobs—active, failed, delayed, and completed. Monitor queue performance in real-time with the BullMQ dashboard.(no content)Unlike Bull-board which requires self-hosting and integration into your application, Kuue is a hosted solution—just connect your Redis and start monitoring. No code changes or deployment required.\n\n### 3. **Arena**\nArena is an intuitive Web GUI for Bee Queue, Bull and BullMQ. Built on Express so you can run Arena standalone, or mounted in another app as middleware.\n\n### 4. **Bull Monitor**\nBull Monitor offers automatic discovery of your bull queues (just point it at your Redis instance), automatic configuration of Prometheus metrics for each discovered queue, and configurable UI support to visualize bull queues (supported: arena, bull-board, bull-master).(no content)You can visualize your queue metrics in Grafana! This requires bull-monitor to be running with its /metrics endpoint accessible, Prometheus configured to scrape bull-monitor, and Grafana set up to scrape data from Prometheus.\n\n### 5. **Taskforce.sh** (Official BullMQ Pro)\nAs your queues grow and your system becomes larger, it is important to have a good overview of what is going on. You can use BullMQ with Taskforce.sh to gain better insights in your queues and powerful debugging and monitoring tools to manage your jobs.\n\n### Built-in BullMQ Metrics\nBullMQ provides a simple metrics gathering functionality that allows you to track the performance of your queues.

On Windows, open regedit > HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Adobe/CSXS.8, then add a new entry PlayerDebugMode of type \"string\" with the value of \"1\". On Mac, in the Terminal, type: `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.8 PlayerDebugMode 1`\n\n### Creating a .debug File\n\nAdobe provides a built-in debugger for their apps. To enable this, create a .debug file at the root of your repository.(no content)List the Host IDs for each app your extension supports, with a corresponding port of your choosing for debugging. The full list of host application ports is available in the CEP Cookbook.\n\n### Accessing Chrome DevTools\n\nWith your .debug file in your Extension Bundle folder, and one of the specified Host apps running, you can navigate to http://localhost:<DEBUG_PORT> in your browser to see the debugger for that extension running in the specified app.(no content)Open Chrome and go to http://localhost:8088/ or whichever port you set in your .debug file. If your panel is working, you'll see the name of your extension as a link you can click on. The link will take you to the JavaScript Console within Chromium DevTools, where you will see your extension's log and error output.\n\n### CEF Client for Debugging\n\nCEF Client is essentially a Chromium distribution of the same version at each CEP release to ensure smooth debugging with Chrome Dev Tools. You can find the CEF Client in the version of CEP you're developing for.(no content)Debugging the JavaScript Layer (Chromium + Node.js) is accomplished with Chrome Dev Tools which comes with a massive suite of tools for advanced code debugging. Since the latest version of Chrome doesn't always match the CEP version, Adobe distributes a special build of Chromium for each CEP release called the CEF Client.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf your debug console in Chrome appears blank, check the contents of your .debug file: Does your extension ID in the .debug file match what's in manifest.xml? Are you listing the supported host app(s) correctly with the right Host ID(s)? Are you attempting to access localhost on the same port that you have indicated in your debug console?\n\n### Dual Debugging Approach\n\nCEP Extension / ES6 debugging is done in Chrome Dev Tools, while ExtendScript / ES3 debugging is done in VS Code with Adobe's ExtendScript debugger extension. You can run these both at the same time if you like.(no content)If this is your first time debugging an Adobe extension, you may have to re-start your machine before running your development server, otherwise you might not see any debug logs.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"733370c2-0426-42a3-8141-767094dab3ae","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:02:21.461Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Chrome DevTools CEP panel debugging Adobe extension 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Qw4zJUVHJURfHQVNfVBzuw","content":[{"title":"Solved: Debugging CEP panel creation. - Adobe Product Community - 10557634","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/exchange-discussions/debugging-cep-panel-creation/td-p/10557634"},{"title":"Using web technologies to build Adobe extensions | Theodo","url":"https://blog.theodo.com/2025/building-adobe-extensions/"},{"title":"Getting-Started-guides/Client-side Debugging/readme.md at master · Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/blob/master/Client-side%20Debugging/readme.md"},{"title":"Adobe Experience Platform Debugger Extension | Adobe Experience Platform","url":"https://experienceleague.adobe.com/en/docs/experience-platform/debugger/home"},{"title":"Getting-Started-guides/Client-side Debugging at master · Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/tree/master/Client-side%20Debugging"},{"title":"Building Adobe Extensions — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/building-adobe-extensions/"},{"title":"VSCode Extendscript Debugger: Issues Debugging CEP Panel","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/vscode-extendscript-debugger-issues-debugging-cep-panel/td-p/14801244"},{"title":"Adobe CEP extension panel debugger via localhost:[port]","url":"https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=659253"},{"title":"CEP Remote debugging is not working. - Adobe Product Community - 8841734","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/after-effects-discussions/cep-remote-debugging-is-not-working/td-p/8841734"},{"title":"Adobe Experience Platform Debugger - Chrome Web Store","url":"https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/adobe-experience-platform/bfnnokhpnncpkdmbokanobigaccjkpob"}]},"Here's what I found about debugging Adobe CEP (Common Extensibility Platform) panel extensions using Chrome DevTools:\n\n## Setting Up Debugging for CEP Extensions\n\n### Prerequisites\n\nFirst, set the Adobe preference to prevent your host application (Photoshop, InDesign, etc.) from throwing alerts about unsigned extensions.

Let me compile a detailed architectural recommendation document.\n\n# Comprehensive Architecture for Testing, Debugging, and DevOps Infrastructure\n\n## Premiere Pro Plugin + Web App System\n\nBased on my research, here are architectural recommendations for your Premiere Pro plugin and web app system.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Testing Strategy\n\n### Unit Tests\n\n**JavaScript/TypeScript (Vitest - Recommended)**\n\nVitest is the recommended choice for 2025, offering unified configuration with Vite and superior performance.\n\n```typescript\n// vitest.config.ts\nimport { defineConfig } from 'vitest/config'\nimport react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'\nimport tsconfigPaths from 'vite-tsconfig-paths'\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  plugins: [tsconfigPaths(), react()],\n  test: {\n    environment: 'jsdom',\n    globals: false, // Prefer explicit imports\n    coverage: {\n      provider: 'v8',\n      reporter: ['text', 'json', 'html'],\n    },\n    include: ['src/**/*.{test,spec}.{js,ts,tsx}'],\n  },\n})\n```\n\nKey practices:\n- Co-locate test files with source code (e.g., `Button.tsx` and `Button.test.tsx`)\n- Use explicit imports for test functions (`import { describe, it, expect } from 'vitest'`)\n- Mock strategically: only mock fetch, localStorage, timers, third-party services - not your own components\n\n**Python (pytest)**\n\n```python\n# conftest.py\nimport pytest\nfrom fastapi.testclient import TestClient\nfrom sqlalchemy import create_engine\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker\nfrom app.main import app\nfrom app.database import get_db, Base\n\nSQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = \"sqlite:///./test.db\"\nengine = create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL, connect_args={\"check_same_thread\": False})\nTestingSessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)\n\n@pytest.fixture(scope=\"function\")\ndef db():\n    Base.metadata.create_all(bind=engine)\n    db = TestingSessionLocal()\n    try:\n        yield db\n    finally:\n        db.close()\n        Base.metadata.drop_all(bind=engine)\n\n@pytest.fixture\ndef client(db):\n    def override_get_db():\n        yield db\n    app.dependency_overrides[get_db] = override_get_db\n    with TestClient(app) as c:\n        yield c\n    app.dependency_overrides.clear()\n```\n\n### Integration Tests for API Endpoints\n\n```python\n# tests/test_api.py\nimport pytest\nfrom httpx import AsyncClient\n\n@pytest.mark.asyncio\nasync def test_create_music_job(client):\n    response = client.post(\n        \"/api/v1/jobs\",\n        json={\"prompt\": \"upbeat electronic music\", \"duration\": 30}\n    )\n    assert response.status_code == 201\n    data = response.json()\n    assert \"job_id\" in data\n    assert data[\"status\"] == \"pending\"\n```\n\n### E2E Tests (Playwright - Recommended)\n\n```typescript\n// playwright.config.ts\nimport { defineConfig, devices } from '@playwright/test';\n\nexport default defineConfig({\n  testDir: './tests/e2e',\n  fullyParallel: true,\n  forbidOnly: !!process.env.CI,\n  retries: process.env.CI ? 2 : 0,\n  workers: process.env.CI ? 1 : undefined,\n  reporter: 'html',\n  use: {\n    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3000',\n    trace: 'on-first-retry',\n  },\n  projects: [\n    { name: 'chromium', use: { ...devices['Desktop Chrome'] } },\n    { name: 'firefox', use: { ...devices['Desktop Firefox'] } },\n    { name: 'webkit', use: { ...devices['Desktop Safari'] } },\n  ],\n  webServer: {\n    command: 'npm run dev',\n    url: 'http://localhost:3000',\n    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,\n  },\n});\n```\n\n### CEP Panel Testing\n\nCEP panel testing is limited but possible through several approaches:\n\n1. **Unit test business logic separately** - Extract logic into testable modules\n2. **Chrome DevTools debugging** - Create a `.debug` file:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<ExtensionList>\n  <Extension Id=\"com.yourcompany.suno-panel\">\n    <HostList>\n      <Host Name=\"PPRO\" Port=\"8088\"/>\n    </HostList>\n  </Extension>\n</ExtensionList>\n```\n\nAccess debugger at `http://localhost:8088` while Premiere Pro is running.\n\n**Note (2025):** Adobe has announced UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform) as the successor to CEP, with plans to deprecate CEP by September 2026. Consider UXP for new development.\n\n### Mock Suno API Server\n\nUse **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** for API mocking:\n\n```typescript\n// mocks/handlers.ts\nimport { http, HttpResponse } from 'msw'\n\nexport const handlers = [\n  http.post('https://api.suno.ai/v1/generate', async ({ request }) => {\n    const body = await request.json()\n    return HttpResponse.json({\n      id: 'mock-job-id-123',\n      status: 'processing',\n      prompt: body.prompt,\n      created_at: new Date().toISOString(),\n    })\n  }),\n  \n  http.get('https://api.suno.ai/v1/jobs/:jobId', ({ params }) => {\n    return HttpResponse.json({\n      id: params.jobId,\n      status: 'completed',\n      audio_url: 'https://mock.suno.ai/audio/sample.mp3',\n      duration: 30,\n    })\n  }),\n]\n\n// mocks/server.ts (for Node.js/testing)\nimport { setupServer } from 'msw/node'\nimport { handlers } from './handlers'\nexport const server = setupServer(...handlers)\n\n// mocks/browser.ts (for browser/development)\nimport { setupWorker } from 'msw/browser'\nimport { handlers } from './handlers'\nexport const worker = setupWorker(...handlers)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2.

Monitoring and Observability\n\n### Structured Logging (structlog)\n\n```python\n# app/logging_config.py\nimport structlog\nimport logging\nimport sys\n\ndef configure_logging(json_logs: bool = False):\n    shared_processors = [\n        structlog.contextvars.merge_contextvars,\n        structlog.stdlib.add_logger_name,\n        structlog.stdlib.add_log_level,\n        structlog.stdlib.PositionalArgumentsFormatter(),\n        structlog.processors.TimeStamper(fmt=\"iso\"),\n        structlog.processors.StackInfoRenderer(),\n        structlog.processors.UnicodeDecoder(),\n    ]\n\n    if json_logs:\n        processors = shared_processors + [\n            structlog.processors.format_exc_info,\n            structlog.processors.JSONRenderer(),\n        ]\n    else:\n        processors = shared_processors + [\n            structlog.dev.ConsoleRenderer(),\n        ]\n\n    structlog.configure(\n        processors=processors,\n        wrapper_class=structlog.stdlib.BoundLogger,\n        context_class=dict,\n        logger_factory=structlog.stdlib.LoggerFactory(),\n        cache_logger_on_first_use=True,\n    )\n\n# Usage\nlogger = structlog.get_logger()\nlogger.info(\"job_started\", job_id=\"123\", prompt=\"upbeat music\")\n```\n\n### Sentry Integration\n\n```python\n# app/main.py\nimport sentry_sdk\nfrom sentry_sdk.integrations.fastapi import FastApiIntegration\nfrom sentry_sdk.integrations.starlette import StarletteIntegration\n\nsentry_sdk.init(\n    dsn=settings.sentry_dsn,\n    integrations=[\n        StarletteIntegration(),\n        FastApiIntegration(),\n    ],\n    traces_sample_rate=0.1,  # 10% of transactions\n    profiles_sample_rate=0.1,\n    environment=settings.environment,\n)\n```\n\n```typescript\n// web/src/lib/sentry.ts\nimport * as Sentry from '@sentry/react';\n\nSentry.init({\n  dsn: import.meta.env.VITE_SENTRY_DSN,\n  integrations: [\n    Sentry.browserTracingIntegration(),\n    Sentry.replayIntegration(),\n  ],\n  tracesSampleRate: 0.1,\n  replaysSessionSampleRate: 0.1,\n  replaysOnErrorSampleRate: 1.0,\n});\n```\n\n### Job Queue Monitoring\n\nUse **Bull Board** for queue visualization:\n\n```typescript\n// api/src/bull-board.ts\nimport { createBullBoard } from '@bull-board/api';\nimport { BullMQAdapter } from '@bull-board/api/bullMQAdapter';\nimport { ExpressAdapter } from '@bull-board/express';\nimport { musicGenerationQueue } from './queues';\n\nconst serverAdapter = new ExpressAdapter();\nserverAdapter.setBasePath('/admin/queues');\n\ncreateBullBoard({\n  queues: [new BullMQAdapter(musicGenerationQueue)],\n  serverAdapter,\n});\n\nexport { serverAdapter };\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Debugging Tools\n\n### Chrome DevTools for CEP Panels\n\n1. Create `.debug` file in extension root\n2. Launch Premiere Pro\n3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8088` in Chrome\n4. Use Network tab to inspect API calls\n5. Console shows all extension logs\n\n### VS Code ExtendScript Debugger\n\nInstall the **ExtendScript Debugger** extension from Adobe (updated for Apple Silicon in 2025):\n\n```json\n// .vscode/launch.json\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"extendscript-debug\",\n      \"request\": \"launch\",\n      \"name\": \"Debug ExtendScript\",\n      \"program\": \"${workspaceFolder}/jsx/main.jsx\",\n      \"targetSpecifier\": \"premierepro-22.0\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Network Request Inspection\n\nFor CEP panels, requests appear in Chrome DevTools Network tab. For the API:\n\n```python\n# Middleware for request logging\nfrom starlette.middleware.base import BaseHTTPMiddleware\nimport structlog\n\nclass RequestLoggingMiddleware(BaseHTTPMiddleware):\n    async def dispatch(self, request, call_next):\n        logger = structlog.get_logger()\n        logger.info(\n            \"request_started\",\n            method=request.method,\n            path=request.url.path,\n        )\n        response = await call_next(request)\n        logger.info(\n            \"request_completed\",\n            method=request.method,\n            path=request.url.path,\n            status_code=response.status_code,\n        )\n        return response\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6.
