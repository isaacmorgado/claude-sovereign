This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment, and you just need to require() the appropriate modules to access the APIs you need.\n\n### Two API Types\n\nThe UXP platform provides two complementary sets of APIs: UXP Core APIs for building user interfaces, file operations, network calls, and general functionality, and Premiere APIs for interacting with and modifying Premiere projects and sequences. Most often than not, you will need to use both APIs together to create the functionality you want.\n\n### Unified Environment vs. CEP's Split Architecture\n\nUXP Plugins are JavaScript/HTML/CSS based, however they are built on their own unique stack by Adobe which makes them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack. Additionally instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has 1 unified environment for your frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction back and forth.\n\n### Host Object Access\n\nPremiere APIs, also interchangeably called DOM APIs (Document Object Model) or Premiere DOM APIs, give you direct access to Premiere's document model. These APIs let you access and modify projects — sequences, tracks, clips, and markers; work with media — import files, manage project items; control playback — set in/out points, control the playhead; and apply effects — add video and audio effects to clips.\n\n### Version Compatibility\n\nUXP version (v8.1) determines which UXP Core APIs are available. Each Premiere release integrates a specific UXP version.

This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment, and you just need to require() the appropriate modules to access the APIs you need.\n\n### Two API Types\n\nThe UXP platform provides two complementary sets of APIs: UXP Core APIs for building user interfaces, file operations, network calls, and general functionality, and Premiere APIs for interacting with and modifying Premiere projects and sequences. Most often than not, you will need to use both APIs together to create the functionality you want.\n\n### Unified Environment vs. CEP's Split Architecture\n\nUXP Plugins are JavaScript/HTML/CSS based, however they are built on their own unique stack by Adobe which makes them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack. Additionally instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has 1 unified environment for your frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction back and forth.\n\n### Host Object Access\n\nPremiere APIs, also interchangeably called DOM APIs (Document Object Model) or Premiere DOM APIs, give you direct access to Premiere's document model. These APIs let you access and modify projects — sequences, tracks, clips, and markers; work with media — import files, manage project items; control playback — set in/out points, control the playhead; and apply effects — add video and audio effects to clips.\n\n### Version Compatibility\n\nUXP version (v8.1) determines which UXP Core APIs are available. Each Premiere release integrates a specific UXP version. For example, Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.\n\n### Future Capabilities\n\nUXP has the unique ability of including a C++ Hybrid plugin aspect to run computationally heavy tasks or interact with a host app's C++ APIs directly from the plugin. Note that UXP Hybrid plugins are not yet implemented in Premiere Pro but will be in the future.\n\n### Development Tools\n\nThe UXP Developer Tool (UDT) simplifies the process of creating, loading, managing, and debugging plugins for Adobe's UXP-powered applications. UXP plugins are supported in Premiere v25.6 and later since UDT v2.2."],"durationSeconds":27.405199083}}

Permissions not explicitly declared will be denied by default.\n\n### Key Manifest Requirements\n\nEach UXP plugin must have one manifest.json file that the host application uses to load and manage the plugin. In addition to core metadata such as the plugin's name, version, icons, and entry points, the manifest specifies permissions, compatibility details, and other definitions that shape how the plugin integrates with the host environment.(no content)Premiere supports manifest version \"5\".\n\n### Permission Types\n\nThe manifest indicates the various permissions a plugin requires before accessing certain API surfaces. Without them, access may fail or throw an error.\n\n**Clipboard Access:**\nEnables the plugin to read and write to the clipboard. Options include: read (enables reading from clipboard), readAndWrite (enables reading and writing to clipboard). Default value is undefined (no clipboard access).\n\n**User Consent:**\nUsers will be asked for their consent when your plugin attempts to use openExternal(), openPath(), and `<sp-link>` anchor tags. For everything else, consent is given at install time.\n\n### File System Sandbox\n\nAccessing locations outside the sandbox is possible in UXP but you will need to seek permission first. For file system access you require permission for the localFileSystem module.(no content)UXP provides a shorthand representation of these locations via schemes. For sandbox, you can use plugin:/, plugin-data:/, and plugin-temp:/. And, for other locations, use file:/.(no content)Despite the manifest setting fullAccess, certain files and folders may still not be accessible. It depends on the permission of the Operating System.\n\n### Network Permissions\n\nPermission-based APIs also need to be allow-listed in your plugin's manifest.json. For example, to use the file system or make network requests, you must declare the appropriate permissions.(no content)A common issue developers encounter is: \"Plugin is not permitted to access the network apis. A valid domains entry is required in requiredPermissions.network field of the manifest.\"\n\n### Best Practices\n\nMake sure you configure the most accurate permission for your use case because in the future users will be asked to provide their consent based on it. For example, for file operations, you may find \"fullAccess\" to be the least restrictive and hence the easiest to pick, but a user may not be comfortable giving full access to their system unless it's absolutely necessary; they might deny the installation of your plugin altogether.\n\n### Installation & Permissions\n\nDepending on the specific access level the plugin requires (for example, to the Network or the Local FileSystem), users may need to grant administrative privileges to the plugin. Once the installation is complete, the plugin will be available in the Plugins section of the Creative Cloud Desktop application.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a4ab8df5-9ff2-48d7-a0bf-0b3cb5bdc29c","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:58:14.916Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"UXP Premiere Pro sandbox security restrictions permissions manifest","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01UJWQbuhjmwS8utzpx836xH","content":[{"title":"UXP Manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"UXP Manifest v5","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v5/"},{"title":"Manifest for scripts and plugins","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/resources/fundamentals/manifest/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #13 Manifest v5 | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/Adobe-UXP-things-you-need-to-know-manifest-5.html"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"Issue with manifest v>5: domain permissions (fetch error) - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/issue-with-manifest-v-5-domain-permissions-fetch-error/4714"},{"title":"Premiere Pro 25.6.3 UXP Issue: Unable to Make Requ... - Adobe Product Community - 15622477","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-bugs/premiere-pro-25-6-3-uxp-issue-unable-to-make-requests-with-http-urls-vs-https/idi-p/15622477"},{"title":"File operations","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/resources/recipes/file-operation/"},{"title":"Install a UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/install/"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about UXP Premiere Pro sandbox security restrictions, permissions, and manifest:\n\n## UXP Manifest Permissions System\n\nTo ensure that plugins are secure, UXP requires that plugins declare the permissions they need to function.

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)UXP is not a full-blown browser or server-side JS engine like NodeJS. Though it allows you to use the same syntax, it does not intend to behave like a browser and consequently will support only a subset of the web APIs. This means, not all the HTML Elements or CSS classes or JavaScript APIs will be available in the UXP world.\n\n### Async/Await and Promises\n\nUXP scripts expect your code to be synchronous. To make it work, we need to make the thread wait for the async task to finish before continuing with the next statement. We can attain this by using Promise and await.(no content)As opposed to ExtendScript, in UXP you have a number of functions that return promises so either you use then callbacks or you use await and async.\n\n### Premiere Pro API Examples\n\nThe TypeScript definitions show many methods return Promises, such as:\n- `getSequenceVideoTimeDisplayFormat(): Promise<TimeDisplay>`, `getSequenceAudioTimeDisplayFormat(): Promise<TimeDisplay>`, `getPlayerPosition(): Promise<TickTime>`, and `setPlayerPosition(positionTime?: TickTime): Promise<boolean>`\n- `getInPoint(): Promise<TickTime>` returns a TickTime object representing the track item in point, and `getOutPoint(): Promise<TickTime>` returns a TickTime object representing the track item out point.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nWhen using array methods like map and forEach with async/await, there may be problems, so it's recommended to use for loops in these cases.(no content)The Premiere Pro UXP documentation recommends understanding Promise and Async/await as helpful additional topics.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5ca89c02-63f0-4cfd-89ab-7a0dd5804c9f","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:59:47.203Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"UXP\" \"Premiere Pro\" async await Promise synchronous properties methods","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01QofwZougLEpWT4K56KW5e9","content":[{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"Global await on scripts","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/scripts/concepts/global-await/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #5 Sync vs. Async code in Photoshop DOM Scripting | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/adobe-uxp-things-you-need-to-know-5-async-vs-sync-in-photoshop-dom-scripting"},{"title":"Sync Async","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/javascript-and-xd/sync-async/"},{"title":"XD Plugin Lab: Part Four, Step 2: File I/O · GitHub","url":"https://gist.github.com/kerrishotts/63051639d191dad49992ae3ebe900d77"},{"title":"Any Reason Not To Always Use Async - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/any-reason-not-to-always-use-async/3422"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Prerequisites for UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/tech-stack/"},{"title":"Can you not return values from async functions? - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/can-you-not-return-values-from-async-functions/595"},{"title":"uxp-premiere-pro/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about UXP in Premiere Pro regarding async/await, Promises, and synchronous properties/methods:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Premiere Pro UXP API Design\n\nIn UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread.(no content)For a smooth transition between the ExtendScript DOM and the UXP DOM, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### UXP Platform Overview\n\nUXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications.

Let me compile this research.\n\n---\n\n# UXP Communication Architecture with Adobe Premiere Pro\n\n## 1. How UXP Communicates with the Host Application (Premiere Pro)\n\n### Direct Native Communication (No Bridge)\n\nUXP provides a **unified JavaScript engine** that has direct access to both Premiere APIs and UXP Core APIs. This is fundamentally different from the previous CEP (Common Extensibility Platform) architecture.\n\n**Key architectural differences from CEP:**\n\n| Aspect | CEP (Legacy) | UXP (Current) |\n|--------|--------------|---------------|\n| JavaScript Engine | Two engines (Chromium + ExtendScript) | Single V8 engine |\n| Communication | CSInterface bridge passing messages/strings | Direct native access |\n| UI Rendering | HTML rendered as-is | HTML parsed and converted to native UI components |\n| Performance | Heavier (Node.js + Chromium stack) | Lighter weight |\n\nWith UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment. You use `require()` to import the appropriate modules and directly access host APIs. There is no boundary between JavaScript and ExtendScript that requires passing strings back and forth.\n\n### V8 JavaScript Engine\n\nUXP uses the **V8 JavaScript engine** (the same engine used in Chrome and Node.js), supporting ES6+ syntax. This replaces ExtendScript's ES3-based engine.\n\n---\n\n## 2. The Role of the \"Host\" Object in UXP for Premiere\n\n### Accessing the Premiere DOM\n\nThe Premiere DOM (Document Object Model) is accessed via a JavaScript module using `require()`:\n\n```javascript\nconst premierepro = require('premierepro');\nconst Application = premierepro.Application;\n```\n\nTo get the application instance:\n\n```javascript\nconst app = await Application.getApplication();\n```\n\n**Note:** The pattern `await new Application()` has been reported to return objects with undefined `.project` properties. The recommended pattern uses `Application.getApplication()` or similar factory methods from the official samples.\n\n### Two API Categories\n\n1. **UXP Core APIs** - Shared across all Adobe Creative Cloud applications:\n   - UI components (Spectrum Web Components)\n   - File system operations\n   - Network requests\n   - Clipboard access\n   - Storage APIs\n\n2. **Premiere DOM APIs** - Specific to Premiere Pro:\n   - Project management (open, save, close projects)\n   - Sequence manipulation (tracks, clips, markers)\n   - Media operations (import, manage project items)\n   - Playback control (in/out points, playhead position)\n   - Effects and transitions\n\n### Available Classes\n\nKey classes in the Premiere DOM include:\n- `Application` - Entry point to the API\n- `Project`, `ProjectItem`, `ClipProjectItem`, `FolderItem`\n- `Sequence`, `SequenceSettings`\n- `VideoTrack`, `AudioTrack`, `CaptionTrack`\n- `VideoClipTrackItem`, `AudioClipTrackItem`\n- `VideoFilterFactory`, `AudioFilterFactory`, `TransitionFactory`\n- `EventManager` - For event handling\n- `EncoderManager` - For AME export operations\n- `TickTime` - Timeline measurements with arithmetic operations\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Call Premiere Pro Scripting APIs from UXP JavaScript\n\n### Module Loading Pattern\n\n```javascript\n// Import the premierepro module\nconst premierepro = require('premierepro');\n\n// Access specific classes\nconst Application = premierepro.Application;\nconst Constants = premierepro.Constants;\n\n// Get the application instance\nasync function getApp() {\n    const app = await Application.getApplication();\n    return app;\n}\n```\n\n### Global vs Module-Based APIs\n\n- **Global APIs** - Available immediately without import\n- **Module-based APIs** - Require importing with `require()`\n\nThe Premiere DOM is **only available as a JavaScript module** and must be retrieved using `require()`.\n\n### Working with Projects and Sequences\n\n```javascript\n// Access project\nconst project = app.project;\n\n// Access active sequence\nconst sequence = project.activeSequence;\n\n// Get selection\nconst selection = await sequence.getSelection();\n\n// Get/set playhead position\nconst position = await sequence.getPlayerPosition();\nawait sequence.setPlayerPosition(newPosition);\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Async Patterns Used for API Calls\n\n### Key Design Decision: Methods Async, Properties Sync\n\nAdobe made a deliberate design choice for the UXP Premiere API:\n\n- **Methods** - Return `Promise` objects and are **asynchronous** (do not block UI thread)\n- **Properties** (getters/setters) - Are **synchronous** and do not need `await`\n\nThis differs from ExtendScript where all calls were synchronous and blocked the Premiere UI.\n\n### Examples of Async Methods (Return Promises)\n\n```javascript\n// These return Promises - use await\nconst timeDisplay = await sequence.getSequenceVideoTimeDisplayFormat();\nconst playerPos = await sequence.getPlayerPosition();\nconst success = await sequence.setPlayerPosition(newTime);\nconst inPoint = await trackItem.getInPoint();\nconst outPoint = await trackItem.getOutPoint();\nconst selection = await sequence.getSelection();\n```\n\n### Async/Await Best Practices\n\n```javascript\n// Recommended pattern\nasync function doWork() {\n    const app = await Application.getApplication();\n    const project = app.project;\n    const sequence = project.activeSequence;\n    \n    // Async method call\n    const position = await sequence.getPlayerPosition();\n    \n    // Sync property access (no await needed)\n    const name = sequence.name;\n}\n```\n\n**Important:** When using array methods like `map()` or `forEach()` with async/await, use traditional `for` loops instead to avoid Promise handling issues.\n\n---\n\n## 5. How to Handle Events from Premiere Pro\n\n### EventManager Class\n\nUXP provides an `EventManager` class for subscribing to Premiere Pro events:\n\n```javascript\nconst premierepro = require('premierepro');\nconst EventManager = premierepro.EventManager;\nconst Constants = premierepro.Constants;\n```\n\n### addEventListener Method\n\n```javascript\nEventManager.addEventListener(\n    target,           // Project, Sequence, VideoTrack, AudioTrack, or EncoderManager\n    eventName,        // String or Constants (SequenceEvent, ProjectEvent, etc.)\n    eventHandler,     // Callback function\n    inCapturePhase    // Optional boolean\n);\n```\n\n### Available Event Types\n\n**Project Events** (`Constants.ProjectEvent`):\n- Project open/close/save events\n\n**Sequence Events** (`Constants.SequenceEvent`):\n- Selection changes\n- Structure changes\n- Playhead changes\n\n**Snap Events** (`Constants.SnapEvent`):\n- `EVENT_SNAP_TO_KEYFRAME` - User scrubs over keyframes with shift key\n- `EVENT_SNAP_TO_TRACKITEM` - User snaps to track item alignments\n- `EVENT_SNAP_PLAYHEAD_TO_TRACKITEM_EDGE` - Playhead snaps to track item edges\n\n**Encoder/Render Events** (`Constants.OperationCompleteEvent`):\n- `EVENT_RENDER_COMPLETE` - AME finished rendering\n- `EVENT_RENDER_ERROR` - AME error\n- `EVENT_RENDER_CANCEL` - AME job canceled\n- `EVENT_RENDER_QUEUE` - AME job queued\n- `EVENT_RENDER_PROGRESS` - Render progress updates\n\n### Legacy app.bind Pattern\n\nThe `app.bind()` method from ExtendScript is also available:\n\n```javascript\napp.bind(\"onActiveSequenceSelectionChanged\", function() {\n    const selection = app.project.activeSequence.getSelection();\n    // Handle selection change\n});\n\napp.bind(\"onActiveSequenceStructureChanged\", function() {\n    // Handle structure change\n});\n```\n\n### Removing Event Listeners\n\n```javascript\nEventManager.removeEventListener(target, eventName, eventHandler);\nEventManager.removeGlobalEventListener(eventName, eventHandler);\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Security and Sandbox Restrictions\n\n### Manifest-Based Permission System\n\nUXP requires plugins to declare permissions in `manifest.json`. Permissions not declared are denied by default. Premiere Pro supports **manifest version 5**.\n\n### Permission Categories\n\n#### Network Access\n\n```json\n{\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": [\"https://api.example.com\", \"https://another.com\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOr for all domains:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": \"all\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Note:** As of Premiere Pro 25.6.3, only HTTPS requests work reliably; HTTP requests may fail even with proper permissions.\n\n#### File System Access\n\n| Level | Description |\n|-------|-------------|\n| (undefined) | No access except plugin://, plugin-temp://, plugin-data:// |\n| `\"request\"` | Allows file pickers for opening/saving files |\n| `\"plugin\"` | Plugin storage only |\n| `\"fullAccess\"` | Full read/write/delete on all volumes (requires user consent) |\n\n```json\n{\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"localFileSystem\": \"fullAccess\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n#### Clipboard Access\n\n```json\n{\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"clipboard\": \"readAndWrite\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nOptions: `\"read\"`, `\"readAndWrite\"`, or undefined (no access).\n\n### Sandbox Scheme Locations\n\nUXP provides shorthand schemes for sandboxed locations:\n\n| Scheme | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `plugin:/` | Plugin installation directory |\n| `plugin-data:/` | Plugin persistent data storage |\n| `plugin-temp:/` | Plugin temporary storage |\n| `file:/` | General file system (requires permission) |\n\n### User Consent\n\nUsers are prompted for consent when plugins attempt to:\n- Use `openExternal()`\n- Use `openPath()`\n- Use `<sp-link>` anchor tags\n\nFor `fullAccess` file system permission, user consent is required at installation time.\n\n### Best Practice\n\nConfigure the minimum required permissions for your use case. Users may refuse to install plugins requesting excessive permissions.\n\n---\n\n## Version Compatibility\n\n| Premiere Pro Version | UXP Version | Notes |\n|---------------------|-------------|-------|\n| v25.6+ | v8.1 | First stable UXP release |\n| v25.0 (Beta) | Earlier | Beta only |\n\n**Important Dates:**\n- December 5, 2024: UXP public beta opened for Premiere Pro\n- Premiere Pro 25.6: UXP graduated from beta\n- September 2026: ExtendScript planned deprecation (still supported until then)\n\n---\n\n## Future Capabilities\n\n**Hybrid Plugins:** UXP has the ability to include C++ components for computationally heavy tasks or direct interaction with host C++ APIs. Note that UXP Hybrid plugins are **not yet implemented** in Premiere Pro but are planned for future releases.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [The Premiere UXP API](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Premiere API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [Understanding UXP APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/)\n- [Premiere Pro DOM APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/dom-apis/)\n- [UXP Manifest for Premiere Pro](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/)\n- [EventManager Class](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/eventmanager/)\n- [Constants Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/constants/)\n- [GitHub - UXP Premiere Pro Samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [GitHub - UXP Premiere Pro Types](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)\n- [Hyper Brew - Premiere Pro UXP Beta](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/)\n- [Adobe Tech Blog - UXP Arrives in Premiere](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n- [UXP for CEP Developers](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/guides/uxp_for_you/uxp_for_cep_devs/)\n- [Davide Barranca - UXP Manifest v5](https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/Adobe-UXP-things-you-need-to-know-manifest-5.html)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1354,"cache_read_input_tokens":23444,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1354,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGe7bRry8ZXvKnJ71Rqw","type":"assistant","uuid":"0eed753c-a067-4454-aabd-4505c6f97746","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:01:50.257Z"}
