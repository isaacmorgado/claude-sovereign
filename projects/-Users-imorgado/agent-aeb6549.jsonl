Integer 'time' values, such as 5 seconds, may be expressed as whole numbers (e.g., '5s').(no content)In .fcpxml files, the start, offset and duration numbers are real-time seconds (as hinted to by the \"s\" at the end). They are not related to framerate. You only need the framerate if you need to convert these times to a frame number or to standard timecode which uses frames.\n\n### Frame Duration Examples\n\n2002/60000 is a rational number describing the duration of a single frame as a fraction of a second (literally the seconds-per-frame). The frame rate (in frames-per-second) is actually the inverse of this: 60000/2002 = 29.97002997 frames per second.(no content)OK, so it's 29.97 fps (which is NTSC 30 fps), so why bother with the rational number? Because it's way more accurate than 30 or even 29.97!(no content)Instead of frames or timecode, FCPX will expect 1 frame of 25fps video - for example - to look like this: 100/2500s.\n\n### Converting Frames to Rational Numbers\n\nIf you use the frame rate as the denominator, the frame number will be the numerator. For example, 1.23*30=36.9 and you'd use 37/30 for frame 37.\n\n### Why Rational Numbers?\n\nFCP 7 rounds frame rates to 3 decimal places; FCP X uses rational time so frame rates will be accurate, not approximate.(no content)Timing information such as in and out points are expressed in time units rather than frame units. So the two formats are completely different and there is no way to directly import FCP 7 XMEML into Final Cut Pro X or vice versa.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"d488d4d2-a861-429a-bce3-517127b7204a","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:51:56.131Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"FCPXML time format ticks frames rational numbers","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Eu8pkpyun1gm6gu2nhXti9","content":[{"title":"FCPXML","url":"https://fcp.cafe/developers/fcpxml/"},{"title":"Demystifying Final Cut Pro XMLs","url":"https://fcp.cafe/developer-case-studies/fcpxml/"},{"title":"Time Unit Calculation - Apple Final Cut Pro Legacy - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/time-unit-calculation/"},{"title":"cp.apple.fcpxml.time","url":"https://commandpost.io/api-references/commandpost/cp.apple.fcpxml.time/"},{"title":"FCPCafe/docs/developer-case-studies/fcpxml.md at main · CommandPost/FCPCafe","url":"https://github.com/CommandPost/FCPCafe/blob/main/docs/developer-case-studies/fcpxml.md"},{"title":"CommandPost/src/extensions/cp/apple/fcpxml/dtd/FCPXMLv1_8.dtd at develop · CommandPost/CommandPost","url":"https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/blob/develop/src/extensions/cp/apple/fcpxml/dtd/FCPXMLv1_8.dtd"},{"title":"A quick note on the Final Cut Pro X XML format - Blog - Digital Rebellion","url":"https://www.digitalrebellion.com/blog/posts/a_quick_note_on_the_final_cut_pro_x_xml_format"},{"title":"GitHub - iamjohnbarker/frames-to-rational","url":"https://github.com/iamjohnbarker/frames-to-rational"},{"title":"Why is it so hard to convert FCP 7 XML to FCP X XML?","url":"http://www.philiphodgetts.com/2011/09/why-is-it-so-hard-to-convert-fcp-7-xml-to-fcp-x-xml/"},{"title":"FCPXML File creation using script - Apple Community","url":"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255681324"}]},"Here's what I found about the FCPXML time format:\n\n## FCPXML Time Format\n\nFinal Cut Pro expresses time values as a rational number of seconds with a 64-bit numerator and a 32-bit denominator.(no content)Frame rates for NTSC-compatible media, for example, use a frame duration of 1001/30000s (29.97 fps) or 1001/60000s (59.94 fps).\n\n### How Time Values Work\n\n'Time' attributes are expressed as a rational number of seconds (e.g., \"1001/30000s\") with a 64-bit numerator and 32-bit denominator.

It's an XML-based format that describes everything in your Final Cut Pro project, including video clips, effects, transitions, and titles (including subtitles).(no content)This XML file format is designed to allow users and third-party applications to import and export the details of a video project to and from Final Cut Pro X.\n\n## Basic Structure\n\nThe FCPXML document follows this general structure:\n\n1. **XML Declaration & DOCTYPE**: Standard XML header with `<!DOCTYPE fcpxml>`\n\n2. **Root Element**: `<fcpxml version=\"X.XX\">` - It's important to know which version of FCPXML you're working with. The version number is also important for compatibility.\n\n3. **Resources Section**: At the top of the .fcpxml file is a resources area which has information about media assets, formats, titles/generators/effects, and even multicam and compound clips used in the export.\n\n4. **Project/Sequence Structure**: You have resources at the top (all files and generators within the project) followed by a single sequence with the storylines and clips inside. There are no tracks and each clip is organized into a parent-child relationship rather than chronological order. Timing information such as in and out points are expressed in time units rather than frame units.\n\n## Current Versions\n\nThe current FCPXML version is 1.11, as seen in recent examples. Different versions of Final Cut Pro support different FCPXML versions. Always check compatibility when sharing projects.\n\n## FCPXMLD Bundle Format (Introduced in FCP 10.6)\n\nThe new format – fcpxmld – is a package, not a single file known as a Bundle. A 'Bundle' in macOS appears as a single file in the Finder, but is a special type of folder that is read as a single file.(no content)In the original fcpxml, additional data, like tracking or stabilization has to be converted from the binary data into a form that can be contained in a text file. This makes the resulting text XML files very large and unwieldy. Developers have to read in all the data, hold it in memory and read it back out. With all the additional data in the XML it becomes very memory intensive, very quickly. By separating out the text-based XML from the various data files, developers can read in the XML without the memory challenges of the combined files.(no content)In each FCPXMLD package (you have to right click and \"show package contents\"), there's an \"info.fcpxml\" file that resolve should be able to read.\n\n## Official Documentation\n\nApple provides official FCPXML Reference documentation to create documents that describe the data your app or workflow extension exchanges with Final Cut Pro.

The change in the clip's duration ripples outward, moving all subsequent clips earlier or later in the timeline.\n\n### Gaps vs Ripple Delete\n\nIf you want to remove clips from the timeline but still maintain the total project duration and timing, you can replace clips with gap clips. This method prevents any ripple edits.(no content)Choose Edit > Replace with Gap (or press Shift-Delete). The selection in the timeline is replaced with a gap clip.\n\n### Removing All Gaps via Timeline Index\n\nPress shift-command-2 for the timeline index. In the clips tab (showing \"all\" at the bottom), search for \"gap\" and all instances of gap appear. Click one of them in the list, and then command-a to select them all. Then, delete.\n\n### XML-Based Timeline Manipulation\n\nAuto Collapse can help get that well manicured sequence by taking an XML of your FCP timeline, examining that XML and creating a newly flattened sequence while leaving the original edit untouched.(no content)It does this in a smart manner by taking into account things like opacity, keys and graphics that have to be on an upper video track. Upon completion you'll get a new sequence (with a unique identifier suffix if you desire) and possibly a happier editor.\n\n### Storyline Considerations\n\nRipple deletes only work when the clips are in a storyline. Added storyline and ripple now works.(no content)Select the connected clips that are in line and press Cmd-G to make a storyline. The delete key will ripple delete.\n\n### Magnetic Timeline Behavior\n\nThe magnetic timeline always ripples. The Position Tool simply inserts or extends gaps to hold space open depending on where a clip is placed. This is not the same as disabling ripple mode.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"7620a61f-fbac-42de-a47f-707d5b8daf86","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:52:56.831Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"FCPXML ripple delete gap collapse timeline XML manipulation","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_013Zc8PC73KUtrNiFTRreU8r","content":[{"title":"FXPX 10.6.5 how do I ripple delete a clip from timeline? | MacRumors Forums","url":"https://forums.macrumors.com/threads/fxpx-10-6-5-how-do-i-ripple-delete-a-clip-from-timeline.2384741/"},{"title":"is there key shortcut to remove all gaps … - Apple Community","url":"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7455025"},{"title":"Clean up a sloppy FCP timeline with Auto Collapse by Scott Simmons - ProVideo Coalition","url":"https://www.provideocoalition.com/clean_up_a_sloppy_fcp_timeline_with_auto_collapse/"},{"title":"Deleting with a Ripple Edit (Leaving No Gap) - Final Cut Pro 6","url":"https://final-cut-pro-6.helpnox.com/en-us/final-cut-pro-user-manual/volume-ii-editing/part-ii-rough-editing/arranging-clips-in-the-timeline/deleting-clips-from-a-sequence/deleting-with-a-ripple-edit-leaving-no-gap/"},{"title":"How do I Ripple Delete in fcpx - Apple Community","url":"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3183669"},{"title":"Remove clips from projects in Final Cut Pro for Mac - Apple Support","url":"https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/remove-clips-from-projects-verc5d34129/mac"},{"title":"Extend or shorten clips in Final Cut Pro for Mac - Apple Support","url":"https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/extend-or-shorten-clips-ver9847ec25/mac"},{"title":"How to turn turn ripple trim on/off in FC… - Apple Community","url":"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7775704"},{"title":"deleting gaps in FCPX - Apple Community","url":"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/3891517"},{"title":"The Position Tool Does Not Disable Ripple Mode – Here’s Why - Creative Community Conversations - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/the-position-tool-does-not-disable-ripple-mode-h/"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about FCPXML ripple delete, gap collapse, and timeline XML manipulation:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Ripple Delete Behavior in Final Cut Pro\n\nDeleting with a ripple edit (also called a ripple delete) removes selected items from the sequence and closes the resulting gap by moving all subsequent items on unlocked tracks to the left.(no content)A ripple delete is useful if you want to remove one or more clip items from your sequence but you don't want to leave a gap.\n\n### How Ripple Delete Works\n\nThe selected clips or portions of clips are removed from the timeline, and any clips to the right of the selection ripple to close the resulting gap.(no content)The default type of trim in Final Cut Pro is a ripple edit, which adjusts a clip's start point or end point without leaving a gap in the timeline.

The spine is the outer timeline in which everything else is contained. Within the spine, you can find asset-clips (segments of a video or audio file) and gap elements.(no content)The gap element has attributes including:\n- `ref` (from resources section)\n- `offset` (a time offset in seconds, relative to the containing spine)\n- `duration` (time in seconds of how long the element is)\n- `start` (similar to offset)\n\n### How Gaps Work in the Timeline\n\nIn FCPXML, a Gap's duration determines the position of subsequent clips. For example, if a Gap duration is 00:00:41:22 (41.88 seconds), the Video Clip that follows starts at that same timecode position. The offset of subsequent clips matches the Gap Duration.(no content)The Primary Storyline in Final Cut Pro will not allow empty gaps at any time. When you delete a clip and leave a gap (using Shift+Delete), it creates a \"gap clip\" in its place. No matter what, there's no way to leave any empty space - it always seals up with a gap clip.\n\n### Removing Gaps\n\nTo replace a clip with a gap, select the clip you want to replace and select Edit > Replace with Gap. This replaces the clip with a gap of the same duration. Gaps always contain audio and video black.(no content)To find and remove gaps, you can use the Timeline Index. Search for \"gap\" and when they are listed, you can select them all and press Delete.

The spine is the outer timeline in which everything else is contained. Within the spine, you can find asset-clips (segments of a video or audio file) and gap elements.(no content)The gap element has attributes including:\n- `ref` (from resources section)\n- `offset` (a time offset in seconds, relative to the containing spine)\n- `duration` (time in seconds of how long the element is)\n- `start` (similar to offset)\n\n### How Gaps Work in the Timeline\n\nIn FCPXML, a Gap's duration determines the position of subsequent clips. For example, if a Gap duration is 00:00:41:22 (41.88 seconds), the Video Clip that follows starts at that same timecode position. The offset of subsequent clips matches the Gap Duration.(no content)The Primary Storyline in Final Cut Pro will not allow empty gaps at any time. When you delete a clip and leave a gap (using Shift+Delete), it creates a \"gap clip\" in its place. No matter what, there's no way to leave any empty space - it always seals up with a gap clip.\n\n### Removing Gaps\n\nTo replace a clip with a gap, select the clip you want to replace and select Edit > Replace with Gap. This replaces the clip with a gap of the same duration. Gaps always contain audio and video black.(no content)To find and remove gaps, you can use the Timeline Index. Search for \"gap\" and when they are listed, you can select them all and press Delete. Note that this will move things around, so check that all the elements in the project still have the correct timing.(no content)A useful workflow for removing gaps: press Shift-Command-2 for the timeline index, in the clips tab (showing \"all\" at the bottom), search for \"gap\" and all instances of gap appear.

Based on the search results, here's what I found:\n\n## FCPXML: Programmatically Splitting a Clip into Two Clips\n\nThe search results show that while Final Cut Pro has a Blade tool for splitting clips interactively, **there is no \"blade\" or \"split\" element in FCPXML**. Instead, splitting a clip in FCPXML is achieved by manipulating the timing attributes of `asset-clip` or `clip` elements.\n\n### How to Split a Clip Programmatically in FCPXML\n\nTo simulate a blade/split operation in FCPXML, you need to create two separate clip elements with adjusted timing attributes:\n\nIn FCPXML structure, an `asset-clip` is a segment of a video or audio file within a `spine` (timeline). Key attributes include:\n- **ref** - references the asset from the resources section\n- **offset** - time offset in seconds, relative to the containing spine\n- **duration** - how long this asset clip is\n- **start** - the source media in-point\n\n### Example Approach\n\nIf you have a single clip and want to split it at a specific point, you would:\n\n1. **Create the first clip** with:\n   - Same `start` as original\n   - `duration` = split point - original start\n   - Same `offset` as original\n\n2. **Create the second clip** with:\n   - `start` = original start + first clip duration (the in-point in source media)\n   - `duration` = original duration - first clip duration\n   - `offset` = original offset + first clip duration\n\n### FCPXML Time Format\n\n\"Frame rates for NTSC-compatible media, for example, use a frame duration of '1001/30000s' (29.97 fps) or '1001/60000s' (59.94 fps). If a time value is equal to a whole number of seconds, the fraction may be reduced into whole seconds (for example, '5s').\"(no content)Time attributes are expressed as a rational number of seconds (e.g., \"1001/30000s\") with a 64-bit numerator and 32-bit denominator.\n\n### Example FCPXML Structure\n\nBased on the search results, here's a conceptual example of what two clips look like after a split:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fcpxml>\n<fcpxml version=\"1.11\">\n  <resources>\n    <format id=\"r1\" frameDuration=\"1/25s\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"/>\n    <asset id=\"r2\" name=\"MyClip.mov\" src=\"file:///path/to/MyClip.mov\" \n           start=\"0s\" duration=\"10s\" hasVideo=\"1\" hasAudio=\"1\"/>\n  </resources>\n  <library>\n    <event name=\"My Event\">\n      <project name=\"My Project\">\n        <sequence format=\"r1\" duration=\"10s\" tcStart=\"0s\">\n          <spine>\n            <!-- First clip (first 5 seconds) -->\n            <asset-clip ref=\"r2\" offset=\"0s\" name=\"MyClip.mov\" \n                        start=\"0s\" duration=\"5s\"/>\n            <!-- Second clip (last 5 seconds) -->\n            <asset-clip ref=\"r2\" offset=\"5s\" name=\"MyClip.mov\" \n                        start=\"5s\" duration=\"5s\"/>\n          </spine>\n        </sequence>\n      </project>\n    </event>\n  </library>\n</fcpxml>\n```\n\n### Tools and Libraries\n\nSteffan Andrews has created a Swift Framework called DAWFileKit, which can read and process FCPXML.(no content)Pipeline was originally developed by Reuel Kim and is no longer maintained. Pipeline Neo was created as a spin-off project to fix and update the library. Pipeline Neo extends the XMLDocument and XMLElement classes in the Foundation framework and adds properties and methods that simplify the creation and management of FCPXML document structure.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nWhen generating FCPXML with scripts, ensure durations and offsets use the proper rational number format (like \"20000/10000s\"). Final Cut Pro doesn't like decimals - you need to match the framerate.(no content)Duration or offset calculation problems can cause issues.

Based on the search results, here's what I found:\n\n## FCPXML: Programmatically Splitting a Clip into Two Clips\n\nThe search results show that while Final Cut Pro has a Blade tool for splitting clips interactively, **there is no \"blade\" or \"split\" element in FCPXML**. Instead, splitting a clip in FCPXML is achieved by manipulating the timing attributes of `asset-clip` or `clip` elements.\n\n### How to Split a Clip Programmatically in FCPXML\n\nTo simulate a blade/split operation in FCPXML, you need to create two separate clip elements with adjusted timing attributes:\n\nIn FCPXML structure, an `asset-clip` is a segment of a video or audio file within a `spine` (timeline). Key attributes include:\n- **ref** - references the asset from the resources section\n- **offset** - time offset in seconds, relative to the containing spine\n- **duration** - how long this asset clip is\n- **start** - the source media in-point\n\n### Example Approach\n\nIf you have a single clip and want to split it at a specific point, you would:\n\n1. **Create the first clip** with:\n   - Same `start` as original\n   - `duration` = split point - original start\n   - Same `offset` as original\n\n2. **Create the second clip** with:\n   - `start` = original start + first clip duration (the in-point in source media)\n   - `duration` = original duration - first clip duration\n   - `offset` = original offset + first clip duration\n\n### FCPXML Time Format\n\n\"Frame rates for NTSC-compatible media, for example, use a frame duration of '1001/30000s' (29.97 fps) or '1001/60000s' (59.94 fps). If a time value is equal to a whole number of seconds, the fraction may be reduced into whole seconds (for example, '5s').\"(no content)Time attributes are expressed as a rational number of seconds (e.g., \"1001/30000s\") with a 64-bit numerator and 32-bit denominator.\n\n### Example FCPXML Structure\n\nBased on the search results, here's a conceptual example of what two clips look like after a split:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE fcpxml>\n<fcpxml version=\"1.11\">\n  <resources>\n    <format id=\"r1\" frameDuration=\"1/25s\" width=\"1920\" height=\"1080\"/>\n    <asset id=\"r2\" name=\"MyClip.mov\" src=\"file:///path/to/MyClip.mov\" \n           start=\"0s\" duration=\"10s\" hasVideo=\"1\" hasAudio=\"1\"/>\n  </resources>\n  <library>\n    <event name=\"My Event\">\n      <project name=\"My Project\">\n        <sequence format=\"r1\" duration=\"10s\" tcStart=\"0s\">\n          <spine>\n            <!-- First clip (first 5 seconds) -->\n            <asset-clip ref=\"r2\" offset=\"0s\" name=\"MyClip.mov\" \n                        start=\"0s\" duration=\"5s\"/>\n            <!-- Second clip (last 5 seconds) -->\n            <asset-clip ref=\"r2\" offset=\"5s\" name=\"MyClip.mov\" \n                        start=\"5s\" duration=\"5s\"/>\n          </spine>\n        </sequence>\n      </project>\n    </event>\n  </library>\n</fcpxml>\n```\n\n### Tools and Libraries\n\nSteffan Andrews has created a Swift Framework called DAWFileKit, which can read and process FCPXML.(no content)Pipeline was originally developed by Reuel Kim and is no longer maintained. Pipeline Neo was created as a spin-off project to fix and update the library. Pipeline Neo extends the XMLDocument and XMLElement classes in the Foundation framework and adds properties and methods that simplify the creation and management of FCPXML document structure.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nWhen generating FCPXML with scripts, ensure durations and offsets use the proper rational number format (like \"20000/10000s\"). Final Cut Pro doesn't like decimals - you need to match the framerate.(no content)Duration or offset calculation problems can cause issues. If you're having trouble, start with simple, whole second durations to make sure duration and/or offset calculations are correct."],"durationSeconds":37.00927904199995}}

In/Out Points Representation\n\n### FCPXML (Modern)\n| Attribute | Description |\n|-----------|-------------|\n| `start` | In-point within source media (where clip begins in the source file) |\n| `duration` | Length of clip on timeline |\n| `offset` | Position on timeline (where clip appears) |\n| `audioStart` / `audioDuration` | For J/L cuts (split edits) |\n\n**Example:**\n```xml\n<asset-clip ref=\"r2\" \n            offset=\"10s\"      <!-- Appears at 10 seconds on timeline -->\n            start=\"5s\"        <!-- Starts 5 seconds into source media -->\n            duration=\"15s\"/>  <!-- Plays for 15 seconds -->\n```\n\n### XMEML (Legacy/Premiere)\n| Element | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| `<in>` | Source in-point (frame 0-based) |\n| `<out>` | Source out-point (frame 1-based) |\n| `<start>` | Timeline start position (frame 0-based) |\n| `<end>` | Timeline end position (frame 1-based) |\n\n**Critical Note:** XMEML uses different ordinal numbering:\n- `in` and `start`: First frame = frame 0\n- `out` and `end`: First frame = frame 1\n\n---\n\n## 3. How to Split a Clip into Two Clips in XML\n\nThere is **no \"blade\" or \"split\" element** in either format. Splitting is accomplished by creating two separate clip elements with calculated timing:\n\n### Original Single Clip:\n```xml\n<asset-clip ref=\"r2\" offset=\"0s\" start=\"0s\" duration=\"10s\"/>\n```\n\n### After Split at 5 seconds:\n```xml\n<!-- First half -->\n<asset-clip ref=\"r2\" \n            offset=\"0s\"       <!-- Same position -->\n            start=\"0s\"        <!-- Same source in-point -->\n            duration=\"5s\"/>   <!-- Half the duration -->\n\n<!-- Second half -->\n<asset-clip ref=\"r2\" \n            offset=\"5s\"       <!-- Starts where first clip ends -->\n            start=\"5s\"        <!-- Source in-point moved forward -->\n            duration=\"5s\"/>   <!-- Remaining duration -->\n```\n\n### Split Formula:\n```\nOriginal: offset=O, start=S, duration=D\nSplit at time T (where 0 < T < D)\n\nClip 1:\n  offset = O\n  start = S\n  duration = T\n\nClip 2:\n  offset = O + T\n  start = S + T\n  duration = D - T\n```\n\n### XMEML Split Example:\n```xml\n<!-- Original: 60 frames at 30fps, starting at frame 0 on timeline -->\n<clipitem id=\"clip1\">\n  <in>0</in>\n  <out>60</out>\n  <start>0</start>\n  <end>60</end>\n</clipitem>\n\n<!-- After split at frame 30: -->\n<clipitem id=\"clip1a\">\n  <in>0</in>\n  <out>30</out>\n  <start>0</start>\n  <end>30</end>\n</clipitem>\n\n<clipitem id=\"clip1b\">\n  <in>30</in>\n  <out>60</out>\n  <start>30</start>\n  <end>60</end>\n</clipitem>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Time Format\n\n### FCPXML: Rational Numbers (Seconds)\nTimes are expressed as **rational numbers of seconds** with 64-bit numerator and 32-bit denominator:\n\n```\nFormat: \"numerator/denominator s\"\n\nExamples:\n  \"5s\"              = 5 seconds (whole number)\n  \"1001/30000s\"     = 1 frame at 29.97fps (NTSC)\n  \"100/2500s\"       = 1 frame at 25fps (PAL)\n  \"1001/60000s\"     = 1 frame at 59.94fps\n  \"2002/60000s\"     = frame duration at 29.97fps interlaced\n```\n\n**Frame Rate to Rational Conversion:**\n```\nFor 29.97fps (NTSC):\n  Frame duration = 1001/30000s\n  Frame N position = (N * 1001)/30000s\n\nFor 25fps (PAL):\n  Frame duration = 100/2500s (or 1/25s)\n  Frame N position = N/25s\n\nFor 24fps:\n  Frame duration = 100/2400s\n  Frame N position = N/24s\n```\n\n### XMEML: Integer Frame Counts\nTimes are expressed as **frame counts** relative to the timebase:\n\n```xml\n<rate>\n  <timebase>30</timebase>   <!-- Frames per second -->\n  <ntsc>TRUE</ntsc>         <!-- If true, actual rate is 29.97 -->\n</rate>\n<in>0</in>                  <!-- Frame 0 -->\n<out>150</out>              <!-- Frame 150 = 5 seconds at 30fps -->\n```\n\n### Conversion Between Formats:\n```python\n# FCPXML rational to frames\ndef rational_to_frames(rational_str, fps):\n    # \"1001/30000s\" -> frames\n    num, denom = rational_str.rstrip('s').split('/')\n    seconds = int(num) / int(denom)\n    return seconds * fps\n\n# Frames to FCPXML rational\ndef frames_to_rational(frames, fps):\n    # For clean numbers, use frame rate as denominator\n    return f\"{frames}/{fps}s\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. How to Remove Clips and Collapse Gaps (Ripple Delete)\n\n### FCPXML Approach:\n\n**To Remove a Clip with Ripple (close gap):**\n1. Delete the `<asset-clip>` element\n2. Recalculate `offset` for all subsequent clips (subtract removed clip's duration)\n\n**Example - Before:**\n```xml\n<spine>\n  <asset-clip ref=\"r1\" offset=\"0s\" duration=\"5s\"/>\n  <asset-clip ref=\"r2\" offset=\"5s\" duration=\"5s\"/>   <!-- DELETE THIS -->\n  <asset-clip ref=\"r3\" offset=\"10s\" duration=\"5s\"/>\n</spine>\n```\n\n**After Ripple Delete of middle clip:**\n```xml\n<spine>\n  <asset-clip ref=\"r1\" offset=\"0s\" duration=\"5s\"/>\n  <asset-clip ref=\"r3\" offset=\"5s\" duration=\"5s\"/>  <!-- Offset reduced by 5s -->\n</spine>\n```\n\n**To Replace with Gap (maintain timing):**\n```xml\n<spine>\n  <asset-clip ref=\"r1\" offset=\"0s\" duration=\"5s\"/>\n  <gap offset=\"5s\" duration=\"5s\"/>                  <!-- Gap placeholder -->\n  <asset-clip ref=\"r3\" offset=\"10s\" duration=\"5s\"/>\n</spine>\n```\n\n### XMEML Approach:\nSimply remove the `<clipitem>` and adjust `<start>`/`<end>` values for subsequent clips:\n\n```xml\n<!-- After ripple delete -->\n<clipitem id=\"clip1\">\n  <start>0</start>\n  <end>150</end>\n</clipitem>\n<clipitem id=\"clip3\">\n  <start>150</start>   <!-- Was 300, now 150 -->\n  <end>300</end>       <!-- Was 450, now 300 -->\n</clipitem>\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6.
