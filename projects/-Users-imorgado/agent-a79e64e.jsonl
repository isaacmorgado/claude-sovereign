You can use that tool to create a plugin folder containing basic scaffolding for HTML, JavaScript, and other required files.(no content)The UXP Developer Tool will create a new folder named after the Plugin ID in the desired location. The folder will contain the essential files needed for your plugin.\n\n### Minimum Required Files\n\nWithin the parent folder, you'll need at minimum two files with exact names. The manifest.json and main.js files stored in your plugin's parent directory are the bare minimum requirement for your plugin to work, but it's possible to have more JavaScript files if you want.\n\n**Key files:**\n- **manifest.json** - This file is where you include facts about your plugin, such as its name, the menu item(s) it adds, and so on.\n- **main.js** (or index.js) - This file contains your JavaScript code that implements the logic for your plugin.\n\n### Template Options\n\nYou can select between two different templates: the ps-starter is the vanilla JavaScript one and then you have a React-based one.(no content)When saving plugin files, the Developer Tool will display a message saying you need to run extra commands from the terminal. This is not true for simple JavaScript-only plugins, only for React-based ones.\n\n### Creating a Plugin\n\nYou can host as many plugins as you want in the UXP Developer Tool. You can either create the plugin folder structure and files from scratch and click the blue Add Plugin button in the Tool, or you can click the Create Plugin button.(no content)When you distribute your plugin, you'll need to obtain a plugin ID from the Adobe Developer Console. For testing, though, just invent an ID like 'com.yourname.pluginname'.\n\n### File System Access\n\nUXP does not allow arbitrary access to the local filesystem; for any file outside of your plugin's home folder, data folder, or temp folder, you must ask the user for access by presenting a built-in UXP dialog.(no content)For sandbox locations, you can use plugin:/, plugin-data:/ and plugin-temp:/.

In addition to core metadata such as the plugin's name, version, icons, and entry points, the manifest specifies permissions.(no content)The manifest also includes compatibility details and other definitions that shape how the plugin integrates with the host environment. Most importantly, it contains your plugin ID, which uniquely identifies your plugin when it's installed in the host application.\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n### Manifest Version\nThe manifest includes a field that indicates the version of the manifest schema. Premiere supports version \"5\".\n\n### Plugin ID\nThe plugin ID uniquely identifies a plugin and is used to disambiguate plugin contexts, storage, errors, etc. For plugins distributed through the plugin marketplace, the id has to match the one set in the Developer Distribution portal.\n\n### Permissions\nTo ensure that plugins are secure, UXP requires that plugins declare the permissions they need to function. Permissions not explicitly declared will be denied by default.(no content)You should configure the most accurate permission for your use case because in the future Adobe will ask users to provide their consent based on it. For example, for file operations, you may find \"fullAccess\" to be the least restrictive, but a user may not be comfortable giving full access to their system unless absolutely necessary.\n\n### Clipboard Permissions\nThe manifest enables the plugin to read and write to the clipboard. Options include: read (enables reading from clipboard), readAndWrite (enables reading from and writing to clipboard). Default value is undefined (no clipboard access).\n\n### Host Definition\nThe host field is an object matching the HostDefinition format. This entry allows your plugin to specify which app your plugin can run on.(no content)During development, the field can contain an array of HostDefinitions, which is convenient during development of cross-compatible UXP plugins. However, during submission to the marketplace, only one HostDefinition is allowed.\n\n### Entry Points\nThe entrypoints field is an array of objects matching the EntryPointDefinition format. These entries appear both in the Plugins menu in the native menubar and the plugin panel. Each entry point specifies a type, to create either a direct-action command or a panel show/hide command.\n\n### Feature Flags\nA set of feature flags can be used to enable or disable certain features of the plugin. These flags are used to gate features that are not yet ready for general availability.\n\n### Hybrid Plugin Support\nThe manifest supports addon definitions for hybrid plugins. A UXP Hybrid plugin is a UXP plugin that can access the power of C++ native libraries.

Most importantly, it contains your plugin ID, which uniquely identifies your plugin when it's installed in the host application.\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n### Manifest Version\nThe manifest includes a field that indicates the version of the manifest schema. Premiere supports version \"5\".\n\n### Plugin ID\nThe plugin ID uniquely identifies a plugin and is used to disambiguate plugin contexts, storage, errors, etc. For plugins distributed through the plugin marketplace, the id has to match the one set in the Developer Distribution portal.\n\n### Permissions\nTo ensure that plugins are secure, UXP requires that plugins declare the permissions they need to function. Permissions not explicitly declared will be denied by default.(no content)You should configure the most accurate permission for your use case because in the future Adobe will ask users to provide their consent based on it. For example, for file operations, you may find \"fullAccess\" to be the least restrictive, but a user may not be comfortable giving full access to their system unless absolutely necessary.\n\n### Clipboard Permissions\nThe manifest enables the plugin to read and write to the clipboard. Options include: read (enables reading from clipboard), readAndWrite (enables reading from and writing to clipboard). Default value is undefined (no clipboard access).\n\n### Host Definition\nThe host field is an object matching the HostDefinition format. This entry allows your plugin to specify which app your plugin can run on.(no content)During development, the field can contain an array of HostDefinitions, which is convenient during development of cross-compatible UXP plugins. However, during submission to the marketplace, only one HostDefinition is allowed.\n\n### Entry Points\nThe entrypoints field is an array of objects matching the EntryPointDefinition format. These entries appear both in the Plugins menu in the native menubar and the plugin panel. Each entry point specifies a type, to create either a direct-action command or a panel show/hide command.\n\n### Feature Flags\nA set of feature flags can be used to enable or disable certain features of the plugin. These flags are used to gate features that are not yet ready for general availability.\n\n### Hybrid Plugin Support\nThe manifest supports addon definitions for hybrid plugins. A UXP Hybrid plugin is a UXP plugin that can access the power of C++ native libraries. However, Premiere doesn't support hybrid plugins yet.\n\n## Development vs. Publishing Requirements\n\nSome fields are \"Develop\" required (required for the plugin to be loaded), while others are \"Publish\" required (required for plugins to be submitted in the Adobe Developer Console and published in the Plugin Manager).(no content)Icons are not required during development, but must be provided when distributing through the Plugin Marketplace.\n\nFor complete documentation, visit the official Adobe developer documentation at: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"],"durationSeconds":30.329420958000004}}

But unless you enable this watch feature (by selecting Watch in the Actions column), nothing will change in Photoshop when you save files.(no content)The best thing about the UXP Developer Tool is that you can choose Watch from the Actions menu, and the tool will automatically reload your plugin whenever you've changed your JavaScript, HTML, or CSS files. You can also select Reload from the Actions menu whenever you want to manually reload your plugin.\n\n## Debugging Options\n\nThere are two main ways to debug UXP plugins:\n\n1. **UXP Developer Tool Debugger**: The simplest way, suitable for many plugins, is to use the UXP Developer Tool. After a plugin has been loaded in the Developer Tool, choose Debug from the Actions menu for the plugin (on the far right of the Developer Tool window).\n\n2. **Chrome DevTools**: The other way, if you've loaded your plugin using the command-line tools, is to use Chrome DevTools, as follows: In a new Chrome window, navigate to chrome://inspect. Press Configure... next to Discover network targets checkbox, and add localhost:xxxx (where \"xxxx\" is the port you declared in your debug.json file). When the extension is loaded, it should show up with its ID on this page.(no content)The debugger (which resembles the Chrome debugger) allows you to look at the console log, and do the usual debugger things such as setting breakpoints, stepping into and out of functions, etc.\n\n## CLI Tools\n\nThe UXP devtools CLI allows you to reload your currently running plugin instance with new changes (no app restart required), launch a rich DevTools environment for debugging your plugin, and view your plugin logs. UXP Devtools are available in form of CLI and Standalone application.\n\n## Working with React/Webpack\n\nWhen you use React, you very likely have Webpack running and Webpack is going to output the final product into a /dist folder with its own manifest. You can tell the UXP DevTool where to find that distribution manifest so it can manage the hot-reloading properly.(no content)If you add the manifest.json in the plugin folder, then you need to update the relative path to the plugin build folder (dist) by clicking the ••• button > \"Options\" > \"Advanced\" > \"Plugin build folder\". During development, it is recommended to build the plugin using yarn watch and load the manifest.json in the (plugin build) dist folder.\n\n## Important Notes\n\nDo not edit code in the debugger - it won't save. Edit code in your IDE text editor, such as VSCode.(no content)Admin privileges are required to use UDT. The UXP Developer Tool requires administrator-level privileges to run correctly.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"377f1e1c-ea74-4ce4-b1e1-16717e0e1bec","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:58:14.602Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP hot reload development watch mode debugging","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01RS1uEJtcU6nosGNFfGghto","content":[{"title":"Debugging UXP Plugins","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/debugging/"},{"title":"Debugging UXP Plugins - Adobe Developer","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/guides/debugging/"},{"title":"UXP Developer Tool (UDT) Walkthrough guide","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/devtool/udt-walkthrough/"},{"title":"Adobe","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/tutorials/debugging/"},{"title":"GitHub - adobe-uxp/devtools-cli: CLI for UXP developer tools, including creating, loading and debugging plugins.","url":"https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #3 UXP Developer Tool | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/Adobe-UXP-things-you-need-to-know-3-UXP-developer-tool.html"},{"title":"GitHub - xWermuth/adobe.uxp.react.typescript.starter: Template for uxp react typescript","url":"https://github.com/xWermuth/adobe.uxp.react.typescript.starter"},{"title":"Essential Development Tools for UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/"},{"title":"devtools-cli/README.md at main · adobe-uxp/devtools-cli","url":"https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli/blob/main/README.md"},{"title":"Are people just not using the broken \"UXP develope... - Adobe Product Community - 15384519","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/indesign-discussions/are-people-just-not-using-the-broken-quot-uxp-developer-tools-quot/td-p/15384519"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about Adobe UXP hot reload development, watch mode, and debugging:\n\n## UXP Developer Tool Watch Mode & Hot Reload\n\nThe UXP Developer Tool has a great \"watch\" feature that automatically reloads your plugins when (almost) any of the files in your plugin folder change.

It's powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers a curated selection of UI components and a more streamlined workflow for developers.\n\n## Build Tools and Bundler Configuration\n\n### When You Need a Bundler\n\nIf you're using the UXP Developer Tool, and using plain JavaScript instead of React, you probably don't need any of the following tools.(no content)If you keep things modular inside main.js, you can build a clean, scalable plugin without Webpack or Vite. That said, for large projects, a build step can help with minification and separating dev/prod configs.\n\n### Important Limitation\n\nUXP doesn't support module imports unless you're compiling everything down into a single script.(no content)Adobe's UXP runtime doesn't support imports, modules, or component files. Everything has to live inside one main.js.\n\n### Using Webpack\n\nWhen working with React, other frameworks, or bundlers like Webpack and Parcel, you'll need to understand how to effectively use them inside the developer tool.\n\nThere's a starter project available: **[webpack-uxp-starter](https://github.com/emptykid/webpack-uxp-starter)** - Build Adobe UXP plugin with Webpack + React + Typescript.\n\n### Using Vite\n\nAs Native ESM is not supported in UXP runtime, which means the default output of Vite is not work in UXP. A plugin-legacy was added to build type=\"text/javascript\" instead of module type.(no content)Sadly, there seems to be bugs in the plugin, which makes vite build --watch not work as expected. An isolated node-watch was added to watch files.\n\nA Vite starter is available: **[vite-uxp-starter](https://github.com/emptykid/vite-uxp-starter)**\n\n### UXP Developer Tool Setup for Bundlers\n\nWhen using bundlers or frameworks, you'll typically have two manifest.json files. One will be in your plugin's source code directory, and the other will be in your plugin's distribution directory. You can load either one of these, but you need to be aware of the differences.(no content)Adding a plugin using the distribution manifest.json means that you're loading the plugin from the distribution folder entirely.

It's powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers a curated selection of UI components and a more streamlined workflow for developers.\n\n## Build Tools and Bundler Configuration\n\n### When You Need a Bundler\n\nIf you're using the UXP Developer Tool, and using plain JavaScript instead of React, you probably don't need any of the following tools.(no content)If you keep things modular inside main.js, you can build a clean, scalable plugin without Webpack or Vite. That said, for large projects, a build step can help with minification and separating dev/prod configs.\n\n### Important Limitation\n\nUXP doesn't support module imports unless you're compiling everything down into a single script.(no content)Adobe's UXP runtime doesn't support imports, modules, or component files. Everything has to live inside one main.js.\n\n### Using Webpack\n\nWhen working with React, other frameworks, or bundlers like Webpack and Parcel, you'll need to understand how to effectively use them inside the developer tool.\n\nThere's a starter project available: **[webpack-uxp-starter](https://github.com/emptykid/webpack-uxp-starter)** - Build Adobe UXP plugin with Webpack + React + Typescript.\n\n### Using Vite\n\nAs Native ESM is not supported in UXP runtime, which means the default output of Vite is not work in UXP. A plugin-legacy was added to build type=\"text/javascript\" instead of module type.(no content)Sadly, there seems to be bugs in the plugin, which makes vite build --watch not work as expected. An isolated node-watch was added to watch files.\n\nA Vite starter is available: **[vite-uxp-starter](https://github.com/emptykid/vite-uxp-starter)**\n\n### UXP Developer Tool Setup for Bundlers\n\nWhen using bundlers or frameworks, you'll typically have two manifest.json files. One will be in your plugin's source code directory, and the other will be in your plugin's distribution directory. You can load either one of these, but you need to be aware of the differences.(no content)Adding a plugin using the distribution manifest.json means that you're loading the plugin from the distribution folder entirely. If your plugin build steps involve removing and recreating the distribution folder, or cleaning all the files within the folder, your plugin may not reload correctly in the developer tool.(no content)When you use React you very likely have Webpack running and Webpack is going to output the final product into a /dist folder with its own manifest, so you can tell the UXP DevTool where to find that distribution manifest so the UXP can manage with the hot-reloading.(no content)If you're adding a plugin that uses a bundler or framework make sure you install its dependencies by running npm install or yarn install. The Developer Tool will not do this for you.\n\n### Recommended Package Managers\n\nnpm is a \"package manager\" bundled with Node which helps manage your project's dependencies (i.e., other code and files that are needed to make your plugin work).(no content)yarn is a \"better\" package manager than npm for Node. Many people, including those developing Photoshop UXP tools, are using yarn instead of npm."],"durationSeconds":29.601210708999993}}

Using the full manifest v5 feature set requires PS 23.3.0 or higher.\n\n### Basic Manifest Structure\n\nEach UXP plugin has one manifest.json file that describes the plugin. It contains metadata such as the plugin's name, version, icons, and entry points. The manifest file also contains the permissions that the plugin requires. Most importantly, it contains your plugin ID which is used to identify your plugin.\n\n### Host Configuration\n\nThe \"host\" is now an array of objects in Manifest v5, which supports multi-host UXP plugins (at the moment Photoshop and Adobe XD).(no content)The \"minVersion\" must be at least \"23.3.0\" for Photoshop.\n\nExample host configuration:\n```json\n\"host\": [\n  {\n    \"app\": \"PS\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"23.3.0\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"apiVersion\": 2\n    }\n  }\n]\n```\n\nThere's a new \"data\" property, where you can specify the \"apiVersion\": set it to 2.\n\n### Required Permissions\n\nTo ensure that plugins are secure, UXP requires that plugins declare the permissions they need to function. Make sure you configure the most accurate permission for your use case because in the future we will ask users to provide their consent based on it.(no content)Users will be asked for their consent when your plugin attempts to use openExternal, openPath, and sp-link/anchor tags. For everything else, consent is given at install time.\n\nExample `requiredPermissions` structure:\n```json\n\"requiredPermissions\": {\n  \"launchProcess\": {\n    \"schemes\": [\"https\", \"mailto\", \"file\"],\n    \"extensions\": [\".pdf\"]\n  },\n  \"network\": {\n    \"domains\": [\"https://example.com\"]\n  },\n  \"allowCodeGenerationFromStrings\": true,\n  \"localFileSystem\": \"plugin\",\n  \"clipboard\": \"read\"\n}\n```\n\n### Network Permissions\n\nThe network permission specifies the domains that the plugin can access in network requests. You can also allow access to all domains by setting domains to \"all\".(no content)requiredPermissions needs domains under network. Sites works under permissions but UXP wants requiredPermissions and not permissions. The network permissions work as long as you have a domain name and not an IP address.\n\n### Complete Example Manifest\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"YOUR_ID_HERE\",\n  \"name\": \"Name of your plugin\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"PS\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"23.3.0\"\n  },\n  \"entrypoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"command\",\n      \"id\": \"commandFn\",\n      \"label\": { \"default\": \"Show A Dialog\" }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"panelName\",\n      \"label\": { \"default\": \"Panel Name\" }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"icons\": [\n    {\n      \"width\": 24,\n      \"height\": 24,\n      \"path\": \"icons/icon.png\",\n      \"scale\": [1, 2]\n    }\n  ],\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": \"all\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe manifestVersion property determines which features the plugin may support and requires specific Photoshop versions in order to run.

Recommended Folder Structure\n\nBased on official Adobe documentation and community best practices, here is the recommended folder structure:\n\n### Minimal Plugin Structure (Vanilla JavaScript)\n```\nmy-premiere-plugin/\n├── manifest.json          # Required: Plugin metadata and configuration\n├── index.html             # Main entry point (HTML-based panel)\n├── index.js               # JavaScript logic\n├── styles.css             # Optional: Custom styles\n└── icons/                 # Plugin icons (required for distribution)\n    ├── icon-24.png\n    ├── icon-48.png\n    └── icon-96.png\n```\n\n### Full Project Structure (With Build Tools)\n```\nmy-premiere-plugin/\n├── src/                        # Source code\n│   ├── index.html              # Main HTML entry\n│   ├── index.js                # Main JavaScript entry\n│   ├── index.ts                # TypeScript source (if using TS)\n│   ├── components/             # UI components\n│   ├── api/                    # Premiere Pro API wrappers\n│   └── styles/                 # CSS/SCSS files\n├── dist/                       # Build output (generated)\n│   ├── manifest.json           # Copied/generated manifest\n│   ├── index.html\n│   └── index.js\n├── public/                     # Static assets\n│   └── icons/\n├── manifest.json               # Source manifest\n├── package.json                # Node dependencies\n├── webpack.config.js           # Or vite.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.json               # If using TypeScript\n└── README.md\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Manifest.json Structure\n\nPremiere Pro supports **manifest version 5**. Here is the complete structure:\n\n### Required Fields\n```json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"com.yourcompany.pluginname\",\n  \"name\": \"My Premiere Plugin\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"premierepro\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"25.6.0\"\n  },\n  \"entrypoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"mainPanel\",\n      \"label\": { \"default\": \"My Panel\" }\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n### Complete Manifest with All Options\n```json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"com.yourcompany.pluginname\",\n  \"name\": \"My Premiere Pro Plugin\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"description\": \"A description of your plugin\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\n  \n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"premierepro\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"25.6.0\"\n  },\n  \n  \"entrypoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"mainPanel\",\n      \"label\": { \"default\": \"Main Panel\" },\n      \"minimumSize\": { \"width\": 230, \"height\": 200 },\n      \"maximumSize\": { \"width\": 2000, \"height\": 2000 },\n      \"preferredDockedSize\": { \"width\": 230, \"height\": 300 },\n      \"preferredFloatingSize\": { \"width\": 400, \"height\": 500 }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"command\",\n      \"id\": \"myCommand\",\n      \"label\": { \"default\": \"Run My Command\" }\n    }\n  ],\n  \n  \"icons\": [\n    { \"width\": 24, \"height\": 24, \"path\": \"icons/icon-24.png\", \"scale\": [1, 2] },\n    { \"width\": 48, \"height\": 48, \"path\": \"icons/icon-48.png\", \"scale\": [1, 2] }\n  ],\n  \n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"localFileSystem\": \"fullAccess\",\n    \"clipboard\": \"readAndWrite\",\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": [\"https://api.example.com\"]\n    },\n    \"launchProcess\": {\n      \"schemes\": [\"https\", \"mailto\"],\n      \"extensions\": [\".pdf\"]\n    },\n    \"allowCodeGenerationFromStrings\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Manifest Fields Explained\n| Field | Required | Description |\n|-------|----------|-------------|\n| `manifestVersion` | Yes | Must be `5` for Premiere Pro |\n| `id` | Yes | Unique plugin identifier (e.g., `com.company.plugin`) |\n| `name` | Yes | Display name of the plugin |\n| `version` | Yes | Semantic version (e.g., `1.0.0`) |\n| `main` | Yes | Entry point file (`index.html` or `index.js`) |\n| `host` | Yes | Target application (`premierepro`) and minimum version |\n| `entrypoints` | Yes | Array of panels and commands |\n| `icons` | Publish | Required for marketplace distribution |\n| `requiredPermissions` | No | Security permissions for file, network, clipboard access |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Entry Point Files and Structure\n\n### HTML Entry Point (index.html)\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n  <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n  <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"styles.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n  <sp-heading>My Plugin</sp-heading>\n  <sp-button id=\"actionBtn\">Run Action</sp-button>\n  <script src=\"index.js\"></script>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### JavaScript Entry Point (index.js)\n```javascript\nconst { entrypoints } = require(\"uxp\");\nconst ppro = require(\"ppro\");  // Premiere Pro API\n\n// Setup entry points\nentrypoints.setup({\n  panels: {\n    mainPanel: {\n      show() {\n        // Called when panel is shown\n      },\n      hide() {\n        // Called when panel is hidden\n      },\n      create() {\n        // Called when panel is created\n      },\n      destroy() {\n        // Called when panel is destroyed\n      }\n    }\n  },\n  commands: {\n    myCommand: {\n      run() {\n        // Command execution logic\n      }\n    }\n  }\n});\n\n// Event listeners\ndocument.getElementById(\"actionBtn\").addEventListener(\"click\", async () => {\n  const project = await ppro.Project.getActiveProject();\n  // Work with the project\n});\n```\n\n### Entry Point Types\n- **Panel**: Creates a dockable UI panel (type: `\"panel\"`)\n- **Command**: Creates a menu command (type: `\"command\"`)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Build Tools and Bundlers\n\n### Important Limitation\nUXP does not support ES modules natively. All code must be bundled into a single file.\n\n### Option 1: No Bundler (Simple Plugins)\n- For vanilla JavaScript plugins without frameworks\n- Keep all code in a single `main.js` or `index.js`\n- No build step required\n\n### Option 2: Webpack\n- Recommended for React + TypeScript projects\n- Community starter: [webpack-uxp-starter](https://github.com/emptykid/webpack-uxp-starter)\n\n**package.json scripts:**\n```json\n{\n  \"scripts\": {\n    \"watch\": \"webpack --watch --mode development\",\n    \"build\": \"webpack --mode production\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Option 3: Vite\n- Community starter: [vite-uxp-starter](https://github.com/emptykid/vite-uxp-starter)\n- Requires `@vitejs/plugin-legacy` because UXP does not support ES modules\n- Known issue: `vite build --watch` may have bugs; use separate file watcher\n\n### Option 4: Bolt UXP (Recommended for Modern Development)\n- Repository: [hyperbrew/bolt-uxp](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp)\n- Supports **React**, **Svelte**, and **Vue**\n- Built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass\n- Features built-in hot reloading via WebSocket (more reliable than file watching)\n- Supports multi-app plugins (Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere Pro)\n\n**Bolt UXP Structure:**\n```\nbolt-uxp-project/\n├── src/                    # UXP plugin code\n│   └── api/                # App-specific APIs\n├── webview-ui/             # Frontend (React/Svelte/Vue)\n├── public/                 # Static assets\n├── dist/                   # Build output\n├── uxp.config.ts           # UXP configuration\n├── vite.config.ts          # Vite configuration\n└── package.json\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Development Environment with Hot Reloading\n\n### UXP Developer Tool (UDT)\n- **Required version**: v2.2.1 or later for Premiere Pro support\n- Download via Creative Cloud Desktop\n- Requires **administrator privileges**\n\n### Setup Steps\n1. Install Premiere Pro v25.6 or later\n2. Install UXP Developer Tool v2.2.1+\n3. Launch UDT and click \"Add Plugin\"\n4. Navigate to your `manifest.json` location\n5. Enable \"Watch\" mode for automatic reloading\n\n### Watch Mode\n- In UDT, select \"Watch\" from the Actions menu for your plugin\n- Changes to `.js`, `.html`, `.css` files trigger automatic reload\n- For bundled projects, point UDT to the `dist/` folder manifest\n\n### Debugging\n1. In UDT, select \"Debug\" from Actions menu\n2. Opens Chrome DevTools-like debugger\n3. Features: Console, breakpoints, step-through, network inspection\n\n### CLI Alternative\n- Repository: [adobe-uxp/devtools-cli](https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli)\n- Provides command-line plugin loading and debugging\n- Chrome DevTools integration via `chrome://inspect`\n\n### For Bundled Projects (Webpack/Vite)\n```bash\n# Terminal 1: Run bundler in watch mode\nnpm run watch\n\n# Terminal 2: UDT loads from dist/ folder\n# Enable Watch in UDT Actions menu\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. UI Frameworks\n\n### Option 1: Vanilla JavaScript + Spectrum UXP\n- No build step required\n- Uses built-in Spectrum UXP components (prefixed with `sp-`)\n- Automatic dark/light theme support\n\n**Example:**\n```html\n<sp-heading>Title</sp-heading>\n<sp-button variant=\"primary\">Click Me</sp-button>\n<sp-textfield placeholder=\"Enter text\"></sp-textfield>\n<sp-slider min=\"0\" max=\"100\"></sp-slider>\n```\n\n### Option 2: Spectrum Web Components (SWC)\n- Modern, open-source Spectrum components\n- UXP v7.0+ supports Web Components\n- SWC components locked to version 0.37.0 in UXP v8.0.0\n- Requires wrapper packages for React integration\n\n### Option 3: React\n- Requires bundler (Webpack or Vite)\n- Use `@swc-react/*` packages for Spectrum components\n- Wrapper needed for Web Component event handling\n\n**React Quirks with Web Components:**\n- Must use `class` instead of `className`\n- Cannot use self-closing tags\n- Boolean attributes need special handling\n- Use wrapper component or `react-uxp-spectrum` package\n\n**React starter templates:**\n- Adobe React template via UDT \"Create Plugin\"\n- [hyperbrew/bolt-uxp](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp)\n- [xWermuth/adobe.uxp.react.typescript.starter](https://github.com/xWermuth/adobe.uxp.react.typescript.starter)\n\n### Option 4: Svelte / Vue\n- Supported via [Bolt UXP](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp)\n- Good compatibility with Web Components\n\n---\n\n## Complete Scaffolding Outline\n\n### Recommended Modern Project Structure (React + TypeScript + Vite)\n\n```\nmy-premiere-uxp-plugin/\n├── src/\n│   ├── index.html                  # Main panel HTML\n│   ├── index.tsx                   # React entry point\n│   ├── App.tsx                     # Main React component\n│   ├── components/\n│   │   ├── Panel.tsx               # Panel UI component\n│   │   └── Controls.tsx            # Control components\n│   ├── hooks/\n│   │   └── usePremiereApi.ts       # Custom hooks for Premiere API\n│   ├── api/\n│   │   ├── premiere.ts             # Premiere Pro API wrapper\n│   │   └── entrypoints.ts          # UXP entrypoint setup\n│   ├── styles/\n│   │   └── main.scss               # Global styles\n│   └── types/\n│       └── uxp.d.ts                # UXP type declarations\n├── public/\n│   └── icons/\n│       ├── icon-24.png\n│       ├── icon-48.png\n│       └── icon-96.png\n├── dist/                           # Build output (git-ignored)\n│   ├── manifest.json\n│   ├── index.html\n│   ├── index.js\n│   └── icons/\n├── manifest.json                   # Source manifest\n├── package.json\n├── vite.config.ts\n├── tsconfig.json\n├── .gitignore\n└── README.md\n```\n\n### Minimal Vanilla JS Structure\n```\nmy-simple-plugin/\n├── manifest.json\n├── index.html\n├── index.js\n├── styles.css\n└── icons/\n    └── icon.png\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Requirements Summary\n\n| Requirement | Value |\n|-------------|-------|\n| Premiere Pro Version | 25.6 or later |\n| UXP Developer Tool | v2.2.1 or later |\n| Manifest Version | 5 |\n| Host App ID | `premierepro` |\n| Entry Point Types | `panel`, `command` |\n| API Style | Asynchronous (unlike ExtendScript) |\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [The Premiere UXP API - Official Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [UXP Manifest for Premiere Pro](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/)\n- [Building Your First UXP Plugin](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/)\n- [Adding Command Entrypoints](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/tutorials/adding-command-entrypoints/)\n- [Essential Development Tools for UXP](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro Samples - GitHub](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [Bolt UXP Boilerplate - GitHub](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp)\n- [webpack-uxp-starter - GitHub](https://github.com/emptykid/webpack-uxp-starter)\n- [vite-uxp-starter - GitHub](https://github.com/emptykid/vite-uxp-starter)\n- [react-uxp-spectrum - GitHub](https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/react-uxp-spectrum)\n- [UXP Developer Tools CLI - GitHub](https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli)\n- [UXP Manifest v5 Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v5/)\n- [Spectrum Web Components in UXP](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/swc/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1722,"cache_read_input_tokens":23794,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1722,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGe7YyXkBXMwmZA7urXL","type":"assistant","uuid":"8460b090-1f31-47b3-876c-dfec5008c4d0","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:02:09.341Z"}
