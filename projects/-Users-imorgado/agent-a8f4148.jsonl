This means they blocked the Premiere UI while they were executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread.

The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.(no content)This is different from what's possible with CEP + CSDK (or even UXP + CSDK) in that the C++ code is distributed with and runs alongside the JavaScript code. Communication between the two happens via an API layer modeled against NodeJS N-API.\n\n## Key Features\n\nUXP Hybrid Plugins allow you to write C++ functions and call them from UXP. This is useful for performance critical operations and accessing system methods not yet part of the UXP APIs.(no content)Your plugin can extend its functionality by making use of helper libraries, which are developed native modules that can inject various APIs into the plugin's JS context.\n\n## Photoshop C++ Plugin APIs\n\nPhotoshop offers a number of C based plugin APIs documented in the downloadable package. A hybrid plugin can get access to these APIs by exposing an additional function entry point.(no content)Plugins using native C++ are an important part of the Photoshop extensibility ecosystem and will continue to be supported.

The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.(no content)This is different from what's possible with CEP + CSDK (or even UXP + CSDK) in that the C++ code is distributed with and runs alongside the JavaScript code. Communication between the two happens via an API layer modeled against NodeJS N-API.\n\n## Key Features\n\nUXP Hybrid Plugins allow you to write C++ functions and call them from UXP. This is useful for performance critical operations and accessing system methods not yet part of the UXP APIs.(no content)Your plugin can extend its functionality by making use of helper libraries, which are developed native modules that can inject various APIs into the plugin's JS context.\n\n## Photoshop C++ Plugin APIs\n\nPhotoshop offers a number of C based plugin APIs documented in the downloadable package. A hybrid plugin can get access to these APIs by exposing an additional function entry point.(no content)Plugins using native C++ are an important part of the Photoshop extensibility ecosystem and will continue to be supported. A communication bridge suite was created to allow C++ plugins running under Photoshop to communicate with UXP plugins.\n\n## Development & Debugging\n\nUXP Hybrid plugin has both JavaScript and C++. Use the UDT Debug tool for setting breakpoints for JavaScript. For debugging C++ code, you must attach to the Photoshop.exe process via the IDE. In most IDEs you can find that option under Debug -> Attach to Process.\n\n## Requirements\n\nUpgrade to manifest v5 to unlock new features in UXP including webview, hybrid C++ plugins, and enhanced security.(no content)Currently, hybrid plugins are only supported in Photoshop."],"durationSeconds":23.756424583000133}}

This allows you to take advantage of more performant C++ code to enhance your plugins.(no content)The concept of a hybrid plugin is very similar to Node.js C++ Addons. The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.\n\n## Manifest Configuration\n\nThe manifest is a JSON file that is located at the root of the plugin bundle. It is named manifest.json and is required for all plugins. Each UXP plugin has one manifest.json file that describes the plugin.\n\n### Key Requirements for Hybrid Plugins\n\nYou need to upgrade to manifest v5 to unlock new features in UXP including webview, hybrid C++ plugins, and enhanced security.(no content)First, update the \"manifestVersion\". Changing the value of the manifestVersion element is the key to upgrading your plugin. This determines whether you're using the MV4 or MV5 feature set.

This allows you to take advantage of more performant C++ code to enhance your plugins.(no content)The concept of a hybrid plugin is very similar to Node.js C++ Addons. The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.\n\n## Manifest Configuration\n\nThe manifest is a JSON file that is located at the root of the plugin bundle. It is named manifest.json and is required for all plugins. Each UXP plugin has one manifest.json file that describes the plugin.\n\n### Key Requirements for Hybrid Plugins\n\nYou need to upgrade to manifest v5 to unlock new features in UXP including webview, hybrid C++ plugins, and enhanced security.(no content)First, update the \"manifestVersion\". Changing the value of the manifestVersion element is the key to upgrading your plugin. This determines whether you're using the MV4 or MV5 feature set.

To publish and distribute your plugin, Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop v5.10 is required.\n- Currently, hybrid plugins are only supported in Photoshop.\n\n### Cross-Platform Compilation Requirements\n- UXP Hybrid Plugin needs cross-compile the C++ for MacOS Arm, MacOS Intel and Windows.\n- Photoshop plugins have traditionally required native C++ code that must be compiled separately for macOS (Intel and Arm) and Windows. This \"UXP Hybrid Plugin\" approach, while powerful, can become cumbersome because each build must accommodate multiple platforms, Photoshop C++ APIs, and specific code for image buffers and manipulations.\n\n### Skill Requirements\n- In order to write a Hybrid plugin, you must be proficient in C++.\n\n### Communication Limitations\n- Communication between the two plugins is only possible in strings.\n\n### Code Signing Requirements\n- Sign and notarize the executables for macOS with a valid developer certificate from an Apple developer account. Self-signed/test certificates are not allowed. Make sure the certificate is valid for at least one year.\n- Since hybrid plugins have native capabilities, the users will be required to enter their OS admin credentials during plugin installation and update.\n\n### Hot Reloading Limitations\n- While Bolt UXP supports hot reloading, this does not extend to the C++ Hybrid plugin portion of the project. If you only make changes to the frontend code, hot reloading will work as expected, however if you make changes to the MacOS or Windows binaries, you will see a warning in the console that you need to unload and load the plugin since the binaries are locked during debug.\n\n### UXP General Limitations (also applicable to hybrid plugins)\n- UXP is not a browser, it is a subset of web standards built from the ground-up by Adobe. This means many features in CSS/HTML/JS that work in the browser will not work in UXP. This includes many CSS rules, HTML elements, and JavaScript methods.\n- Features like Web Workers and POSIX threads are currently off-limits within UXP plugins.\n\n### WebAssembly Limitations\n- WebAssembly isn't officially supported in Photoshop's UXP framework.\n- Because of Photoshop's strict Content Security Policies (CSP), Emscripten-compiled code sometimes fails at runtime, displaying errors like \"Code generation from strings disallowed for this context.\"\n\n### SDK Update Considerations\n- Keep in mind that updating to a new SDK version will require recompiling and republishing your plugin, and may also include changes to the minimum host app version supported.\n\n### Filter Menu Limitations\n- If you wish to build a Photoshop filter that appears under the Filter menu or implement a new file type, you probably should create a C++ plugin using PS CSDK. But opt for UXP Hybrid plugins if you want to write generic C++ code alongside JavaScript.\n- Bear in mind that the filter in this example would only be known to the UXP hybrid plugin. (i.e., filters created via hybrid plugins won't appear in Photoshop's native Filter menu)\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"861afcbe-864b-4f8d-bed1-651246c27a13","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:31:57.577Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP hybrid plugin limitations restrictions what cannot be done","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01YEU8udoDzwLrR8qkJ4eKZM","content":[{"title":"UXP Hybrid plugin - Getting started","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/getting-started/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP Hybrid plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/"},{"title":"UXP Hybrid plugin - FAQs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/faqs/"},{"title":"UXP Hybrid plugin - Distribute","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/distribute/"},{"title":"Photoshop Product specific manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/photoshop-manifest/"},{"title":"GitHub - hyperbrew/bolt-uxp: A lightning-fast boilerplate for building Adobe UXP Plugins in Svelte, React, or Vue built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass","url":"https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp"},{"title":"API Changelog","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/ps_reference/changelog/"},{"title":"WebAssembly in Adobe Photoshop UXP plugins | by Michele Renzullo | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@renzullomichele/webassembly-in-adobe-photoshop-uxp-plugins-46aca4def9d6"},{"title":"Plugin manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"Documentation-UXP for Adobe Photoshop","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about Adobe UXP hybrid plugin limitations and restrictions:\n\n## Adobe UXP Hybrid Plugin Limitations and Restrictions\n\n### Platform and Version Requirements\n- In order to build and test your plugins, you will need at least Photoshop v24.2.0 and UDT v1.7.0.

This allows you to take advantage of more performant C++ code to enhance your plugins.(no content)The concept of a hybrid plugin is very similar to Node.js C++ Addons. The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn order to build and test your plugins, you will need at least Photoshop v24.2.0 and UDT v1.7.0. To publish and distribute your plugin, Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop v5.10 is required.\n\n## Manifest Configuration\n\nFor hybrid plugins, you need to use **manifest v5**. Upgrade to manifest v5 to unlock new features in UXP including webview, hybrid C++ plugins, and enhanced security.(no content)Manifest v5 gives developers access to a new plugin permissions model and WebViews in modal dialogs. Using the full manifest v5 feature set requires PS 23.3.0 or higher.\n\n### Basic Manifest Structure Example\n\nHere's a typical manifest.json structure for a UXP plugin:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"your-plugin-id\",\n  \"name\": \"My UXP Plugin\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"PS\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"23.3.0\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"apiVersion\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"entryPoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"command\",\n      \"id\": \"myCommand\",\n      \"label\": { \"default\": \"My Command\" }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"myPanel\",\n      \"label\": { \"default\": \"My Panel\" }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"localFileSystem\": \"fullAccess\",\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": [\"https://example.com\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Native Addon (.uxpaddon) Configuration\n\nAdobe has \"opened the pathway to allow a .uxpaddon to utilize the Photoshop C++ SDK. In this way, you create a compiled filter and bundle it with a UXP dialog to control it.\"(no content)A post-build action will copy the resulting .uxpaddon binary to the ./public-hybrid folder. If you are using a different version of Visual Studio, you may need to update settings for this to work, but Adobe recommends 2019 currently.\n\n### Accessing Native Code from JavaScript\n\nA hybrid plugin can get access to Photoshop C-based plugin APIs by exposing an additional function entry point. After Photoshop loads a hybrid addOn, it will invoke this method. The basicSuite argument can be used to obtain Photoshop API suites.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBegin by downloading the UXP Hybrid plugin SDK from Developer Console. Unpack the contents and make sure you check out the README.md. There are special instructions for building and packaging hybrid plugins since they are different from a standard UXP plugin.(no content)Try the ready-to-use template-plugin provided within the SDK to say a quick 'Hello world!'. Load the template via UDT, and find it under the Plugins menu.\n\nFor detailed manifest configuration documentation, you can refer to:\n- Adobe's official [Manifest v5 documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v5/)\n- [UXP Hybrid plugins guide](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/)\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"bf7a1367-e9b4-4ccc-a976-f1cd60f2452b","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:32:06.903Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"UXP hybrid plugin\" manifest.json \"addon\" OR \"native\" configuration example","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01KdomtjTQC628DVV4So7Usi","content":[{"title":"Plugin manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"Manifest File Structure - UXP Manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP Hybrid plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/"},{"title":"Photoshop Plugins With UXP: Panels & Commands | Francesco's GameDev Corner","url":"https://minifloppy.it/posts/2024/photoshop-plugins-with-uxp-panels-commands/"},{"title":"uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/ui-react-starter/plugin/manifest.json at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/blob/main/ui-react-starter/plugin/manifest.json"},{"title":"uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/ui-playground/plugin/manifest.json at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/blob/main/ui-playground/plugin/manifest.json"},{"title":"UXP Manifest v5","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v5/"},{"title":"The manifest.json file (v4)","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/manifest/"},{"title":"uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/ui-kitchen-sink/manifest.json at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/blob/main/ui-kitchen-sink/manifest.json"},{"title":"UXP Hybrid plugin - Getting started","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/getting-started/"}]},"Let me search for more specific information about the manifest.json configuration for UXP hybrid plugins with addon configuration:",{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01MvkZtwkpeFNE2waqbfuyxm","content":[{"title":"Plugin manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"UXP Manifest v5","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v5/"},{"title":"Manifest File Structure - UXP Manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/"},{"title":"Photoshop Plugins With UXP: Panels & Commands | Francesco's GameDev Corner","url":"https://minifloppy.it/posts/2024/photoshop-plugins-with-uxp-panels-commands/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP Hybrid plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/"},{"title":"Big Updates Coming to UXP.

This allows you to take advantage of more performant C++ code to enhance your plugins.(no content)The concept of a hybrid plugin is very similar to Node.js C++ Addons. The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn order to build and test your plugins, you will need at least Photoshop v24.2.0 and UDT v1.7.0. To publish and distribute your plugin, Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop v5.10 is required.\n\n## Manifest Configuration\n\nFor hybrid plugins, you need to use **manifest v5**. Upgrade to manifest v5 to unlock new features in UXP including webview, hybrid C++ plugins, and enhanced security.(no content)Manifest v5 gives developers access to a new plugin permissions model and WebViews in modal dialogs. Using the full manifest v5 feature set requires PS 23.3.0 or higher.\n\n### Basic Manifest Structure Example\n\nHere's a typical manifest.json structure for a UXP plugin:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"your-plugin-id\",\n  \"name\": \"My UXP Plugin\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"PS\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"23.3.0\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"apiVersion\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"entryPoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"command\",\n      \"id\": \"myCommand\",\n      \"label\": { \"default\": \"My Command\" }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"myPanel\",\n      \"label\": { \"default\": \"My Panel\" }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"localFileSystem\": \"fullAccess\",\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": [\"https://example.com\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Native Addon (.uxpaddon) Configuration\n\nAdobe has \"opened the pathway to allow a .uxpaddon to utilize the Photoshop C++ SDK.

The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.(no content)The hybrid plugin you build using the new UXP SDK will let you bundle C++ code and JavaScript in the same plugin package and provide you with more efficient options to communicate between the two worlds.\n\n## Communication API\n\nThis is different from what's possible with CEP + CSDK (or even UXP + CSDK) in that the C++ code is distributed with and runs alongside the JavaScript code. Communication between the two happens via an API layer modeled against NodeJS N-API.\n\n## C++ Code Example\n\nThe search results show an example of extracting parameters from JavaScript calls in C++:\n\nFor example, trying to modify the \"MyEcho\" to accept two parameters, the sample C++ code for extracting the first parameter uses: `addon_value arg1; size_t argc = 1; Check(UxpAddonApis.uxp_addon_get_cb_info(env, info, &argc, &arg1, nullptr, nullptr));`\n\n## PSDLLMain Entry Point\n\nA hybrid plugin can get access to these APIs by exposing an additional function entry point.(no content)After Photoshop loads a hybrid addOn, it will invoke this method. The basicSuite argument can be used to obtain Photoshop API suites. See the C++ SDK for information about how to acquire Photoshop suites. The code uses `extern \"C\" UXP_EXTERN_API_STDCALL(SPErr) PSDLLMain(const char* selector, SPBasicSuite* spBasic, void*)` and `gBasicSuite->AcquireSuite()` to access Photoshop suites.\n\n## Building and Packaging\n\nOnce you have compiled the above C++ code, you are required to rename the extension of the executable to `.uxpaddon`. Please make sure to read all the instructions in the SDK README. Now you can call the function from JavaScript.(no content)The project is set up for Visual Studio 2019. A post-build action will copy the resulting .uxpaddon binary to the ./public-hybrid folder. If you are using a different version of Visual Studio, you may need to update settings for this to work, but Adobe recommends 2019 currently.\n\n## Debugging\n\nUXP Hybrid plugin has both - JavaScript and C++. Use the UDT Debug tool for setting breakpoints for JavaScript. For debugging C++ code, you must attach to the Photoshop.exe process via the IDE. In most IDEs you can find that option under Debug -> Attach to Process.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBegin by downloading the UXP Hybrid plugin SDK from Developer Console.

The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.(no content)The hybrid plugin you build using the new UXP SDK will let you bundle C++ code and JavaScript in the same plugin package and provide you with more efficient options to communicate between the two worlds.\n\n## Communication API\n\nThis is different from what's possible with CEP + CSDK (or even UXP + CSDK) in that the C++ code is distributed with and runs alongside the JavaScript code. Communication between the two happens via an API layer modeled against NodeJS N-API.\n\n## C++ Code Example\n\nThe search results show an example of extracting parameters from JavaScript calls in C++:\n\nFor example, trying to modify the \"MyEcho\" to accept two parameters, the sample C++ code for extracting the first parameter uses: `addon_value arg1; size_t argc = 1; Check(UxpAddonApis.uxp_addon_get_cb_info(env, info, &argc, &arg1, nullptr, nullptr));`\n\n## PSDLLMain Entry Point\n\nA hybrid plugin can get access to these APIs by exposing an additional function entry point.(no content)After Photoshop loads a hybrid addOn, it will invoke this method. The basicSuite argument can be used to obtain Photoshop API suites. See the C++ SDK for information about how to acquire Photoshop suites. The code uses `extern \"C\" UXP_EXTERN_API_STDCALL(SPErr) PSDLLMain(const char* selector, SPBasicSuite* spBasic, void*)` and `gBasicSuite->AcquireSuite()` to access Photoshop suites.\n\n## Building and Packaging\n\nOnce you have compiled the above C++ code, you are required to rename the extension of the executable to `.uxpaddon`. Please make sure to read all the instructions in the SDK README. Now you can call the function from JavaScript.(no content)The project is set up for Visual Studio 2019. A post-build action will copy the resulting .uxpaddon binary to the ./public-hybrid folder. If you are using a different version of Visual Studio, you may need to update settings for this to work, but Adobe recommends 2019 currently.\n\n## Debugging\n\nUXP Hybrid plugin has both - JavaScript and C++. Use the UDT Debug tool for setting breakpoints for JavaScript. For debugging C++ code, you must attach to the Photoshop.exe process via the IDE. In most IDEs you can find that option under Debug -> Attach to Process.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBegin by downloading the UXP Hybrid plugin SDK from Developer Console. Unpack the contents and make sure you check out the README.md. There are special instructions for building and packaging hybrid plugins since they are different from a standard UXP plugin.(no content)More info on Hybrid Plugins can be found at the Adobe developer site. Currently, hybrid plugins are only supported in Photoshop."],"durationSeconds":32.890629916999956}}

Hybrid plugins currently only work in **Photoshop** (requires v24.2.0+).\n\n---\n\n## 1. How C++ Plugins and UXP Plugins Communicate\n\nThere are **two distinct communication architectures** in Adobe's ecosystem:\n\n### A. UXP Hybrid Plugins (Photoshop Only - Not Yet in Premiere)\n- Communication happens via an **N-API layer modeled after Node.js C++ Addons**\n- C++ code is compiled into a `.uxpaddon` binary that runs alongside JavaScript\n- The C++ code is distributed with and runs alongside the JavaScript code in a single plugin package\n- Functions are directly callable from JavaScript after requiring the native module\n\n### B. Separate C++ Plugin + UXP Plugin (Legacy Approach)\n- Uses **PIUXPSuite** messaging system (Photoshop-specific)\n- Communication happens via **PIActionDescriptor** messages\n- Requires two separate plugins installed via custom installer\n- **Limitation: Communication is only possible in strings**\n\n---\n\n## 2. API for Calling C++ Functions from UXP JavaScript\n\nFor hybrid plugins (Photoshop), the communication uses an API modeled on **Node.js N-API**:\n\n**C++ side key functions:**\n- `uxp_addon_get_cb_info()` - Extract parameters from JavaScript calls\n- `PSDLLMain()` - Entry point that Photoshop calls after loading the .uxpaddon\n- `gBasicSuite->AcquireSuite()` - Access Photoshop API suites\n\n**For separate plugins (PIUXPSuite):**\n- `SendUXPMessage(selfRef, uxpPluginId, descriptor)` - Send messages C++ to UXP\n- `AddUXPMessageListener(selfRef, notifier)` - Register listener for UXP messages\n- `RemoveUXPMessageListener(selfRef)` - Remove listener\n\n---\n\n## 3. Adobe's Recommended \"Hybrid Plugin\" Architecture\n\nAdobe's hybrid plugin approach combines:\n- **JavaScript/HTML/CSS** for UI and orchestration\n- **C++ native libraries** (.uxpaddon files) for performance-critical operations\n\nKey characteristics:\n- Single plugin package distribution (no separate installers)\n- Uses **manifest v5** (required for hybrid plugin features)\n- Similar to Node.js C++ Addons architecture\n- C++ code compiled to `.uxpaddon` extension\n- Requires cross-compilation for macOS (Intel + Arm) and Windows\n\n---\n\n## 4. Official Examples of C++ + UXP Hybrid Plugins\n\n**Official resources:**\n- **UXP Hybrid Plugin SDK** - Download from Adobe Developer Console\n- Contains `template-dev` - Basic example illustrating C++/JS communication\n- Contains `template-plugin` - Ready-to-use \"Hello World\" hybrid plugin\n- **GitHub**: [AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Data Passing Between C++ and JavaScript Layers\n\n**Hybrid Plugins (N-API approach):**\n- Data types are marshaled through the N-API layer\n- Similar to Node.js native addons data passing\n- Supports passing multiple parameters (though developers have reported challenges)\n\n**Separate Plugins (PIUXPSuite):**\n- Uses `PIActionDescriptor` for structured data\n- **Critical limitation: Only string data can be passed between separate plugins**\n\n---\n\n## 6. Limitations of This Bridging Approach\n\n| Limitation | Details |\n|------------|---------|\n| **Platform availability** | Hybrid plugins only in Photoshop, NOT Premiere Pro |\n| **Cross-compilation required** | Must build for macOS Intel, macOS Arm, and Windows |\n| **Code signing required** | macOS requires valid Apple developer certificate (not self-signed) |\n| **No hot reloading for C++** | Changes to C++ require full plugin reload |\n| **Admin credentials** | Users must enter OS admin credentials during install |\n| **String-only communication** | For separate C++/UXP plugins (not hybrid) |\n| **No Filter menu integration** | Hybrid plugin filters do not appear in native Filter menu |\n| **C++ proficiency required** | Adobe considers this an \"advanced topic\" |\n| **No WebAssembly support** | Not officially supported in UXP |\n| **No Web Workers/POSIX threads** | Off-limits in UXP plugins |\n\n---\n\n## 7. Messaging System, Shared Memory, or Direct Function Calls\n\n**Hybrid Plugins:**\n- **Direct function calls** via N-API (similar to Node.js addons)\n- Functions exposed in C++ are directly callable from JavaScript\n- No explicit messaging layer - native code injected into JS context\n\n**Separate Plugins (PIUXPSuite):**\n- **Messaging system** using ActionDescriptor\n- Only one notifier per plugin may be registered\n- Communication identified by Component ID (PiPL) and UXP Plugin ID (manifest.json)\n\n---\n\n## 8. Manifest.json for Hybrid Plugin\n\nHybrid plugins require **manifest v5**. Key structure:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"com.example.hybrid-plugin\",\n  \"name\": \"My Hybrid Plugin\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"PS\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"24.2.0\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"apiVersion\": 2\n    }\n  },\n  \"entrypoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"mainPanel\",\n      \"label\": { \"default\": \"My Panel\" }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"localFileSystem\": \"fullAccess\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe `.uxpaddon` binary is placed in a designated folder (typically `./public-hybrid`) and loaded by the plugin.\n\n---\n\n## Premiere Pro Specific Status\n\n| Feature | Status |\n|---------|--------|\n| UXP Plugins | **Available** (v25.6+) |\n| C++ SDK | **Available** (separate from UXP) |\n| UXP Hybrid Plugins | **NOT available** (planned for future) |\n| C++ to UXP Bridge | **NOT available** in Premiere |\n\nFor Premiere Pro, C++ SDK and UXP are currently **completely separate extensibility platforms** with no official bridging mechanism.\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Adobe UXP Hybrid Plugin Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/)\n- [UXP Hybrid Plugin - Getting Started](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/getting-started/)\n- [UXP Hybrid Plugin - FAQs](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/faqs/)\n- [Communication with C++ Plugin SDK (PIUXPSuite)](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/ps_reference/media/cpp-pluginsdk/)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [UXP Arrives in Premiere Blog Post](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n- [UXP Manifest v5](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v5/)\n- [Big Updates Coming to UXP - Adobe Tech Blog](https://medium.com/adobetech/big-updates-coming-to-uxp-3185f0e47130)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP Beta - Hyper Brew](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/)\n- [Adobe Developer Forums - UXP to C++ Communication](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-to-c-plugin-communication/793)\n- [GitHub - UXP Photoshop Plugin Samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1358,"cache_read_input_tokens":27205,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1358,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGgbLpoFueHHUMVX5g1k","type":"assistant","uuid":"d75011d5-29b0-4163-a043-77917484f3f9","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:34:05.496Z"}
