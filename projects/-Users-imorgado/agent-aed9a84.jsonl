When a user inputs a single keyboard shortcut, Keyboard Maestro will respond with a series of predefined actions. For editing purposes, you enter one Premiere Pro keyboard shortcut, and Keyboard Maestro responds with a string of additional shortcuts.\n\n2. **Stringouts and Match Frame**: You can use Keyboard Maestro to create one key that can perform multiple keystrokes. With one keystroke, you can see straight away which take a clip is from and how many others there are in that setup.\n\n3. **Labeling Footage**: Keyboard Maestro macros can perform tedious and repetitious keystrokes for you. Each time you run it, it will open the selected clip in Source Monitor and prompt you for scene and take information. The information from the previous clip is automatically rolled over and the Take variable is incremented by one.\n\n4. **Effects and Presets Shortcuts**: Keyboard Maestro can automate many things, including the ability to chain together multiple macro steps, such as getting current mouse position, moving the mouse, clicking and dragging effects onto the timeline, etc.\n\n### Key Capabilities for Premiere Pro\n\nKeyboard Maestro offers input simulation including keystrokes, mouse clicks, and drag-and-drop actions; window management to move, resize, and focus windows; and app control to launch, quit, or bring apps to the front and send commands via their scripting interfaces.\n\n### Tips for Premiere Pro Macros\n\nIf your computer lags at any point in the process, add more pauses to the macro. Whenever something seems wrong, adding pauses usually solves the problem.(no content)Don't mix up your Enter and Return keystrokes, because they have different effects when editing text fields. Enter is on your numpad; Return is above the Shift key. If you have a keyboard without a numpad, you can use Keyboard Maestro's dropdown to specify which key to use.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"567d9818-0a9a-40dd-bb8a-6090ccbce078","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:53:21.449Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Keyboard Maestro Premiere Pro automation keystrokes","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01LDTwLYfZjUbhD6iy1eqZcj","content":[{"title":"Keyboard Maestro 11.0.4: Work Faster with Macros for macOS","url":"https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/"},{"title":"Better solutions for these macros in Premiere Pro? - Questions & Suggestions - Keyboard Maestro Discourse","url":"https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/better-solutions-for-these-macros-in-premiere-pro/15539"},{"title":"MediaStorm Guide to Super Fast Logging with Premiere Pro and Keyboard Maestro – Latest News from MediaStorm","url":"https://www.mediastorm.com/blog/2013/09/27/mediastorm-guide-to-super-fast-logging-with-premiere-pro-and-keyboard-maestro/"},{"title":"Sound Editing Automation with Keyboard Maestro","url":"https://blog.prosoundeffects.com/sound-editing-automation-with-keyboard-maestro-video"},{"title":"GitHub - CLdestiny/key-maestro: Key Maestro hosts the Keyboard Maestro Mac download and setup guide, a premier macOS automation tool for streamlined workflows 🐙.

The information from the previous clip is automatically rolled over and the Take variable is incremented by one.\n\n4. **Effects and Presets Shortcuts**: Keyboard Maestro can automate many things, including the ability to chain together multiple macro steps, such as getting current mouse position, moving the mouse, clicking and dragging effects onto the timeline, etc.\n\n### Key Capabilities for Premiere Pro\n\nKeyboard Maestro offers input simulation including keystrokes, mouse clicks, and drag-and-drop actions; window management to move, resize, and focus windows; and app control to launch, quit, or bring apps to the front and send commands via their scripting interfaces.\n\n### Tips for Premiere Pro Macros\n\nIf your computer lags at any point in the process, add more pauses to the macro. Whenever something seems wrong, adding pauses usually solves the problem.(no content)Don't mix up your Enter and Return keystrokes, because they have different effects when editing text fields. Enter is on your numpad; Return is above the Shift key. If you have a keyboard without a numpad, you can use Keyboard Maestro's dropdown to specify which key to use."],"durationSeconds":22.772257292000113}}

To launch the daemon, open PluginInstaller and navigate to the Preferences window.(no content)Launching the daemon will start an HTTPS server on https://localhost.tgrg.net. This DNS name resolves to 127.0.0.1.(no content)Some of these functions are implemented in JavaScript in `crdtux.js` and are synchronous. Other functions are delegated to a daemon process, and are always asynchronous.\n\n## Current CRDT_UXP Support\n\nCRDT_UXP is designed for UXP and UXPScript development, currently supporting Adobe InDesign and Adobe Photoshop.\n\n**Note:** Based on the search results, CRDT_UXP currently supports InDesign and Photoshop, but there is no explicit mention of Premiere Pro support in CRDT_UXP.\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP Native Capabilities\n\nFor Premiere Pro specifically, Adobe provides its own UXP platform:\n\nUXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)UXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment.(no content)The UXP Core APIs include file system, networking, shell execution, and core UXP functionality.\n\nIf you need external communication capabilities in Premiere Pro UXP plugins that go beyond the built-in UXP networking APIs, CRDT_UXP's daemon-based approach (which works via HTTPS to localhost) could potentially be adapted, though official support for Premiere Pro isn't currently listed in the CRDT documentation.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3be9c94f-355b-4c63-ab02-89ad612ab91f","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:53:46.874Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CRDT_UXP daemon Adobe Premiere Pro external communication","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01GFm3sGuxxEqwsRf7ZKngPH","content":[{"title":"Creative Developer Tools - Rorohiko Workflow Resources","url":"https://rorohiko.com/wordpress/creative-developer-tools/"},{"title":"GitHub - zwettemaan/CRDT_UXP: Integrating Tightener into UXP","url":"https://github.com/zwettemaan/CRDT_UXP"},{"title":"Creative Developer Tools (CRDT) Documentation – Creative Developer Tools","url":"https://creativedevelopertools.com/creative-developer-tools/"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"Introduction to Creative Developer Tools (CRDT) – Creative Developer Tools","url":"https://creativedevelopertools.com/creative-developer-tools/introduction-to-creative-developer-tools-crdt/"},{"title":"Getting Started with CRDT for UXP/UXPScript – Creative Developer Tools","url":"https://creativedevelopertools.com/creative-developer-tools/getting-started-with-crdt-for-uxp-uxpscript/"},{"title":"CRDT_UXP/CreativeDeveloperTools_UXP/crdtuxp.js at 747befdd625d5f93f2daad88de9dda1db723d26d · zwettemaan/CRDT_UXP","url":"https://github.com/zwettemaan/CRDT_UXP/blob/747befdd625d5f93f2daad88de9dda1db723d26d/CreativeDeveloperTools_UXP/crdtuxp.js"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro"},{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about CRDT_UXP daemon and Adobe Premiere Pro external communication:\n\n## CRDT_UXP Overview\n\nCreative Developer Tools (CRDT) is a comprehensive suite of tools designed to streamline and enhance the development process for script developers and plug-in developers within the Adobe Creative Cloud ecosystem.(no content)There are two different versions of CRDT: one for UXP/UXPScript and another for CEP/ExtendScript.\n\n## CRDT_UXP and Daemon Requirement\n\nCRDT_UXP requires a daemon process to be running in the background.

Other functions are delegated to a daemon process, and are always asynchronous.\n\n## Current CRDT_UXP Support\n\nCRDT_UXP is designed for UXP and UXPScript development, currently supporting Adobe InDesign and Adobe Photoshop.\n\n**Note:** Based on the search results, CRDT_UXP currently supports InDesign and Photoshop, but there is no explicit mention of Premiere Pro support in CRDT_UXP.\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP Native Capabilities\n\nFor Premiere Pro specifically, Adobe provides its own UXP platform:\n\nUXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)UXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment.(no content)The UXP Core APIs include file system, networking, shell execution, and core UXP functionality.\n\nIf you need external communication capabilities in Premiere Pro UXP plugins that go beyond the built-in UXP networking APIs, CRDT_UXP's daemon-based approach (which works via HTTPS to localhost) could potentially be adapted, though official support for Premiere Pro isn't currently listed in the CRDT documentation."],"durationSeconds":21.20396654199995}}

Can UXP Plugins Trigger Keyboard Shortcuts Directly?\n\n**No, not directly.** UXP in Premiere Pro does not have a native API to simulate keyboard shortcuts like Cmd+K (cut at playhead). Furthermore:\n\n- **There is no \"Cut\" or \"Add Edit\" API** in ExtendScript, CEP, or UXP. As confirmed in Adobe forums: \"There is no 'Cut' or 'Add Edit' function available\" and \"There is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool.\"\n- The workaround in pure API terms involves manually adjusting clip durations and inserting new trackItems, which is complex and error-prone.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [UXP Razor tool discussion](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-razor-tool-and-marking-clipped-sections/td-p/15547922)\n- [Perform a cut from script?](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/perform-a-cut-from-script/td-p/11389974)\n\n---\n\n### 2. External Automation Tools for Sending Keystrokes\n\n#### AppleScript / osascript\n\n**Works, but requires Accessibility permissions.**\n\n```applescript\ntell application \"Adobe Premiere Pro 2024\" to activate\ntell application \"System Events\"\n    delay 0.5\n    keystroke \"k\" using command down  -- Cmd+K for cut at playhead\nend tell\n```\n\n**Requirements:**\n- Enable Accessibility permissions in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility for Script Editor, Automator, Terminal, or your custom app\n- On macOS Sonoma, you may need to toggle permissions OFF then ON again to fix \"AppleScript not allowed to send keystrokes\" errors\n\n**Sources:**\n- [How to automate keyboard in Mac OS X with AppleScript](https://eastmanreference.com/how-to-automate-your-keyboard-in-mac-os-x-with-applescript)\n- [AppleScript keystroke issues](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255165673)\n\n#### Keyboard Maestro\n\n**Excellent choice for Premiere Pro automation.** It can:\n- Chain multiple keystrokes with pauses\n- Create app-specific macros\n- Simulate mouse clicks, drags, and keyboard input\n- Work reliably with proper delay configuration\n\n**Tips:**\n- Add pauses if Premiere lags\n- Distinguish between Return (key code 36) and Enter (numpad)\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Keyboard Maestro](https://www.keyboardmaestro.com/main/)\n- [Keyboard Maestro + Premiere Pro solutions](https://forum.keyboardmaestro.com/t/better-solutions-for-these-macros-in-premiere-pro/15539)\n- [Labeling footage with Keyboard Maestro](https://christophertennant.horse/2023/04/18/quickly-label-footage-in-avid-and-premiere-using-macros-tutorial/)\n\n#### BetterTouchTool\n\n**Can create app-specific keyboard triggers** for Premiere Pro. Features:\n- Keyboard shortcuts, trackpad gestures, Touch Bar triggers\n- App-specific actions\n- Ability to chain multiple actions\n\n**Source:**\n- [BetterTouchTool Keyboard Shortcuts](https://docs.folivora.ai/docs/201_keyboard_shortcuts.html)\n\n#### Automator\n\nCan use the \"Run AppleScript\" action to send keystrokes, subject to the same Accessibility permissions as direct AppleScript.\n\n---\n\n### 3. UXP Communication with External Automation Tools\n\n**Architecture: UXP Plugin (WebSocket Client) -> External Server (Node.js) -> osascript**\n\nUXP plugins can connect to external servers via WebSocket as a **client** (they cannot be servers). The recommended architecture:\n\n1. **UXP Plugin** connects to localhost WebSocket server\n2. **Node.js Server** receives commands and executes osascript\n3. **osascript** sends keystrokes to Premiere Pro\n\n**Example Node.js server using node-osascript:**\n\n```javascript\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\nconst osascript = require('node-osascript');\n\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });\n\nwss.on('connection', (ws) => {\n    ws.on('message', (message) => {\n        if (message === 'cut-at-playhead') {\n            osascript.execute(`\n                tell application \"Adobe Premiere Pro 2024\" to activate\n                delay 0.3\n                tell application \"System Events\"\n                    keystroke \"k\" using command down\n                end tell\n            `);\n        }\n    });\n});\n```\n\n**UXP Plugin WebSocket client:**\n\n```javascript\n// manifest.json must include:\n// \"requiredPermissions\": { \"network\": { \"domains\": [\"ws://localhost:8080\"] } }\n\nconst ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8080');\nws.onopen = () => console.log('Connected');\n\nfunction cutAtPlayhead() {\n    ws.send('cut-at-playhead');\n}\n```\n\n**npm packages for osascript:**\n- [node-osascript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-osascript)\n- [applescript](https://www.npmjs.com/package/applescript)\n- [osascript-tag](https://www.npmjs.com/package/osascript-tag)\n\n**Sources:**\n- [UXP WebSocket Example](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/tree/main/io-websocket-example)\n- [WebSocket API in UXP](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-js/Global%20Members/Data%20Transfers/WebSocket/)\n\n---\n\n### 4. CRDT_UXP Daemon\n\n**Not suitable for keyboard simulation.** CRDT_UXP:\n- Currently supports InDesign and Photoshop (not Premiere Pro explicitly)\n- Provides file system, encryption, and other utilities via daemon\n- Does **not** expose shell execution, osascript, or keyboard simulation functions\n- The daemon runs an HTTPS server on localhost.tgrg.net (resolves to 127.0.0.1)\n\nIf Premiere Pro support is added to CRDT_UXP, it could potentially provide another communication channel, but keyboard simulation would still require an external tool.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [CRDT_UXP GitHub](https://github.com/zwettemaan/CRDT_UXP)\n- [CRDT Documentation](https://creativedevelopertools.com/creative-developer-tools/)\n\n---\n\n### 5. Practical Implementation Recommendation\n\n**Best approach for triggering Cmd+K from UXP:**\n\n```\nUXP Plugin Button Click\n    |\n    v\nWebSocket message to Node.js server (localhost:8080)\n    |\n    v\nNode.js executes osascript\n    |\n    v\nAppleScript sends keystroke to Premiere Pro\n```\n\n**Complete example setup:**\n\n1. **Node.js keystroke server** (run in background):\n\n```javascript\n// keystroke-server.js\nconst WebSocket = require('ws');\nconst { exec } = require('child_process');\n\nconst wss = new WebSocket.Server({ port: 8080 });\n\nconst shortcuts = {\n    'cut': 'keystroke \"k\" using command down',\n    'razor': 'keystroke \"c\"',  // Select razor tool\n    'save': 'keystroke \"s\" using command down'\n};\n\nwss.on('connection', (ws) => {\n    ws.on('message', (msg) => {\n        const cmd = shortcuts[msg.toString()];\n        if (cmd) {\n            exec(`osascript -e 'tell application \"System Events\" to ${cmd}'`);\n        }\n    });\n});\n\nconsole.log('Keystroke server running on ws://localhost:8080');\n```\n\n2. **UXP Plugin** connects and sends commands\n\n3. **Ensure Accessibility permissions** for Terminal or Node\n\n---\n\n### 6. Known Issues\n\n- **HTTP vs HTTPS bug in Premiere Pro 25.6.3**: There's a reported issue where HTTP requests fail while HTTPS works. Use `wss://` if possible, or test with current Premiere version.\n- **Delays are critical**: Always add 0.3-0.5 second delays after activating the app before sending keystrokes\n- **Focus requirements**: Premiere Pro must be the frontmost app for keystrokes to work\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Premiere Pro 25.6.3 UXP HTTP Issue](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-bugs/premiere-pro-25-6-3-uxp-issue-unable-to-make-requests-with-http-urls-vs-https/idi-p/15622477)\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Method | Can Trigger Keystrokes | UXP Integration | Setup Complexity |\n|--------|----------------------|-----------------|------------------|\n| UXP Native API | No | N/A | N/A |\n| AppleScript/osascript | Yes | Via WebSocket server | Medium |\n| Keyboard Maestro | Yes | Via URL trigger or WebSocket | Low-Medium |\n| BetterTouchTool | Yes | Via URL trigger | Low |\n| CRDT_UXP | No | Not for this purpose | N/A |"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2482,"cache_read_input_tokens":28744,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2482,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWJqsHswjGAJEhn6Ne32K","type":"assistant","uuid":"955b8a4e-b91e-4c19-b302-b2d9c2cfdc4a","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:57:02.026Z"}
