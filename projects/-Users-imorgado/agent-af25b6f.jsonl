For example, credits can be used for 10 minutes of high-quality Text to Speech with Multilingual v2, 15 minutes of Agents, or 20 minutes of low-latency Text to Speech with Flash v2.5.\n\n### Plan Tiers\n\nThe Starter plan costs $5 per month and includes 30k credits/month. The Creator plan (most popular) costs $22 per month ($11 for the first month with 50% off) and includes 100k credits/month.(no content)The Business plan starts at $1,320 per month and includes about 13,750–22,000 text-to-speech minutes and 6,000 speech-to-text hours.\n\n### API Access\n\nThe API is included in all plans, even the free plan, and there is no extra cost associated with the API except for the cost of the actual generation.(no content)API usage depends on your plan, but typically costs around $0.20 per 1,000 characters for standard voices. Rates may be higher for licensed or custom voices, and usage is deducted from your plan's credit balance.\n\n### Key Features by Plan\n\n- Instant voice cloning is typically introduced at the Starter plan, while Professional voice cloning becomes available at the Creator tier. The Free plan is for non-commercial use only, while paid plans grant commercial usage rights.\n\n### 2025 Pricing Evolution\n\nIn January 2025, ElevenLabs restructured its pricing with a more segmented, model-aware system. For the first time, usage wasn't treated uniformly; character credits were split across two separate models: Multilingual v2 and Conversational v1. Users received distinct credit buckets for each model, with unique overage rates and usage tracking.(no content)By August 2025, ElevenLabs simplified its pricing. Instead of multiple usage pools, they unified character credits again—regardless of model (Multilingual or Flash). Plans became more transparent: each tier clearly defined how many characters you could use, what models you had access to, and how many voice slots, cloning credits, and dubbing entitlements were included.\n\nFor specific Voice Isolator API pricing details, you may want to check the official ElevenLabs API pricing page directly at elevenlabs.io/pricing/api, as the Voice Isolator uses the same credit system as other API services.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4dcf2beb-28bc-4625-9fbb-49c028d03e76","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:57:44.305Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"ElevenLabs voice isolation API pricing 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_016FNx5nMgSMfLWniaXuUqFz","content":[{"title":"ElevenLabs API Pricing — Build AI Audio Into Your Product","url":"https://elevenlabs.io/pricing/api"},{"title":"The Complete Guide to ElevenLabs Plans Overages and Usage Based Pricing","url":"https://flexprice.io/blog/elevenlabs-pricing-breakdown"},{"title":"ElevenLabs Pricing & Alternatives - 2025 Guide","url":"https://www.callpod.ai/blog/elevenlabs-pricing"},{"title":"ElevenLabs Pricing Plans | A Complete Breakdown · WebsiteVoice Blog | Add Free Text-to-Speech to Your Site","url":"https://websitevoice.com/blog/elevenlabs-pricing-plans/"},{"title":"Eleven Labs Software Pricing 2025","url":"https://www.g2.com/products/elevenlabsio/pricing"},{"title":"ElevenLabs Pricing (December 2025): Compare Plans & Find the Best One | SaaSworthy","url":"https://www.saasworthy.com/product/elevenlabs-io/pricing"},{"title":"How much does it cost to use the API? – ElevenLabs","url":"https://help.elevenlabs.io/hc/en-us/articles/28184926326033-How-much-does-it-cost-to-use-the-API"},{"title":"Complete Elevenlabs Pricing Guide With Features and Best Use Cases - Voice.ai","url":"https://voice.ai/hub/tts/elevenlabs-pricing/"},{"title":"ElevenLabs Software Pricing & Plans 2025: See Your Cost","url":"https://www.vendr.com/marketplace/elevenlabs"},{"title":"ElevenLabs pricing: A complete breakdown for 2025 - eesel AI","url":"https://www.eesel.ai/blog/elevenlabs-pricing"}]},"Here's the information I found about ElevenLabs Voice Isolation API pricing in 2025:\n\n## ElevenLabs Voice Isolation API Pricing (2025)\n\nThe Voice Isolator API is one of ElevenLabs' products, alongside Text to Speech API, Speech to Text API, Voice Changer API, Sound Effects API, and Music API.\n\n### General Pricing Structure\n\nElevenLabs operates on a credit-based system where credits are usable for different services.

Users are charged based on the number of tokens processed, with separate rates for input and output tokens.\n\n### Historical Pricing (March 2024)\nFrom earlier 2024 data:\n- **Llama 2 70B** (4096 Context Length): ~300 tokens/s, $0.70/$0.80 per million tokens (input/output)\n- **Llama 2 7B** (2048 Context Length): ~750 tokens/s, $0.10/$0.10 per million tokens\n- **Mixtral 8x7B SMoE** (32K Context Length): ~480 tokens/s, $0.27/$0.27 per million tokens\n- **Gemma 7B** (8K Context Length): ~820 tokens/s, $0.10/$0.10 per million tokens\n\n### Llama 3.1 Models on Groq (2025)\nLlama 3.1 405B is the largest and most capable model, offering the highest performance across various tasks. Its pricing reflects its advanced capabilities, making it suitable for complex applications that require top-tier performance.(no content)Llama 3.1 70B is positioned as a balance between performance and cost, offering strong capabilities at a more accessible price point. It's well-suited for a wide range of applications that require advanced language understanding and generation.\n\n### Key Pricing Features\nGroq calculates costs based on a rate per one million tokens processed. The company provides distinct pricing for input tokens and output tokens, a common practice that reflects the different computational resources required for each process.(no content)This pay-as-you-go system is managed through GroqCloud, the company's on-demand platform, which also offers a free tier for developers to experiment with the API under certain rate limits.\n\n### Cost Comparison\nThe Groq Llama 3.1 token price in 2025 is significantly lower than leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet. For instance, the Llama 3.1 70B model on Groq is over four times cheaper on input and more than twelve times cheaper on output compared to GPT-4o. This cost differential can be a deciding factor for startups and businesses with high-volume workloads.\n\n### Speed Advantage\nGroq's LPU technology enables exceptionally fast inference, which can be crucial for real-time applications. With output speeds reaching up to 249 tokens per second for the Llama 3.1 70B model, Groq outperforms many competitors in this aspect.\n\nFor the most current and exact pricing figures, I recommend visiting [Groq's official pricing page](https://groq.com/pricing) as these prices are subject to change, and Groq may offer volume discounts for high-usage customers.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"84e10928-2305-4792-b67c-a9368774a59a","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:58:33.625Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Groq API pricing Llama Mixtral per token 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Lx6tuFm4m1x4tjdPMiTwFa","content":[{"title":"Groq On-Demand Pricing for Tokens-as-a-Service | Groq is fast, low cost inference.","url":"https://groq.com/pricing"},{"title":"For comparison, Groq [1] has (price per million tokens of input vs output): Llam... | Hacker News","url":"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=39698073"},{"title":"Groq Llama 3.1 Pricing Guide 2025","url":"https://www.byteplus.com/en/topic/448470"},{"title":"Groq is fast, low cost inference.","url":"https://groq.com/"},{"title":"A complete guide to Groq pricing in 2025 - eesel AI","url":"https://www.eesel.ai/blog/groq-pricing"},{"title":"Groq Llama 3.1 API Pricing: A Comprehensive Guide","url":"http://anakin.ai/blog/groq-llama-3-1-api-pricing/"},{"title":"Pricing: Compare Groq API Pricing With Other API Providers","url":"https://groq-ai.com/pricing/"},{"title":"Groq mixtral-8x7b-32768 Pricing Calculator | API Cost Estimation","url":"https://www.helicone.ai/llm-cost/provider/groq/model/mixtral-8x7b-32768"},{"title":"LLMs API price calculator","url":"https://rows.com/calculators/llm-api-price-calculator"},{"title":"Groq Llama 3 Pricing: 2025 Cost & Performance Guide","url":"https://www.byteplus.com/en/topic/448468?title=groq-llama-3-pricing-comprehensive-2025-cost-and-performance-analysis"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about Groq API pricing for Llama and Mixtral models:\n\n## Groq API Pricing Overview\n\nGroq employs a token-based pricing model for its Llama 3.1 offerings.
