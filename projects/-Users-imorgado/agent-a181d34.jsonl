You can also update your Language and Speaker labeling options as per your requirements.(no content)To generate transcripts, select Window > Text. Select the icon in the Transcript tab to open the Generate static transcript dialog box to set your transcription options. Options include selecting the language in the video (downloading language packs if necessary), choosing to separate speakers in the video, and transcribing audio clips tagged as Dialogue.\n\n### Two Transcription Methods\n\nA new transcription method was introduced in PR 23.4.0, May 2023. The original transcription method transcribed Sequences only and did not change as you edited. The new method transcribes Source media, and that transcript stays with the media, which can be used for \"Text-Based editing.\"\n\n### Text-Based Editing Workflow\n\nAdobe's Text-Based Editing feature in Premiere Pro has completely transformed the editing process. With Text-Based Editing, you can use the transcribed text as the primary representation of audio or video content. You can see the transcript right inside of Premiere Pro and edit, rearrange, add, or remove sentences in the transcript—with text edits automatically synchronized with the corresponding audio or video.\n\n### 2025 Updates\n\nVersion 25.2.0 now includes translating captions. This feature had been in Beta for a while before being added to the release version.\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- The feature is included with your Premiere Pro subscription — no extra cost.\n- With clean audio, accuracy can reach 95–98%. Heavy background noise may reduce precision.\n- It requires an internet connection to access Adobe's AI transcription service.\n- You can export as .SRT, .XML, or burn-in captions for platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, and Netflix.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"deaeadfb-25da-41dd-969d-bc43e116cfec","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:30:50.689Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe Premiere Pro text-based editing auto-transcription 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01REBwmbH49bRHiWJVSJooZa","content":[{"title":"Transcribe videos using Text-Based Editing in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere/desktop/edit-projects/edit-video-using-text-based-editing/transcribe-video.html"},{"title":"Adobe Speech to Text for Premiere Pro (2025 Guide)","url":"https://www.miracamp.com/learn/premiere-pro/adobe-speech-to-text"},{"title":"Auto transcribe video using Speech-to-Text in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/speech-to-text.html"},{"title":"Adobe Speech-to-Text in Premiere Pro","url":"https://motionarray.com/learn/premiere-pro/speech-to-text-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Transcribe video to text with AI - Adobe","url":"https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere/speech-to-text.html"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere transcribe - Adobe Product Community - 14050083","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-transcribe/td-p/14050083"},{"title":"Premiere Pro 2025 - No option to transcribe sequence in text tab","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-2025-no-option-to-transcribe-sequence-in-text-tab/td-p/14936987"},{"title":"How to Transcribe Audio in Premiere Pro","url":"https://www.notta.ai/en/blog/premiere-pro-transcription"},{"title":"How to use text-based editing in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/video/text-based-editing-video.html"},{"title":"How Premiere Pro's Text-Based Editing Transforms Filmmaking","url":"https://blog.frame.io/2023/10/16/premiere-pro-text-based-editing/"}]},"Here's what I found about Adobe Premiere Pro's text-based editing and auto-transcription features for 2025:\n\n## Adobe Premiere Pro Text-Based Editing & Auto-Transcription (2025)\n\n### Overview\n\nWith Adobe Speech to Text for Premiere Pro, editors can now auto-transcribe and create captions directly inside the software — saving hours of manual work and streamlining the editing process.

Delete a sentence from the transcript? The corresponding audio and video segment vanishes instantly from your project.(no content)Descript's AI video editor lets you edit your video simply by editing text. It automatically transcribes your footage, so when you change or delete words in the transcript, your video updates instantly.\n\n## Key Features in 2025\n\n### AI Co-Editor: Underlord\nAnnounced in August 2025, Underlord is Descript's most ambitious AI feature yet. It acts as a conversational co-editor. You can give it natural language prompts like, \"Find the 5 best clips and turn them into vertical videos with captions,\" and it will chain together multiple AI actions to execute the request.\n\n### AI-Powered Tools\nIn 2025, the AI video editing tools have expanded dramatically: Studio Sound turned my echoey home office into a professional studio; Eye Contact AI fixes constant glancing at scripts; Remove Filler Words eliminated 73 \"ums\" in one click.(no content)Descript's AI co-editor, Underlord, can edit your video automatically based on your direction. It can tighten cuts, remove silences or filler words, improve audio, and even add visuals or captions—all while keeping your creative intent intact.\n\n### Transcription Accuracy\nBenefit from 95% transcription accuracy and specialized audio tools that automatically remove filler words and enhance dialogue-heavy content to professional standards.\n\n### Hybrid Editing Approach\nDescript hasn't abandoned traditional timeline editing. In fact, they've made it surprisingly intuitive with Timeline 2.0 (now in Labs). This hybrid approach—text-based editing with timeline precision when you need it—is what sets Descript apart. You're not forced into one paradigm.\n\n### Collaboration Features\nAdded in late August 2025, Cursor Presence shows live cursors of teammates working in the same project. It's like Google Docs for video editing—you see colorful cursors moving through the transcript as colleagues make edits. Setup takes 10 seconds.\n\n### Generative Video\nIt also powers a new generative video feature, allowing you to create unique animated clips from a text description, reducing reliance on stock footage.\n\n## Best Suited For\nBest for: podcasters, interviewers, educators, marketers creating tutorials, and YouTubers whose content mainly features spoken content.(no content)Avoid if: You are a professional video editor or filmmaker who requires advanced visual editing tools.\n\n## Pricing\nThe Free plan offers 1 hour of transcription per month, the Creator plan ($12/month billed annually) provides 10 hours, and the Pro plan ($24/month) offers 30 hours of transcription.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4a901593-55c8-40e5-9ec1-e81e3550a7f4","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:30:54.541Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Descript transcript-based video editing approach features 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01J7Zm2bYZ6qtvvdZYPjUZ3z","content":[{"title":"Descript Review 2025: Text-Based Video Editing & More","url":"https://www.vidmetoo.com/descript-review/"},{"title":"Descript – Free AI Video Editing Software | Fast & Easy","url":"https://www.descript.com/video-editing"},{"title":"Descript – AI Video & Podcast Editor | Free, Online","url":"https://www.descript.com/"},{"title":"Descript AI Review (2025): Is Text-Based Editing the Future?","url":"https://skywork.ai/skypage/en/Descript-AI-Review-(2025)-Is-Text-Based-Editing-the-Future/1973805544004841472"},{"title":"Descript Review 2025: Revolutionary or Overhyped?","url":"https://max-productive.ai/blog/descript-review-2025/"},{"title":"Edit Video Online Free | Descript's AI Video Editor","url":"https://www.descript.com/tools/video-editor"},{"title":"Descript Review | AI Video Editing","url":"https://www.miracamp.com/learn/video-editing/descript-review"},{"title":"Descript Review 2025: AI Video Editor Features, Pros, Cons & Filmora Alternative","url":"https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editor-review/descript-ai.html"},{"title":"Complete AI Video Editing Tutorial for Beginners!

It streamlines the editing process by facilitating rapid jump cuts.\n\n**Key capabilities include:**\n- TimeBolt is lightning fast and an extremely powerful editor for jump-cut videos with silence removal. No matter how long the video is, TimeBolt can remove silence using automation that renders the whole process quick and effortless. You can also remove silence by fast-forwarding or speeding through silent segments, and all silence detection parameters can be customized to detect any or all dead-air parts.\n- TimeBolt's Umcheck feature automatically removes filler words with hybrid AI transcription technology, with research showing a 94% satisfaction rate with filler word removal accuracy.\n- Exports to Premiere, Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Camtasia.\n- Resolution support up to 4K.\n- Features include parallel processing, video stabilization, webcam, and screen capture.\n\n## Top Alternatives to TimeBolt\n\n### 1. **Recut**\nRecut is the most similar to TimeBolt in terms of workflow and features, and it works on both Mac and Windows.(no content)It's also much faster – in testing on a 20-minute recording, Recut was 6x faster, taking only 1.2 seconds to read the audio and find silence, while TimeBolt took 7.4 seconds. Recut also works with files of any length without splitting into chunks and responds immediately when you change settings.(no content)However, Recut can't add transitions yet (though it automatically adds volume ramps at cut edges) and can't fast-forward silences yet, only remove them.\n\n### 2. **Descript**\nIndependent reviews confirm that TimeBolt offers the most accurate automated cleanup among tested tools, while Descript provides a strong alternative, especially for users who prefer to fine-tune their edits manually.(no content)Descript has raised around $100 million from investors including OpenAI Startup Fund, Andreessen Horowitz, Redpoint, and Spark Capital.\n\n### 3. **Kapwing**\nKapwing's tool automatically detects and removes silent gaps from MP3 and WAV files. Users have control over silence sensitivity settings for precise customization. It's accessible via any web browser and saves valuable editing time by automating detection and removal.(no content)The free version offers unlimited exports but with a watermark, limiting quality to 720p and video duration to 4 minutes.\n\n### 4. **Cleanvoice AI**\nCleanvoice AI is an automated podcast editing platform that uses artificial intelligence to remove background noise, filler words, long silences, and mouth sounds from audio and video podcasts in minutes instead of hours.\n\n### 5. **DaVinci Resolve**\nIts automatic silence removal feature is effective, but users report a significant learning curve and a more complex interface, making it better suited for experienced editors. DaVinci Resolve's unique interface and workflow require patience to master, but can produce some of the highest video quality.\n\n### 6. **Other Notable Alternatives**\n- Recut is an automatic video and audio editing application for Mac and Windows that quickly removes silent segments and saves hours of editing time.\n- Flowtapes is an AI-powered video editing tool that automatically transforms raw recordings into professional-looking videos with features like silence removal, text-based editing, and automated enhancements.\n- AutoCut and Cutback are AI assistants that integrate with Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve to automate tasks including silence removal.\n\n## 2025 Benchmark Results\n\nIndependent reviews confirm that TimeBolt offers the most accurate automated cleanup among tested tools. Loom remains a convenient option for simple screen recordings but does not provide the same level of precision. For creators seeking reliable automated editing, TimeBolt delivers the most consistent results.(no content)In short-form testing, TimeBolt achieved a clean 14-second output with zero rework. Premiere missed softer pauses and low-volume fillers, leaving 21 seconds of waste. CapCut was closer but overlooked repeats like \"you know,\" adding 27 seconds of fluff.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"00969401-7627-44fa-bde9-1c8f5857e53c","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:31:01.370Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Timebolt silence removal tool features alternatives 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01AjTmxo9Q649tLfmE9jompm","content":[{"title":"Top 8 Video Silence Removers to Remove Silence from Video[2025]","url":"https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/top-video-silence-remover.html"},{"title":"Top 3 Alternatives of Timebolt for Silence Removing from Video | Snapy Blog","url":"https://www.snapy.ai/post/top-3-alternatives-of-timebolt-for-silence-removing-from-video"},{"title":"AI Video Editor Results: Descript vs Loom vs Gling vs TimeBolt","url":"https://www.timebolt.io/blog/ai-video-editor-showdown-timebolt-vs-descript-vs-loom-real-test-results"},{"title":"5 Best TimeBolt Alternatives","url":"https://getrecut.com/alternatives/timebolt/"},{"title":"AI Video Editor Showdown: TimeBolt vs CapCut vs Premiere (Short/Long)","url":"https://www.timebolt.io/blog/ai-editor-benchmark-premiere-capcut-timebolt"},{"title":"TimeBolt Review 2025: Is It the Best AI Video Tool?","url":"https://www.allaboutai.com/ai-reviews/timebolt/"},{"title":"TimeBolt Vs InVideo 2025 For Americans: Which Is Better? - All About AI","url":"https://www.allaboutai.com/comparison/timebolt-vs-invideo/"},{"title":"Pixop Vs TimeBolt 2024 For Americans: Which Is Better?","url":"https://www.allaboutai.com/comparison/pixop-vs-timebolt/"},{"title":"TimeBolt - Alternatives and Competitors","url":"https://eliteai.tools/tool/timebolt/alternatives"},{"title":"Silence Remover Software: Timebolt VS Recut | A Comparison","url":"https://www.toolify.ai/ai-news/silence-remover-software-timebolt-vs-recut-a-comparison-2248871"}]},"Based on my search, here's comprehensive information about **TimeBolt** and its alternatives for silence removal in 2025:\n\n## TimeBolt Features\n\nTimeBolt is a video and podcast editing tool designed to automatically remove silence and speed up scenes using waveform analysis.

DaVinci Resolve's unique interface and workflow require patience to master, but can produce some of the highest video quality.\n\n### 6. **Other Notable Alternatives**\n- Recut is an automatic video and audio editing application for Mac and Windows that quickly removes silent segments and saves hours of editing time.\n- Flowtapes is an AI-powered video editing tool that automatically transforms raw recordings into professional-looking videos with features like silence removal, text-based editing, and automated enhancements.\n- AutoCut and Cutback are AI assistants that integrate with Adobe Premiere Pro and DaVinci Resolve to automate tasks including silence removal.\n\n## 2025 Benchmark Results\n\nIndependent reviews confirm that TimeBolt offers the most accurate automated cleanup among tested tools. Loom remains a convenient option for simple screen recordings but does not provide the same level of precision. For creators seeking reliable automated editing, TimeBolt delivers the most consistent results.(no content)In short-form testing, TimeBolt achieved a clean 14-second output with zero rework. Premiere missed softer pauses and low-volume fillers, leaving 21 seconds of waste. CapCut was closer but overlooked repeats like \"you know,\" adding 27 seconds of fluff."],"durationSeconds":34.474962499999904}}

However, these tools struggle with maintaining consistency across multiple scenes, which is essential for creating cohesive narratives.(no content)The root of this issue lies in the limitations of current AI models. These systems lack memory and contextual awareness, meaning they cannot retain or recall details from previous scenes. As a result, creators must rely on external tools and manual adjustments to ensure continuity, making the process fragmented and labor-intensive.\n\n### 2. **Audio-Visual Synchronization**\nAvatar closeups improved dramatically while choreography still can't sync with music. That gap basically reveals what these models are trained on—tons of talking head footage but fewer examples of intentional audiovisual coordination.(no content)The 30-second clip barrier for native audio is probably the real bottleneck for narrative work.\n\n### 3. **Fragmented Workflows**\nThe typical AI video creation workflow involves multiple steps, including character creation, starting frames, video generation, audio synthesis, and final editing, highlighting the fragmented nature of the process.(no content)While this workflow can produce impressive results, it highlights the fragmented nature of current AI video tools. Each step relies on specialized software, and significant manual intervention is required to achieve a polished final product.\n\n### 4. **Timeline-Based Workflow Limitations**\nThe frustration isn't about missing AI features anymore—it's about the cognitive load of timeline-driven workflows. Creators spend more time operating tools than expressing intent. That's why the shift feels less like \"better video tools\" and more like a move toward agent-style creation.\n\n### 5. **Semantic/Intent-Driven Editing Still Underdeveloped**\nTrue semantic editing would allow the user to specify a higher level of intent (e.g., spooky vs. romantic mood) to navigate the latent space along meaningful vectors. This applies to any of the constituent media forms that come together for a full video (speech, movement, dance, action scenes, general acting, etc.).(no content)By April 2025, chat-driven editing is still in its infancy (found in new tools and research labs), but it's poised to grow.\n\n### 6. **Professional-Grade Output Limitations**\nSome tools support 1080p HD exports, which is suitable for most online platforms. However, if you're aiming for professional, broadcast-grade, or cinematic projects, they might fall short compared to higher-end tools like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro.(no content)AI video technology shows promise but remains reliant on human expertise for complex projects, with future advancements needed in memory, consistency, and usability to achieve seamless, standalone solutions.\n\n### 7. **Still Heavily Human-Dependent**\nDespite the dazzling progress in AI video generation, the reality is far messier, and far more human-dependent, than many expect. The promise of fully autonomous video creation remains tantalizingly out of reach, tangled in challenges like fragmented workflows, inconsistent narratives, and the need for painstaking manual intervention. The truth is, AI video in 2025 may be powerful, but it's far from perfect.\n\n### Summary\nIn sum: strong advances in AI video in 2025, but it's not there yet for ambitious projects.

It optimizes your workflow by automatically cutting out bad takes, silent moments, filler words, and background noise, ensuring your content is polished and engaging.\n\n### Silence & Filler Word Removal\n\nGling AI takes the hassle out of video editing by automatically detecting and removing silences & filler words like \"um\" and \"uh\", so you can spend less time editing and more time creating.(no content)Gling AI is particularly effective in removing not just simple filler words like \"um\" and \"uh,\" but also more complex phrases such as \"so as I was saying.\"(no content)Gling AI automatically detects and removes silences and filler words, making your videos sound more polished and professional. You can customize the settings to control how aggressively these elements are removed.\n\n### How It Works\n\nThink of it as an intelligent first-pass editor that automates the most tedious 80% of the work. Its primary function is to take your raw, uncut \"talking head\" footage and automatically remove silences, filler words (the 'ums' and 'ahs'), and retakes where you stumbled over your words.(no content)Gling's AI immediately starts analyzing your content, identifying speech patterns, detecting silences, and recognizing filler words like \"um,\" \"uh,\" and other verbal hesitations. The platform's advanced algorithms process your video significantly faster than real-time, typically completing analysis in just a fraction of your video's duration.\n\n### Text-Based Editing\n\nWhat sets Gling apart is its innovative text-based editing interface that transforms video editing into a process as simple as editing a Google Doc. Instead of scrubbing through timelines and manually cutting footage, creators can review an automatically generated transcript and delete unwanted sections by simply removing lines of text.\n\n### Additional Features\n\nGling AI generates captions and assists in creating SEO-friendly titles and chapters, boosting your video's accessibility and searchability. The tool automatically reduces background noise, ensuring clear and professional audio quality.(no content)Framing your subject ideally can be challenging, especially if they move around a lot.

What Features Users Want That Existing Tools Lack\n\nBased on research across user reviews, feature requests, and industry analysis:\n\n### Major Gaps Identified\n\n#### 1. **Narrative Consistency & Memory**\nCurrent AI tools cannot maintain consistency across multiple scenes. They lack memory and contextual awareness, making cohesive long-form content creation fragmented and labor-intensive.\n\n#### 2. **Audio-Visual Synchronization**\nTools can handle talking heads well but struggle with intentional audiovisual coordination like syncing choreography with music. The \"30-second clip barrier\" for native audio remains a bottleneck for narrative work.\n\n#### 3. **Unified Workflows**\nThe typical AI video workflow requires multiple specialized tools:\n- Character creation\n- Starting frames\n- Video generation\n- Audio synthesis\n- Final editing\n\nUsers want integrated solutions, not fragmented tool-hopping.\n\n#### 4. **Intent-Driven/Semantic Editing**\nUsers want to specify high-level intent (e.g., \"spooky mood\" vs. \"romantic\") rather than making granular technical adjustments. Chat-driven editing exists but is still primitive.\n\n#### 5. **Reduced Cognitive Load**\n\"The frustration isn't about missing AI features anymore—it's about the cognitive load of timeline-driven workflows. Creators spend more time operating tools than expressing intent.\"\n\n#### 6. **Professional-Grade Output**\nMany AI tools max out at 1080p HD, falling short for broadcast, cinematic, or high-end production requirements.\n\n#### 7. **Mobile Editing**\nDescript and many tools lack mobile apps. Creators want to edit on-the-go.\n\n#### 8. **Local Processing / Privacy**\nUsers want options that don't require uploading sensitive content to cloud servers.\n\n#### 9. **Transparent Pricing**\nCredit-based systems and unclear costs frustrate users. Many tools force upgrades when hitting unexpected limits.\n\n#### 10. **Reliable Customer Support**\nMultiple tools criticized for poor support, no live chat, and difficulty canceling subscriptions.\n\n#### 11. **Better Filler Word Detection Accuracy**\nEven top tools miss significant percentages of filler words or create false cuts that require manual review.\n\n#### 12. **Cross-Platform Integration**\nUsers want seamless export to their preferred NLE (Premiere, Final Cut, DaVinci) without quality loss or workflow disruption.\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Landscape Analysis\n\n### Market Positioning Map\n\n| Tool | Primary Focus | Complexity | Price Point |\n|------|---------------|------------|-------------|\n| AutoPod | Podcast multicam | Medium | $29/mo |\n| Descript | Transcript editing | Low-Medium | $12-24/mo |\n| CapCut | Social/TikTok content | Low | Free-Premium |\n| Premiere Pro | Professional NLE | High | $22.99/mo |\n| TimeBolt | Silence removal | Low | One-time + plans |\n| Gling | YouTube creators | Low | $10-15/mo |\n| DaVinci Resolve | Professional NLE | High | Free-$295 |\n\n### Key Competitive Insights\n\n1. **No single tool does it all** - Each specializes in one area\n2. **Premiere Pro plugins dominate podcast space** - AutoPod, Cutback, AutoCut all require Premiere\n3. **Descript leads transcript-based editing** - But performance and reliability issues persist\n4. **CapCut dominates consumer/social** - Free tier makes it accessible but limited for pros\n5. **Silence removal is commoditized** - Multiple tools do it well; differentiation is marginal\n6. **Multicam auto-switching is emerging** - DaVinci Resolve 20, Descript, Cutback all offer this\n\n---\n\n## Gaps SPLICE Could Fill\n\nBased on this analysis, here are strategic opportunities:\n\n### 1. **Unified Workflow Engine**\nCreate an integrated solution that combines:\n- Silence/filler removal\n- Multicam speaker switching\n- Transcript-based editing\n- Social clip generation\n\nNo tool currently does all four well in one place.\n\n### 2. **Intent-Based Editing Interface**\nMove beyond transcript editing to true semantic control:\n- \"Make this section more energetic\"\n- \"Find the best quotes about [topic]\"\n- \"Create a highlight reel emphasizing [theme]\"\n\n### 3. **Local-First Processing**\nAddress privacy concerns with on-device AI processing. Current tools are cloud-dependent.\n\n### 4. **NLE-Agnostic Workflow**\nRather than being a Premiere-only plugin, create a preprocessing tool that exports to any NLE with perfect round-tripping.\n\n### 5. **Long-Form Consistency**\nSolve the narrative memory problem. Track speakers, topics, and context across an entire project rather than clip-by-clip.\n\n### 6. **Professional Output Quality**\nTarget 4K+ with broadcast-quality output, filling the gap between consumer tools (CapCut) and complex NLEs (Premiere/DaVinci).\n\n### 7. **Transparent, Fair Pricing**\nAvoid credit systems. Offer clear limits, no surprise charges, easy cancellation.\n\n### 8. **Hybrid Automation + Control**\nAutoPod and TimeBolt automate heavily but require Premiere for fine control. Descript offers control but is slow. Bridge this gap with smart defaults that are instantly adjustable.\n\n### 9. **Mobile Companion**\nEnable mobile review/approval/quick editing while heavy processing happens on desktop.\n\n### 10. **Better Filler Word Intelligence**\nCurrent tools have ~94% satisfaction with filler removal. Push toward 99% with context-aware detection (knowing when \"so\" is a filler vs. meaningful).\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [AutoPod Official Site](https://www.autopod.fm/)\n- [AutoPod Trustpilot Reviews](https://www.trustpilot.com/review/www.autopod.fm)\n- [AutoPod Review - VidPros](https://vidpros.com/autopod-review-ai-editing-for-podcasts-worth-it/)\n- [Descript Official Site](https://www.descript.com/)\n- [Descript Review 2025 - VidMeToo](https://www.vidmetoo.com/descript-review/)\n- [Descript Reviews - Capterra](https://www.capterra.com/p/230702/Descript/reviews/)\n- [Descript Reviews - G2](https://www.g2.com/products/descript/reviews)\n- [Descript Review - Work From Your Laptop](https://workfromyourlaptop.com/descript-review/)\n- [CapCut Auto Cut Guide](https://www.capcut.com/resource/capcut-auto-cut)\n- [CapCut AutoCut Ultimate Guide - Miracamp](https://www.miracamp.com/learn/capcut/the-ultimate-guide-to-autocut)\n- [Adobe Speech to Text Guide](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/speech-to-text.html)\n- [Adobe Text-Based Editing](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/video/text-based-editing-video.html)\n- [TimeBolt AI Editor Comparison](https://www.timebolt.io/blog/ai-video-editor-showdown-timebolt-vs-descript-vs-loom-real-test-results)\n- [TimeBolt vs CapCut vs Premiere Benchmark](https://www.timebolt.io/blog/ai-editor-benchmark-premiere-capcut-timebolt)\n- [Top Video Silence Removers - Filmora](https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editing-tips/top-video-silence-remover.html)\n- [Recut Alternatives](https://getrecut.com/alternatives/timebolt/)\n- [Gling AI Official Site](https://www.gling.ai/)\n- [Gling AI 2025 Review - Skywork](https://skywork.ai/skypage/en/Gling-AI-Deep-Dive-An-In-Depth-2025-Review-of-Features,-Performance,-and-Future-Trends/1972869354363744256)\n- [AI Video Limitations 2025 - Geeky Gadgets](https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/ai-video-creation-limitations-2025/)\n- [AI Video Editor Trends 2025 - Metricool](https://metricool.com/ai-video-editor-trends/)\n- [Best AI Video Editors Comparison - Renderforest](https://www.renderforest.com/blog/best-ai-video-editors)\n- [DaVinci Resolve 20 Features](https://www.coremicro.com/blogs/news/davinci-resolve-studio-20-now-available-ai-powered-editing-at-coremicro)\n- [Descript Automatic Multicam](https://www.descript.com/ai/automatic-multicam)\n- [Cutback Multicam Guide](https://cutback.video/blog/how-to-edit-multicam-footage-automatically-in-premiere-pro-(2025-guide))\n- [Best Multi-cam Editing Plugins - Cutback](https://cutback.video/blog/best-multi-cam-editing-plugins-for-premiere-pro-users)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1214,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1636,"cache_read_input_tokens":24137,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1636,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWAgtk9hPbVEH2o1p5M4v","type":"assistant","uuid":"c64cb523-1cc2-4726-8158-e84e432de2d3","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:35:18.806Z"}
