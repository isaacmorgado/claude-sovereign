It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.\n\n### Key Resources\n\n1. **Official Documentation**: The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/\n\n2. **Current Status**: As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n3. **Version Information**: UXP is the next generation of APIs, for Premiere v25.6 and beyond.\n\n### API Types Available\n\nThere are two main API types: UXP Core APIs for building user interfaces, file operations, network calls, and general functionality, and Premiere APIs for interacting with and modifying Premiere projects and sequences. Most often you will need to use both APIs together to create the functionality you want.\n\n### Key Differences from ExtendScript\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### Timeline Editing Limitations\n\nThere is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks. Premiere Pro no longer includes a keyboard mappable command like \"Move Clip Up/Down Between Tracks.\"(no content)The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin, the right starting point for any future integrations, shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\n### Recent API Updates (March 2025)\n\nThere have been updates for UXP APIs available in Premiere Pro Beta, including ClipProjectItem API for attaching proxy or high resolution footage, EncoderManager API for getting file extensions based on input sequence and preset, and SequenceEditor APIs.\n\n### Sample Code & Development\n\nThe UXP Developer Tool is available for download through Creative Cloud Desktop.

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n\n## Key Details\n\n### Current Status\nThe Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP) has officially graduated from beta and is now available in Adobe Premiere 25.6. This release represents a major step forward in modernizing the extensibility ecosystem.(no content)As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP. ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n### Platform Capabilities\nUXP is a JavaScript-based extensibility platform (ES6/ECMAScript 2015 compliant) that helps automate, optimize, and extend the capabilities of Adobe Creative Cloud products. It represents a comprehensive solution that lets you use Web technologies to build new features and tools for Desktop applications.(no content)UXP is the current extensibility standard for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, supported by a constantly growing set of applications, including Premiere (version 25.6), Photoshop, and InDesign.\n\n### API Architecture\nUXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment.(no content)An important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, which blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous and does not block the UI thread.

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n\n## Key Details\n\n### Current Status\nThe Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP) has officially graduated from beta and is now available in Adobe Premiere 25.6. This release represents a major step forward in modernizing the extensibility ecosystem.(no content)As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP. ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n### Platform Capabilities\nUXP is a JavaScript-based extensibility platform (ES6/ECMAScript 2015 compliant) that helps automate, optimize, and extend the capabilities of Adobe Creative Cloud products. It represents a comprehensive solution that lets you use Web technologies to build new features and tools for Desktop applications.(no content)UXP is the current extensibility standard for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, supported by a constantly growing set of applications, including Premiere (version 25.6), Photoshop, and InDesign.\n\n### API Architecture\nUXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment.(no content)An important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, which blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous and does not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition between the ExtendScript DOM and the UXP DOM, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### Version Compatibility\nEach Premiere release integrates a specific UXP version. For example, Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.\n\n### Resources\n- **Official Documentation**: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/\n- **Sample Plugins**: The documentation is available at developer.adobe.com, along with the UXP Developer Tool available for download through Creative Cloud Desktop, and Adobe third-party sample panels in the premiere-api directory.\n- The Creative Cloud Developer Forums remain the best place to ask questions, help fellow developers, and share feedback."],"durationSeconds":24.176307041999987}}

Current State of UXP Support in Premiere Pro\n\n**Status: General Availability (GA) as of Premiere Pro v25.6**\n\n- UXP officially graduated from beta in December 2025 and is now available in Premiere Pro version 25.6\n- Premiere Pro v25.6 includes UXP v8.1\n- UXP is a JavaScript-based extensibility platform (ES6/ECMAScript 2015 compliant)\n- ExtendScript-based integrations remain supported through September 2026\n- CEP 12 shipped with Premiere Pro 25.0, and will be the last major CEP update\n\n**Key Technical Improvements over CEP:**\n- Single runtime environment (no CSInterface bridge needed)\n- Asynchronous method calls that do not block the UI thread\n- Properties (get/set) remain synchronous for easier migration from ExtendScript\n\n---\n\n## 2. Timeline/Editing APIs Available in UXP\n\n**SequenceEditor API** - The primary class for timeline manipulation:\n- `createInsertProjectItemAction()` - Insert a project item into a sequence at specified time/tracks\n- `createOverwriteItemAction()` - Overwrite sequence content with a project item\n- `createRemoveItemsAction()` - Remove track items with ripple and shift options\n- `createCloneTrackItemAction()` - Duplicate track items with offset adjustments\n\n**Additional APIs:**\n- **Sequence** - Access sequences, tracks, and selections\n- **TrackItemSelection** - Get selected track items via `getTrackItems()` and `sequence.getSelection()`\n- **ClipProjectItem** - Attach proxy footage, change media paths\n- **EncoderManager** - Export workflows, get file extensions\n- **ProjectUtils** - Project view management (`getProjectViewIds()`, `getProjectFromViewId()`)\n\n**What You CAN Do:**\n- Place track items in sequences\n- Clone and remove track items\n- Insert/overwrite clips at specific timecode positions\n- Export sequences via presets\n- Work with markers and metadata (on project items)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Known Limitations - Specifically Razor/Cut Functionality\n\n**CRITICAL LIMITATION: No Razor Tool API**\n\nAn Adobe employee has confirmed: \"There is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool.\"\n\n**Detailed Limitations:**\n\n| Feature | UXP Support | Notes |\n|---------|-------------|-------|\n| Razor/Split clips | NO | Not available in UXP, CEP, or ExtendScript DOM |\n| Move clips between tracks | NO | No vertical track movement API exists |\n| Markers on track items | PARTIAL | Markers attach to project items, not individual track items |\n| Spectrum Web Components | PARTIAL | Not fully supported for Premiere Pro |\n| Command Plugins | NO | Do not work as standalone plugins yet |\n\n**Workarounds for Cutting:**\n1. **QE DOM** has a `razor()` method but is unsupported and not recommended\n2. **Alternative approach**: Instead of cutting, insert clips multiple times with different in/out points to simulate cuts\n3. Clone track items and adjust their in/out points manually\n\n---\n\n## 4. Official Roadmap for UXP Features\n\n**No Public Roadmap Exists**\n\nAdobe has not published a formal roadmap. Their official position is:\n\n> \"This general release is just the beginning for UXP in Premiere. We want your input to help prioritize what comes next.\"\n\n**How to Influence the Roadmap:**\n- Submit feature requests on [Creative Cloud Developer Forums](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/)\n- Attend monthly office hours\n- Share use cases and feedback on the forums\n\n**Known Upcoming Items:**\n- Adobe Media Encoder (AME) UXP support coming soon\n- Continued API expansion based on developer feedback\n- Full third-party development workflow support (currently limited in some areas)\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Aspect | Status |\n|--------|--------|\n| UXP Version | v8.1 (in Premiere 25.6) |\n| Release Status | General Availability (December 2025) |\n| ExtendScript Support | Continues through September 2026 |\n| Razor/Cut API | Not available |\n| Track movement API | Not available |\n| Insert/Overwrite/Remove APIs | Available |\n| Clone track items | Available |\n| Public roadmap | None (community-driven prioritization) |\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [The Premiere UXP API - Official Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n- [Premiere and UXP Introduction](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/)\n- [Premiere API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [SequenceEditor Class Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/sequenceeditor/)\n- [UXP Change Log](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/changelog/)\n- [Adobe Community: UXP Razor Tool Discussion](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-razor-tool-and-marking-clipped-sections/td-p/15547922)\n- [Creative Cloud Developer Forums - UXP API Updates](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/update-of-uxp-apis-inside-of-premiere-pro/10384)\n- [GitHub: UXP Premiere Pro Samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":36,"cache_creation_input_tokens":779,"cache_read_input_tokens":21436,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":779,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWJpAMH5GUWij6rpiZdiW","type":"assistant","uuid":"edd6401f-deba-4b9a-a966-351b1b1755f8","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:34:23.825Z"}
