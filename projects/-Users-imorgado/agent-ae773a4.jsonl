Realtime polls Postgres' built-in replication functionality for database changes, converts changes to JSON, then broadcasts the JSON over websockets to authorized clients.\n\n## Key Architecture Details\n\nSupabase's Realtime functionality is a key differentiator, enabling live updates for chat applications, collaborative tools, and dashboards. Their architecture leverages PostgreSQL's Logical Replication feature to stream database changes. Unlike physical replication, which sends binary files, logical replication transmits data changes (inserts, updates, deletes) as logical messages, allowing for fine-grained, table-level subscriptions.(no content)The core of this system involves Supabase creating replication slots on PostgreSQL to stream Write-Ahead Log (WAL) entries. These WAL entries are then parsed and emitted as JSON payloads to clients over WebSocket connections. This design allows for horizontal scalability by decoupling the database from the real-time delivery layer, supporting multiple subscribers with minimal overhead.\n\n## Realtime Capabilities\n\nThe Realtime server is built with Elixir using the Phoenix Framework and enables the following functionality: Broadcast (send ephemeral messages from client to clients with low latency), Presence (track and synchronize shared state between clients), and Postgres Changes (listen to Postgres database changes and send them to authorized clients).\n\n## Implementation Features\n\nSupabase allows you to create real-time subscriptions for any table or view in your database. This feature is particularly useful for building real-time applications like live voting systems or collaborative tools. Every time there's a data change, the updates are automatically sent to your app in real-time.(no content)Supabase implements a channel-based pub/sub system where clients subscribe to specific tables or rows, receiving updates only when relevant changes occur.\n\n## 2024 Platform Updates\n\nSupabase's migration to a v2 platform architecture, completed for paid plans and gradually rolled out to free plans from March 2024, shifts services to a multi-tenant model, where a single instance serves many projects. This aims to free up resources for the PostgreSQL databases, enable more resource-intensive features, and pave the way for capabilities like zero-downtime scaling.\n\n## Connection Limits\n\nThe free tier allows 500 concurrent Realtime connections, with higher limits on paid plans.\n\nFor implementing a leaderboard specifically, you would typically:\n1. Create a scores/leaderboard table in PostgreSQL\n2. Subscribe to changes on that table using Supabase Realtime\n3. Use the channel-based pub/sub to push score updates to all connected clients instantly\n\nThe search didn't return a specific leaderboard tutorial, but the Realtime functionality is well-suited for this use case using the standard subscription pattern.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"09e0a53f-a5ae-48ac-a48f-5cebaf6b7152","timestamp":"2025-12-24T00:38:22.043Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Supabase realtime leaderboard implementation PostgreSQL 2024 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01S9hr281j8QqsdqcfT7q52K","content":[{"title":"Supabase | The Postgres Development Platform.","url":"https://supabase.com/"},{"title":"Serverless PostgreSQL 2025: The Truth About Supabase, Neon, and PlanetScale - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/dataformathub/serverless-postgresql-2025-the-truth-about-supabase-neon-and-planetscale-7lf"},{"title":"Changelog","url":"https://supabase.com/changelog"},{"title":"Top 13 Supabase Features You Should Know In 2024 | Lanex AU","url":"https://lanex.au/blog/top-13-supabase-features-you-should-know-in-2024/"},{"title":"GitHub - supabase/realtime: Broadcast, Presence, and Postgres Changes via WebSockets","url":"https://github.com/supabase/realtime"},{"title":"GitHub - supabase/supabase: The Postgres development platform.

It is built by former indie developers, comes with lots of ready-made features out-of-the-box, and has simple, success-based pricing system.\n\n## Features\n\nIn addition to traditional backend and live ops features like asset catalog and player managers, microtransactions, leaderboards, and player segmentation, LootLocker also includes game systems like progression, missions, crafting, character classes, and collectables.(no content)Alongside all the traditional backend and live ops you expect, they also have loads of extra systems you can easily integrate and manage through LootLocker. So whether you're installing the SDK, adding in-game currency or leaderboards, or creating a progression system, you won't have to spend hours on configuration or building custom logic.\n\n## Leaderboard Features\n\nTheir popular Leaderboards feature, known for its ease of implementation and cross-platform compatibility, has been updated to now include scheduled resets and rewards.(no content)An entry on a leaderboard is called a member. Since it's possible to have leaderboards for all kinds of cases it doesn't make sense to use players here. Because of that member_id can be whatever you want as long as it makes sense in your game. For lots of cases using the players ID will make good sense, but you can imagine a case where you would rank different clans/guilds against each other.

It is built by former indie developers, comes with lots of ready-made features out-of-the-box, and has simple, success-based pricing system.\n\n## Features\n\nIn addition to traditional backend and live ops features like asset catalog and player managers, microtransactions, leaderboards, and player segmentation, LootLocker also includes game systems like progression, missions, crafting, character classes, and collectables.(no content)Alongside all the traditional backend and live ops you expect, they also have loads of extra systems you can easily integrate and manage through LootLocker. So whether you're installing the SDK, adding in-game currency or leaderboards, or creating a progression system, you won't have to spend hours on configuration or building custom logic.\n\n## Leaderboard Features\n\nTheir popular Leaderboards feature, known for its ease of implementation and cross-platform compatibility, has been updated to now include scheduled resets and rewards.(no content)An entry on a leaderboard is called a member. Since it's possible to have leaderboards for all kinds of cases it doesn't make sense to use players here. Because of that member_id can be whatever you want as long as it makes sense in your game. For lots of cases using the players ID will make good sense, but you can imagine a case where you would rank different clans/guilds against each other. In that case you would use clan/guild ID as member_id.\n\n## Pricing\n\nThey're always upfront about the money stuff. Their pricing is easy to understand and only goes up when the success of your game does too. They've even got a super-simple calculator so you can predict how much LootLocker will cost when your game's successful.(no content)You only need to start paying when your game's a hit – that means more than 10,000 players a month.(no content)In May 2025, LootLocker announced a new pricing model that's designed to scale with your game, support developers and publishers of all sizes, and introduce a new free non-commercial license for students and hobbyists.\n\n## APIs Available\n\nIn addition to their Game API, you also have access to their Server and Admin APIs – so you'll have as much control over the game backend as you could ever need.\n\nFor the most current and detailed pricing information, I'd recommend visiting LootLocker's official website directly, as they recently updated their pricing model in May 2025."],"durationSeconds":29.296562791999982}}

They're a fun way to drive competition among your players. The server supports an unlimited number of individual leaderboards with each one as a scoreboard which tracks separate records.(no content)Leaderboards are dynamic in the server because they don't need to be preconfigured like would be needed if you've used Google Play Games or Apple Game Center in the past. A leaderboard can be created via server-side code. Each leaderboard is a collection of records where each record is a ranked score with metadata. A leaderboard is uniquely identified by an ID.\n\n### Sort Order & Operators\nLeaderboard records are sorted based on their configured sort order: DESC (default) or ASC. The sort order is decided when a leaderboard is created and cannot be changed later.(no content)You can configure how leaderboard record scores are set using the following operator values: set - The value will be set to the submitted score; best - The value will only be updated if the score being submitted is higher than the existing score; incr - The value will be incremented by the score being submitted; decr - The value will be decreased by the score being submitted.\n\n### Authoritative Leaderboards\nCreating an authoritative leaderboard means that clients will not be able to submit scores directly to the leaderboard, all submissions must be made via the server runtime. By default leaderboards are not authoritative, meaning that clients can submit scores directly to the leaderboard.\n\n### Reset Schedule\nYou can assign each leaderboard an optional reset schedule. Records contained in the leaderboard will expire based on this schedule and users will be able to submit new scores for each reset cycle.\n\n### Metadata & Records\nThe score in each record can be updated as the owner progresses. Scores can be updated as often as wanted and can increase or decrease. A record has some builtin fields like lang, location, and timezone. These values are used to filter leaderboard results.(no content)Each record can optionally include additional data about the score or the owner when submitted. The extra fields must be JSON encoded and submitted as the metadata. A good use case for metadata is info about race conditions in a driving game, such as weather, which can give extra UI hints when users list scores.\n\n### Best Practices & Performance\nLeaderboards are efficient to store, fast to recalculate—thanks to in-memory caching and ranking—and flexible enough for any sortable scoreboard.(no content)From a storage perspective, Nakama writes leaderboard details to the database as an authoritative, permanent record of the leaderboard's configuration. Meanwhile, Nakama creates an in-memory cache of the leaderboard for live sorting.\n\n### Sample Project Features\nThe official sample project demonstrates: Create weekly resetting leaderboards or global persistent leaderboards. Real-time score updates. Different ways to submit scores (best, set, increment, decrement). Primary and sub-scores for tie-breaking.\n\n### Documentation Links\n- Main documentation: https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/concepts/leaderboards/\n- Best practices: https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/concepts/leaderboards/best-practices/\n- Custom leaderboards guide: https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/guides/concepts/custom-leaderboards/\n- Sample project: https://heroiclabs.com/docs/sample-projects/unity/nakama-leaderboards/\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ad4d80f9-a7df-43b9-a9e3-b3b4ae372bc5","timestamp":"2025-12-24T00:38:24.330Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Nakama game server leaderboard features documentation 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_012JHeKqpYBu5kBLiXrZ3QqJ","content":[{"title":"Leaderboards - Heroic Labs Documentation","url":"https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/concepts/leaderboards/"},{"title":"Leaderboards - Nakama server","url":"https://heroiclabs.github.io/nakama-docs/gameplay-leaderboards/"},{"title":"nakama-docs/docs/nakama/concepts/leaderboards.md at master · heroiclabs/nakama-docs","url":"https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama-docs/blob/master/docs/nakama/concepts/leaderboards.md"},{"title":"JavaScript - Heroic Labs Documentation","url":"https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/client-libraries/javascript/"},{"title":"Nakama Leaderboards Sample Project - Heroic Labs Documentation","url":"https://heroiclabs.com/docs/sample-projects/unity/nakama-leaderboards/"},{"title":"Leaderboards Best Practices - Heroic Labs Documentation","url":"https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/concepts/leaderboards/best-practices/"},{"title":"Custom Leaderboards - Heroic Labs Documentation","url":"https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/guides/concepts/custom-leaderboards/"},{"title":"nakama/server/core_leaderboard.go at master · heroiclabs/nakama","url":"https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/blob/master/server/core_leaderboard.go"},{"title":"nakama/server/leaderboard_cache.go at master · heroiclabs/nakama","url":"https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama/blob/master/server/leaderboard_cache.go"},{"title":"Nakama: The leading open source game server for studios and publishers - Heroic Labs","url":"https://heroiclabs.com/nakama/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about Nakama game server leaderboard features:\n\n## Nakama Leaderboard Features\n\n### Core Features\nLeaderboards are a great way to add a social and competitive element to any game.

Reads include queries, simple fetches, and updates through realtime listeners. You're also charged for any reads required to evaluate Cloud Firestore Security Rules.(no content)You're also charged for the amount of storage that your database uses, including overhead for metadata and indexes, and the amount of network bandwidth that you use.\n\n### Pricing Rates\n\nRead operations are priced at $0.03 per 100,000 documents in US regions.(no content)Cloud Firestore offers free usage of 1 GiB of storage and 50,000 reads per day. Beyond this, costs are approximately $0.06 per 100,000 reads and $0.18 per GiB stored.\n\n### Free Tier (Spark Plan)\n\nCloud Firestore offers free quota that lets you get started at no cost. If you need more quota, you must enable billing for your Google Cloud project. Quotas are applied daily and reset around midnight Pacific time.(no content)Cloud Firestore allows exactly one free database per project.\n\n### Pricing Calculator\n\nYou can use the Google Cloud calculator to estimate project costs.(no content)Firebase also offers a pricing calculator to get an estimate for your monthly costs on the Blaze plan.\n\n### How Operations Are Counted\n\nFor writes, each set or update operation counts as a single write.(no content)You are charged one read operation for each batch of up to 1000 index entries read by a query.\n\n### Enterprise Edition (Different Model)\n\nFor Enterprise edition, read operations consume read units, which are calculated in 4 KiB tranches.(no content)Write operations consume write units, which are calculated in 1 KiB tranches.\n\n### Real-World Cost Estimates\n\nFirestore and Cloud Functions with light to moderate usage beyond free limits (reads, writes, function invocations) adds another $50–$100/month, depending on usage patterns.(no content)Firestore is often the biggest cost driver. Reads/writes are double older estimates; high-volume apps can see thousands per month in costs.\n\n### Cost Optimization Tips\n\nTo reduce costs, denormalize data, cache intelligently, and batch queries to minimize document access.(no content)Transactions ensure data integrity but generate multiple reads/writes per operation. Use sparingly to control costs.\n\nFor the most accurate and up-to-date pricing for your specific region, visit the [Google Cloud Firestore pricing page](https://cloud.google.com/firestore/pricing) or use the [Firebase pricing calculator](https://firebase.google.com/pricing).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e7b2f785-6807-4a65-8251-d389fc361b3a","timestamp":"2025-12-24T00:38:58.785Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Firebase Firestore pricing reads writes cost calculator 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_012Gz6jt9wYH4bVVPpytf1Jb","content":[{"title":"See a Cloud Firestore pricing example | Firebase","url":"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/billing-example"},{"title":"Understand Cloud Firestore billing | Firebase","url":"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/pricing"},{"title":"Firestore pricing | Google Cloud","url":"https://cloud.google.com/firestore/pricing"},{"title":"Explore Firebase’s free vs Blaze tiers, real-world cost examples, hidden charges, and compare with Auth0/Okta for transparent pricing clarity.","url":"https://supertokens.com/blog/firebase-pricing"},{"title":"Pricing examples | Firestore | Firebase","url":"https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/enterprise/pricing-examples"},{"title":"Firebase Pricing","url":"https://firebase.google.com/pricing"},{"title":"Google Firestore Pricing Guide: Real-World Costs & Optimization Tips | Airbyte","url":"https://airbyte.com/data-engineering-resources/google-firestore-pricing"},{"title":"Firebase Costs: A Comprehensive Breakdown | by Cando Consulting | Medium","url":"https://candoconsulting.medium.com/firebase-costs-a-comprehensive-breakdown-27da1c403873"},{"title":"Understanding Firebase Costs for Apps with Over 10 Million Active Users in 2024 - Genspark","url":"https://www.genspark.ai/spark/understanding-firebase-costs-for-apps-with-over-10-million-active-users-in-2024/28e6aff7-9158-4141-8144-8e321e6740dd"},{"title":"Firebase Pricing and Cost Management","url":"https://the-pi-guy.com/blog/firebase_pricing_and_cost_management/"}]},"Here's what I found about Firebase Firestore pricing for reads, writes, and cost calculation:\n\n## Firebase Firestore Pricing Overview\n\n### How You're Charged\n\nWhen you use Cloud Firestore, you are charged for the number of documents you read, write, and delete, as well as the number of index entries read to satisfy a query.

It's incredibly generous and allows you to build and launch a full application without paying a dime. It's perfect for prototyping, hackathons, and building out an MVP.(no content)The free plan includes auth, database, file storage, and limited edge functions.(no content)Free tier includes up to 10k MAUs, 500MB database, and 1GB file storage, with basic Realtime and Auth.\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Projects on the free plan that are inactive for 7 days will be paused.\n- No PITR or backups, no HIPAA/SOC 2, limited Edge Function usage, and no SSO or custom domains.\n\n### Pro Plan\nSupabase pricing for the pro tier starts at $25 per month.(no content)Pro ($25/month) is the default choice for solo devs, indie projects, or early-stage startups. Importantly, the Pro tier includes $10 of compute credit and turns on spend caps by default, so your bill stays predictable.(no content)The Pro plan is the standard choice for any serious application going into production. For a base fee, you get significantly higher limits, daily backups, no project pausing, and the ability to scale your usage as your app grows.(no content)The Pro plan introduces the concept of usage-based billing for almost every feature.\n\n### Team Plan\nSupabase pricing for the team tier begins at $599 per month.(no content)Team ($599/month) is where compliance kicks in. You get SSO, SOC 2 reports, longer backup retention, and log storage for 28 days. You're not paying for more compute, you're paying for enterprise grade security.(no content)Best for development agencies, larger companies with multiple development teams, and businesses needing features like SSO and detailed audit logs.\n\n### Enterprise Plan\nThe Enterprise plan is a fully custom solution for organizations with specific, large-scale requirements around security, compliance, and support. Cost is custom pricing based on a dedicated contract.\n\n## Pricing Model\nSupabase uses what's called a hybrid pricing model: base fee with usage-based charges. That means you pay a fixed monthly fee for a base plan, then pay extra if you cross certain usage limits.(no content)Supabase pairs plan-based quotas with usage-based overages at known unit rates (MAU, egress, DB/file storage). Quotas are organization-scoped and aggregate across projects for a single invoice.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"23893370-0344-4e0a-ab8a-fb1f2f4fda2f","timestamp":"2025-12-24T00:39:00.292Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Supabase pricing free tier paid plans 2024 2025 cost","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01DBTcfR7grrpBRwW3C6boqC","content":[{"title":"Pricing & Fees | Supabase","url":"https://supabase.com/pricing"},{"title":"About billing on Supabase | Supabase Docs","url":"https://supabase.com/docs/guides/platform/billing-on-supabase"},{"title":"Supabase Pricing 2025: Free, Pro & Enterprise Costs | MetaCTO","url":"https://www.metacto.com/blogs/the-true-cost-of-supabase-a-comprehensive-guide-to-pricing-integration-and-maintenance"},{"title":"Supabase Pricing in 2025: Full Breakdown of Plans | UI Bakery Blog","url":"https://uibakery.io/blog/supabase-pricing"},{"title":"Orb | Supabase pricing model: How it works and how Orb helped","url":"https://www.withorb.com/blog/supabase-pricing"},{"title":"Supabase Pricing vs Codehooks (2025): All-Inclusive Plans with Compute - codehooks.io","url":"https://codehooks.io/docs/alternatives/supabase-pricing-comparison"},{"title":"The Complete Guide to Supabase Pricing Models and Cost Optimization","url":"https://flexprice.io/blog/supabase-pricing-breakdown"},{"title":"Supabase Pricing: What You Really Need to Know 💡 - Supadex","url":"https://www.supadex.app/blog/supabase-pricing-what-you-really-need-to-know"},{"title":"Supabase vs AWS: Database Pricing Comparison in 2025","url":"https://www.bytebase.com/blog/supabase-vs-aws-database-pricing/"},{"title":"Supabase vs AWS: Feature and Pricing Comparison (2025)","url":"https://www.bytebase.com/blog/supabase-vs-aws-pricing/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive overview of Supabase pricing for 2024/2025:\n\n## Supabase Pricing Plans\n\nSupabase offers different subscription plans—Free, Pro, Team, and Enterprise.\n\n### Free Tier\nThe Free plan is one of Supabase's most attractive features.

It costs $600/mo for the lowest plan. They're clearly targeting bigger games that are generating enough revenue month over month to justify that cost.(no content)Heroic Cloud offers hosted Nakama and Satori on their platform with automated scale out.(no content)They also offer smaller tiers for development with burstable CPU, micro database, and continuous integration.(no content)Heroic Labs offers a flexible pricing model, including a free tier for indie developers, and custom plans for larger-scale games.\n\n### What Heroic Cloud Includes:\n- A project includes a pre-configured Satori project or Nakama instance, a database, load balancers, DNS records and more.

It costs $600/mo for the lowest plan. They're clearly targeting bigger games that are generating enough revenue month over month to justify that cost.(no content)Heroic Cloud offers hosted Nakama and Satori on their platform with automated scale out.(no content)They also offer smaller tiers for development with burstable CPU, micro database, and continuous integration.(no content)Heroic Labs offers a flexible pricing model, including a free tier for indie developers, and custom plans for larger-scale games.\n\n### What Heroic Cloud Includes:\n- A project includes a pre-configured Satori project or Nakama instance, a database, load balancers, DNS records and more. They bundle Nakama Enterprise licenses as part of your project deployment.\n- Heroic Cloud handles the uptime, replication, backups, logs, data upgrades, and all other tasks involved with production server environments.\n- Heroic Labs has achieved SOC 2 Type II compliance certification, providing independent validation that their security controls meet enterprise standards.\n\n## Self-Hosted Nakama\n\nThe beauty of Open Source is that you don't have to host on the Heroic Cloud - you can host anywhere you want.(no content)Hosting Nakama doesn't have to break the bank. With options like Digital Ocean or even a basic VPS, indie developers can launch scalable game backends for as little as $10/month.\n\n### Self-Hosting Requirements:\n- Nakama can be run on instance types as small as \"g1-small\" on Google Cloud although they recommend a minimum of \"n1-standard-1\" in production.

Supabase Realtime\n\n**Best for:** Teams wanting PostgreSQL-native solution with managed real-time capabilities\n\n### Integration with Existing PostgreSQL\n- **Medium complexity** - Requires migrating to or syncing with Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL\n- You would need to either: (a) migrate your Railway PostgreSQL to Supabase, or (b) use Supabase as an additional database specifically for leaderboards\n- Native PostgreSQL means your existing SQL knowledge transfers directly\n\n### Real-Time Capabilities\n- Built on Elixir/Phoenix with WebSocket subscriptions\n- Uses PostgreSQL Logical Replication to stream changes\n- Supports `postgres_changes` events for INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE\n- Channel-based pub/sub system\n\n### Code Example (from Supabase repos):\n```typescript\nimport { createClient } from '@supabase/supabase-js'\n\nconst supabase = createClient(SUPABASE_URL, SUPABASE_ANON_KEY)\n\n// Subscribe to leaderboard changes\nconst channel = supabase\n  .channel('leaderboard')\n  .on(\n    'postgres_changes',\n    {\n      event: 'UPDATE',\n      schema: 'public',\n      table: 'scores',\n    },\n    (payload) => {\n      // Handle real-time score update\n      updateLeaderboard(payload.new)\n    }\n  )\n  .subscribe()\n```\n\n### Pricing at Scale\n| Users | Plan | Estimated Cost |\n|-------|------|----------------|\n| 10k MAU | Pro | ~$25-50/month |\n| 100k MAU | Pro | ~$50-150/month (usage-based) |\n\n- Free tier: 500 concurrent realtime connections, 500MB database\n- Pro: $25/month base + usage overages\n- Team: $599/month (SOC 2, SSO)\n\n### Pros\n- Native PostgreSQL (familiar SQL)\n- Generous free tier\n- Built-in auth, storage, edge functions\n- Active development and community\n\n### Cons\n- Requires separate database or migration from Railway\n- Not designed specifically for gaming/leaderboards\n\n**Sources:** [Supabase Pricing](https://supabase.com/pricing), [Supabase Realtime Docs](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime/getting_started), [Supabase GitHub](https://github.com/supabase/realtime)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Firebase/Firestore\n\n**Best for:** Teams prioritizing ease of setup over cost optimization\n\n### Integration with Existing PostgreSQL\n- **Low** - Firestore is a separate NoSQL database (not PostgreSQL-compatible)\n- Would require maintaining two databases or migrating entirely\n- Data sync between PostgreSQL and Firestore adds complexity\n\n### Real-Time Capabilities\n- Native real-time listeners with `onSnapshot()`\n- Automatic sync across all connected clients\n- Supports offline persistence\n\n### Leaderboard Implementation Approaches (Official Firebase):\n1. **Simple Query**: `orderBy()` + `limit()` - works for small datasets\n2. **Periodically-Updating**: Store rank in document, update via Cloud Functions\n3. **Tree-Based Search**: For O(log n) rank lookups\n4. **COUNT Aggregation**: Scales to ~1M users\n\n### Code Example:\n```typescript\nimport { collection, query, orderBy, limit, onSnapshot } from 'firebase/firestore'\n\nconst leaderboardQuery = query(\n  collection(db, 'scores'),\n  orderBy('score', 'desc'),\n  limit(100)\n)\n\nconst unsubscribe = onSnapshot(leaderboardQuery, (snapshot) => {\n  const scores = snapshot.docs.map(doc => ({\n    id: doc.id,\n    ...doc.data()\n  }))\n  setLeaderboard(scores)\n})\n```\n\n### Pricing at Scale\n| Users | Estimated Monthly Cost |\n|-------|------------------------|\n| 10k MAU | $20-100 (depends on read/write patterns) |\n| 100k MAU | $200-1000+ |\n\n- Pricing: $0.03-0.06 per 100k reads\n- Free tier: 50k reads/day, 20k writes/day\n- **Warning:** Leaderboards can be expensive due to high read counts\n\n### Pros\n- Excellent documentation and official leaderboard tutorials\n- Native real-time sync\n- Google Cloud ecosystem integration\n\n### Cons\n- NoSQL - incompatible with your PostgreSQL backend\n- Cost can explode with high-frequency leaderboard reads\n- Per-operation pricing is unpredictable\n\n**Sources:** [Firebase Leaderboard Codelab](https://firebase.google.com/codelabs/build-leaderboards-with-firestore), [Firebase Leaderboard Pathway](https://firebase.google.com/learn/pathways/firebase-leaderboards-with-firestore), [Firestore Pricing](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/pricing)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Nakama (Open Source Game Server)\n\n**Best for:** Game-focused applications needing comprehensive backend features\n\n### Integration with Existing PostgreSQL\n- **High compatibility** - Uses CockroachDB or PostgreSQL-compatible database\n- Could potentially share your Railway PostgreSQL instance\n- Designed for game backends with leaderboards as first-class feature\n\n### Real-Time Capabilities\n- WebSocket-based real-time communication\n- Built-in matchmaking, chat, and presence\n- Leaderboard changes pushed to connected clients\n\n### Key Leaderboard Features:\n- **Sort Orders:** ASC or DESC\n- **Score Operators:** `set`, `best`, `incr`, `decr`\n- **Authoritative Mode:** Server-only score submission (anti-cheat)\n- **Reset Schedules:** CRON-based resets (daily, weekly, monthly)\n- **Metadata:** JSON data attached to scores\n- **Sub-scores:** For tie-breaking\n\n### Code Example:\n```typescript\nimport { Client, Session } from '@heroiclabs/nakama-js'\n\nconst client = new Client('defaultkey', 'localhost', '7350')\n\n// Submit score\nconst record = await client.writeLeaderboardRecord(\n  session,\n  'weekly_leaderboard',\n  { score: 1500, subscore: 10 }\n)\n\n// List top 100\nconst records = await client.listLeaderboardRecords(\n  session,\n  'weekly_leaderboard',\n  [],  // owner IDs\n  100  // limit\n)\n```\n\n### Pricing at Scale\n| Option | 10k Users | 100k Users |\n|--------|-----------|------------|\n| Self-hosted | $10-50/month (VPS) | $100-500/month |\n| Heroic Cloud | ~$600/month (production) | Custom pricing |\n\n### Pros\n- Purpose-built for games with leaderboards\n- PostgreSQL-compatible\n- Self-hosting available (Apache 2.0 license)\n- Anti-cheat with authoritative mode\n- Comprehensive game features (matchmaking, chat, etc.)\n\n### Cons\n- Overkill if you only need leaderboards\n- Self-hosting requires DevOps expertise\n- Managed hosting is expensive (~$600/month)\n\n**Sources:** [Nakama Leaderboards Docs](https://heroiclabs.com/docs/nakama/concepts/leaderboards/), [Heroic Labs Pricing](https://heroiclabs.com/pricing/), [Nakama GitHub](https://github.com/heroiclabs/nakama)\n\n---\n\n## 4. LootLocker\n\n**Best for:** Indie game developers wanting quick integration with cross-platform support\n\n### Integration with Existing PostgreSQL\n- **Low** - LootLocker is a fully managed BaaS (no self-hosting)\n- Would be a separate system from your PostgreSQL backend\n- Best suited as a dedicated leaderboard/progression service\n\n### Real-Time Capabilities\n- REST API-based (no native WebSocket real-time)\n- Would need to poll or implement your own WebSocket layer\n\n### Key Features:\n- Cross-platform leaderboards\n- Scheduled resets with rewards\n- Member IDs can be players, clans, or custom entities\n- Game API, Server API, and Admin API\n\n### Pricing at Scale\n| Users | Estimated Cost |\n|-------|----------------|\n| Up to 1k MAU | Free |\n| 10k MAU | Paid tier (contact for pricing) |\n| 100k MAU | Custom pricing |\n\n- Free up to 1,000 MAU\n- Paid tiers scale with success\n- Enterprise option with self-hosting available\n\n### Pros\n- Free tier for development and small games\n- Simple SDK integration\n- Cross-platform (Unity, Unreal, web, mobile)\n- No infrastructure management\n\n### Cons\n- No native real-time (requires polling)\n- Another external dependency\n- Limited documentation on exact pricing\n\n**Sources:** [LootLocker Blog](https://lootlocker.com/blog/selecting-the-right-backend-for-your-game), [LootLocker API Reference](https://ref.lootlocker.com/game-api/), [LootLocker Pricing](https://lootlocker.com/pricing)\n\n---\n\n## 5. NPM Packages (Redis-based)\n\n**Best for:** Teams wanting full control with existing Redis infrastructure\n\n### Top Packages:\n\n#### **redis-rank**\n- Promise-based with TypeScript definitions\n- Periodic leaderboards (daily, weekly, monthly)\n- Matrix leaderboards for multi-dimensional ranking\n- Requires Redis 2.6.12+\n\n#### **realtime-leaderboard**\n- Designed for 1M+ users\n- Multiple score update strategies\n- Works with `redis` or `ioredis` clients\n\n### Integration with Existing PostgreSQL\n- **Hybrid approach** - Use PostgreSQL for persistence, Redis for real-time ranking\n- Scores written to PostgreSQL, synced to Redis for fast ranking\n- Adds infrastructure complexity (need Redis)\n\n### Code Example (redis-rank):\n```typescript\nimport { Leaderboard } from 'redis-rank'\nimport Redis from 'ioredis'\n\nconst redis = new Redis()\nconst lb = new Leaderboard(redis, 'game:weekly', {\n  sortPolicy: 'high-to-low',\n  updatePolicy: 'best'\n})\n\n// Add/update score\nawait lb.update('user123', 1500)\n\n// Get rank\nconst rank = await lb.rank('user123')\n\n// Get top 10\nconst top10 = await lb.top(10)\n```\n\n### Pricing at Scale\n| Users | Redis Hosting Cost |\n|-------|-------------------|\n| 10k | $15-50/month (managed Redis) |\n| 100k | $50-200/month |\n\n- Railway offers Redis add-on\n- Upstash offers serverless Redis with free tier\n\n### Pros\n- Full control over implementation\n- Extremely fast O(log n) ranking with sorted sets\n- No vendor lock-in\n- Works with existing infrastructure\n\n### Cons\n- Requires Redis infrastructure\n- No built-in WebSocket layer (implement yourself)\n- More development effort\n\n**Sources:** [redis-rank npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redis-rank), [realtime-leaderboard npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/realtime-leaderboard)\n\n---\n\n## Comparison Matrix\n\n| Criteria | Supabase | Firebase | Nakama | LootLocker | Redis NPM |\n|----------|----------|----------|--------|------------|-----------|\n| **PostgreSQL Compatibility** | Native | None | High | None | Hybrid |\n| **Real-time Built-in** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No |\n| **Self-hosted Option** | Yes | No | Yes | Enterprise | Yes |\n| **Code Complexity** | Low | Low | Medium | Low | Medium |\n| **Cost @ 10k users** | $25-50 | $20-100 | $10-600 | Free-Paid | $15-50 |\n| **Cost @ 100k users** | $50-150 | $200-1000+ | $100-Custom | Custom | $50-200 |\n| **Gaming Features** | Basic | Basic | Extensive | Moderate | Basic |\n| **Railway Integration** | Medium | Low | High | Low | High |\n\n---\n\n## Recommendation\n\n### For Your Stack (Next.js 14 + FastAPI + PostgreSQL on Railway):\n\n**Primary Recommendation: Redis NPM Package (redis-rank) + Custom WebSocket**\n\n**Rationale:**\n1. **Works with your existing PostgreSQL** - Store authoritative scores in PostgreSQL, use Redis for fast ranking\n2. **Railway supports Redis** - Add Redis as a service alongside your PostgreSQL\n3. **Full control** - No external dependencies or vendor lock-in\n4. **Cost-effective** - Redis on Railway is ~$5-20/month at scale\n5. **Performance** - O(log n) operations for ranking millions of users\n\n**Implementation Architecture:**\n```\nUser Action -> FastAPI -> PostgreSQL (persist) -> Redis (rank)\n                              |\n                              v\n                    WebSocket Server -> Next.js Clients\n```\n\n**Alternative Recommendation: Supabase (if you want managed solution)**\n\nIf you prefer a managed solution and can tolerate running a second database:\n- Use Supabase specifically for real-time leaderboard features\n- Keep FastAPI/PostgreSQL on Railway for core business logic\n- Sync scores from your main DB to Supabase\n\n---\n\n### Quick Start Code (Redis + FastAPI + Next.js):\n\n**FastAPI (score submission):**\n```python\nfrom redis import Redis\nfrom sqlalchemy.orm import Session\n\nredis = Redis.from_url(REDIS_URL)\n\n@app.post(\"/scores\")\nasync def submit_score(user_id: str, score: int, db: Session):\n    # Persist to PostgreSQL\n    db_score = Score(user_id=user_id, score=score)\n    db.add(db_score)\n    db.commit()\n    \n    # Update Redis leaderboard\n    redis.zadd(\"leaderboard\", {user_id: score}, gt=True)\n    \n    # Broadcast via WebSocket (implement your WS server)\n    await broadcast_leaderboard_update()\n```\n\n**Next.js Client:**\n```typescript\n'use client'\nimport { useEffect, useState } from 'react'\n\nexport function Leaderboard() {\n  const [scores, setScores] = useState([])\n  \n  useEffect(() => {\n    // Initial fetch\n    fetch('/api/leaderboard').then(r => r.json()).then(setScores)\n    \n    // WebSocket for real-time updates\n    const ws = new WebSocket(WS_URL)\n    ws.onmessage = (e) => setScores(JSON.parse(e.data))\n    return () => ws.close()\n  }, [])\n  \n  return (\n    <ol>\n      {scores.map((s, i) => (\n        <li key={s.userId}>#{i+1} {s.userId}: {s.score}</li>\n      ))}\n    </ol>\n  )\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n| If you want... | Choose... |\n|----------------|-----------|\n| Best integration with existing stack | **Redis (redis-rank)** |\n| Managed real-time with PostgreSQL | **Supabase** |\n| Full game backend (matchmaking, chat, etc.) | **Nakama** |\n| Quickest setup, don't need real-time | **LootLocker** |\n| Maximum flexibility, unlimited scale | **Redis (self-managed)** |"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4204,"cache_read_input_tokens":23331,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4204,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWQacNjzrXhCsAjva15VN","type":"assistant","uuid":"f1ff4877-a8a4-43cb-9702-b749d837ca0a","timestamp":"2025-12-24T00:40:59.929Z"}
