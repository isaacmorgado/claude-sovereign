It has three different implementations of landmark detection based on three different papers. FacemarkKazemi is based on a paper titled \"One Millisecond Face Alignment with an Ensemble of Regression Trees\" by V.Kazemi and J. Sullivan published in CVPR 2014.(no content)FacemarkLBF is based on a paper titled \"Face alignment at 3000 fps via regressing local binary features\" by S. Ren published in CVPR 2014.\n\n## Accuracy and Performance Comparison\n\n### FacemarkLBF\nLBF is an algorithm for facial feature point detection based on local binary features. This algorithm first uses cascade regression to predict the rough locations of facial feature points, then uses local binary features to describe the appearance information of the face and uses this information to correct the locations of the feature points to get more accurate detection results. The main advantages of the LBF algorithm are high detection accuracy and relatively high computational efficiency. It can get better detection results in a variety of different situations, such as different lighting, expressions and postures.(no content)FacemarkLBF provides high accuracy in landmark detection, making it suitable for real-time applications. This method operates solely within the OpenCV framework, simplifying the setup process.\n\n### FacemarkKazemi Issues\nOne user reported: \"The results I get using the LBF facemark class and its pretrained model are far better in terms of speed and accuracy. This makes me nervous that I did something incorrectly when training the Kazemi model.\"(no content)With the pre-trained Kazemi model, users have reported that \"the landmarks always seem to be off or at a completely other place than what it should.\"(no content)For better Kazemi results, it's noted that \"if you are training with 194 landmarks, then results would be not as accurate as expected. You should try to train with 68 landmarks.\"\n\n### Model Availability\nEven though the Facemark API consists of three different implementations, a trained model is available for only FacemarkLBF. This makes FacemarkLBF more accessible for immediate use, while FacemarkKazemi requires users to train their own models.\n\n## Summary\n\nBased on the available information, **FacemarkLBF appears to be the more reliable and accurate option** for most users because:\n1. It has a pre-trained model readily available\n2. It offers better speed and accuracy in practical use\n3. The FacemarkKazemi implementation has reported issues with accuracy when using pre-trained models, and training custom models can be challenging\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e7fe439a-df10-49e7-ae7c-100143c93dd8","timestamp":"2025-12-20T01:42:10.081Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"OpenCV FacemarkLBF FacemarkKazemi facial landmark accuracy comparison","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01SCQNsNBHLRB2ykTDrZXDg4","content":[{"title":"Facemark : Facial Landmark Detection using OpenCV | LearnOpenCV #","url":"https://learnopencv.com/facemark-facial-landmark-detection-using-opencv/"},{"title":"Facemark : Facial Landmark Detection using OpenCV","url":"https://learnopencv.com/tag/facemarkkazemi/"},{"title":"GitHub - krshrimali/Facemark-In-OpenCV","url":"https://github.com/krshrimali/Facemark-In-OpenCV"},{"title":"Open-source Facial Landmark Detection | Restackio","url":"https://www.restack.io/p/open-source-face-recognition-system-answer-facial-landmark-detection-cat-ai"},{"title":"[GSoC '19] Python bindings for Facial Landmark API in OpenCV · GitHub","url":"https://gist.github.com/saiteja-talluri/1d0e4fc4c75774b936b99c7c52b65fe6"},{"title":"Facemark Kazemi Training - OpenCV Q&A Forum","url":"https://answers.opencv.org/question/182433/facemark-kazemi-training/"},{"title":"Using the Facemark API Python [closed] - OpenCV Q&A Forum","url":"https://answers.opencv.org/question/206275/using-the-facemark-api-python/"},{"title":"Facial Landmark Detection with OpenCV & UNIHIKER - DFRobot Maker Community","url":"https://community.dfrobot.com/makelog-314246.html"},{"title":"Kazemi-based facemark detection pre-trained model does not produce valid fitting results · Issue #1683 · opencv/opencv_contrib","url":"https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/issues/1683"},{"title":"Face Landmark Detection Opencv | Restackio","url":"https://www.restack.io/p/open-source-face-recognition-system-answer-face-landmark-detection-opencv-cat-ai"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about the comparison between OpenCV's FacemarkLBF and FacemarkKazemi facial landmark detection algorithms:\n\n## OpenCV Facemark Algorithms Overview\n\nOpenCV's facial landmark API is called Facemark.

It introduces a Diffused Two-Stream Network for heatmap regression, which effectively captures both local and global geometric features by integrating pointwise scalar flow, tangent space vector flow, and spectral features in the Laplace-Beltrami space.(no content)The method achieves state-of-the-art results on both a 3D cranial dataset and the BU-3DFE facial dataset.\n\n4. **Unsupervised Joint Learning Framework** (2025)\n   Deep learning approaches have advanced state-of-the-art performance drastically in facial landmark detection and head pose estimation. Recent work shows that meaningful landmarks could be discovered from unlabeled image collections.(no content)A novel framework jointly learns both tasks with a multi-task network for joint landmark and pose prediction, a set of learnable 3D canonical landmarks, and an image generation network learned collaboratively on unlabeled face images.\n\n5. **Multi-Expert Collaborative Uncertainty-Aware Networks** (2025)\n   Heatmap regression-based methods have become a dominant approach in facial landmark detection, demonstrating impressive performance. This approach focuses on interpretable facial landmark detection through collaborative uncertainty-aware deep networks.\n\n6. **Attention-Based Deep Learning for 3D Craniofacial Landmarks** (2025)\n   This work developed an innovative two-stage attention-based deep learning framework for robust landmark detection and diagnostic classification, addressing complex anatomy and significant biological variability.\n\n### Models for Occluded Faces (2024)\nFor facial landmark localization over heavily occluded face images, comparative analysis shows that face.evoLVE has the highest accuracy, but the general object detection model YOLOv5 is recommended due to its potential for optimization in terms of accuracy.\n\n### Multi-Domain Detection with Synthetic Data (2024)\nA method using Stable Diffusion achieved state-of-the-art results on the ArtFace dataset by leveraging synthetic data generation for multi-domain face landmark detection.\n\n### Key Techniques Used:\n- Transformer architectures (ORFormer, Point Transformer v3)\n- Heatmap regression methods\n- Multi-modal fusion with attention mechanisms\n- Unsupervised/self-supervised learning approaches\n- Graph convolutional networks\n- Wing loss and Adaptive Wing Loss for robust training"],"durationSeconds":28.336927207999977}}

As a landmark coordinate prediction, heatmap-based methods are known to achieve a high accuracy, and Lite-HRNet can achieve a fast estimation. However, with Lite-HRNet, the problem of a heavy computational cost of the fusion block, which connects feature maps with different resolutions, has yet to be solved.(no content)Given these problems, the authors propose a novel architecture called Lite-HRNet Plus. Lite-HRNet Plus achieves two improvements: a novel fusion block based on a channel attention and a novel output module with less computational intensity using multi-resolution feature maps.\n\n## Evaluation Metrics and Benchmarks\n\nAs an evaluation metric, they applied the normalized mean error (NME), which uses the distance between the outer corners of the eyes as the reference distance to normalize the absolute errors.\n\n### Datasets Used:\n- The WFLW dataset consists of 7,500 face images for training and 2,500 face images for testing. It is annotated with 98 landmarks(no content)and provides rich attribute labels such as large poses, expressions, illumination, make-up, occlusions, and blur.\n\n- The 300W dataset is a widely adopted dataset for facial alignment with 3,148 images for training, 689 images for validation, and 600 images for testing. It is manually annotated with 68 landmarks, and the validation data are divided into two sub-categories: 554 images for the common subset and 135 images for the challenging subset.\n\n## Performance Results\n\nLite-HRNet Plus performed better despite having the lowest computational complexity.(no content)Comparing Lite-HRNet Plus with the BCE loss at 10.25M FLOPs to PIPNet at 11.46M FLOPs, the NME was improved by over 1.35% in the WFLW dataset and the NME for test set was improved by 0.19% in the 300W dataset.(no content)These results demonstrate that Lite-HRNet Plus is superior to conventional lightweight methods. The paper shows a graphical comparison of the existing methods in terms of the speed and accuracy trade-off on the WFLW and 300W datasets.(no content)After verification using various lightweight methods, the authors confirmed that Lite-HRNet Plus achieved the best FLOPs-NME tradeoff.\n\n**Note:** The search results did not return specific NME values for AFLW benchmark. The paper primarily reports results on WFLW and 300W datasets. For the exact numerical NME values across all benchmarks, you may need to refer to the full paper available at arXiv (paper ID: 2308.12133).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5c28daed-931c-4675-afcf-3a8299013043","timestamp":"2025-12-20T01:43:07.503Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"Lite-HRNet Plus\" facial landmark accuracy AFLW WFLW 300W benchmark NME","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01J8tTmLXWzszfRuqn9JL9xc","content":[{"title":"[2308.12133] LITE-HRNET PLUS: FAST AND ACCURATE FACIAL LANDMARK DETECTION","url":"https://ar5iv.labs.arxiv.org/html/2308.12133"},{"title":"Lite-HRNet Plus: Fast and Accurate Facial Landmark Detection – arXiv Vanity","url":"http://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/2308.12133/"},{"title":"GitHub - HRNet/HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection: This is an official implementation of facial landmark detection for our TPAMI paper \"Deep High-Resolution Representation Learning for Visual Recognition\". https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.07919","url":"https://github.com/HRNet/HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection"},{"title":"Lite-HRNet Plus: Fast and Accurate Facial Landmark Detection | Request PDF","url":"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/373332871_Lite-HRNet_Plus_Fast_and_Accurate_Facial_Landmark_Detection"},{"title":"GitHub - jacke121/HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection: High-resolution representation learning (HRNets) for facial landmark detection","url":"https://github.com/jacke121/HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection"},{"title":"HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection/README.md at master · HRNet/HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection","url":"https://github.com/HRNet/HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection/blob/master/README.md"},{"title":"GitHub - yinguobing/facial-landmark-detection-hrnet: A TensorFlow implementation of HRNet for facial landmark detection.","url":"https://github.com/yinguobing/facial-landmark-detection-hrnet"},{"title":"HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection/lib/datasets/wflw.py at master · HRNet/HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection","url":"https://github.com/HRNet/HRNet-Facial-Landmark-Detection/blob/master/lib/datasets/wflw.py"},{"title":"GitHub - huuhieu2905/HRNet: Facial Landmark Detection with Deep High Resolution Net","url":"https://github.com/huuhieu2905/HRNet"},{"title":"Fast Facial Landmark Detection and Applications: A Survey Kostiantyn Khabarlak","url":"https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.10808"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about **Lite-HRNet Plus** and its facial landmark detection accuracy on benchmark datasets:\n\n## Lite-HRNet Plus Overview\n\nFacial landmark detection is an essential technology for driver status tracking and has been in demand for real-time estimations.
