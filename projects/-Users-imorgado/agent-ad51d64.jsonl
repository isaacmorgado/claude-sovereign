You can interpret it as your business makes 3x of what it costs to acquire a customer, or for every $1 spent on acquisition, you get $3 back.(no content)To scale your SaaS business, LTV/CAC ratio should be greater than 3.

You can interpret it as your business makes 3x of what it costs to acquire a customer, or for every $1 spent on acquisition, you get $3 back.(no content)To scale your SaaS business, LTV/CAC ratio should be greater than 3. If it's lower, continue working on your product market fit. If it's too high, above 5, invest more in marketing and sales.

It's crucial to evaluate the impact of discounts on customer acquisition costs and long-term value to ensure sustainable growth.\n\n## SaaS Referral Program Strategies\n\nA SaaS referral program is a structured initiative that encourages customers to recommend your software to others in exchange for rewards. These programs build on the trust between your customers and their networks, making referrals an effective channel for user acquisition.\n\n### Why Referrals Work:\n- 86 percent of consumers consider recommendations critical to their decision-making process, particularly for software purchases.\n- 39 percent of customers report their loyalty increases after making a referral.\n- Referral programs cost less than paid ads, while bringing in high-value users.\n\n### Effective Incentive Structures:\nSome of the most common incentives are discounts, a free month of subscription, an extension on the free trial, unlocking premium features or upgrades.(no content)You will also have to decide whether to offer a one-sided reward structure (incentive to the referrer) or a two-sided reward structure (incentive to the referrer and the referred person).\n\n**Example:** RealtyNinja's \"Give 10 percent off, Get 10 percent off\" program: When an existing customer refers a friend, the friend gets 10 percent off their first subscription, and the referrer also receives 10 percent off their next billing cycle.(no content)Non-cash incentives are 24% more effective than cash incentives at boosting referral performance.\n\n### Best Practices:\n- The best programs integrate into the user experience with in-app sharing, referral dashboards, and simple tracking.\n- Programs that reward more than just sign-ups (such as engagement milestones or upgrades) encourage deeper customer participation.\n- As referral programs are a pay-for-performance marketing strategy, you only have to reward referrers when someone signs up for your free trial or monthly subscription. You can lower your CAC by offering incentives that are at no cost to you, like free content, limited-time upgrades, or a free month of service.\n\n## Video Marketing for SaaS\n\n91% of businesses are using video marketing in 2023, and 91% of marketers are satisfied with the ROI of video marketing on social media.(no content)Animation is especially useful in SaaS video production because it allows you to visually simplify complex software features.

This acquisition channel can be incredibly powerful and it comes with little-to-no barriers to entry.\n- Offering discounts or credits as referral rewards is an effective way for SaaS companies to increase customer lifetime value."],"durationSeconds":22.49753624999896}}

Codes also give consumers an additional reason to visit your eCommerce property and make purchases.(no content)On average, brands can expect significantly more UGC from their ambassador and affiliate programs after implementing codes because they provide the creator with a strong CTA.\n\n### Tiered Reward Systems\nIncentive options include discounts, bundles, VIP access, and feature on brand page, with a recommended timeline of T-30 (seeding) → Launch week → T+60 (winners & case studies).(no content)A regional D2C beauty brand launched a \"30-Day Transformation\" challenge with micro-creators seeding the trend and a simple reward ladder (bundles, VIP previews, brand features), generating over twelve thousand submissions in six weeks and a 38% conversion uplift.\n\n### Non-Monetary Incentives\nShout-outs on social media, featuring creators on your website, or providing early access to new products can go a long way in fostering loyalty and better content.(no content)Whether it's as simple as reposting on the brand's social channels or offering products/tickets, having a clear incentive from the start has consistently generated higher participation and better results for campaigns across a variety of industries.\n\n### Gamification\nGamify!

Airtable provides a $10 account credit for each referral, and DigitalOcean offers a $200 credit for new users to explore their services for 60 days.(no content)Notion's approach: When your friend or colleague signs up via your referral link, you earn $5 credit and the referral receives $10 credit for any paid Notion plans.\n\n**Advantages:**\n- Credits to use towards future purchases are \"a great way to build customer loyalty through increased engagement. Since discounts are applied toward future purchases, they help build long-term relationships.\" Offering discounts or credits as referral rewards is an effective way for SaaS companies to increase customer lifetime value.\n- You may not want to give away a percentage discount because that could expose you to potentially quite a bit of loss. For those types of applications, credits are recommended. The credit should average around 10-20% of a user's first month, giving them enough incentive to try it without breaking the bank.\n- Given that the number one goal for brands running referral programs is to maximize new customer acquisition, account credit and bonus loyalty points—where possible—are often the way to go.\n\n### Percentage Discounts\n\n**How they work:**\nThe referrer gets a percentage discount on their next bill or a free month of service, and the new user receives the same.(no content)RealtyNinja uses a \"Give 10 percent off, Get 10 percent off\" approach. When an existing customer refers a friend, the friend gets 10 percent off their first subscription, and the referrer also receives 10 percent off their next billing cycle.\n\n**Considerations:**\nWhich is the better variant to offer—cash savings against a referrer's next purchase or a percentage discount? That depends not on how often customers shop with you, but on how much they tend to spend, your variety of products, and many other factors.\n\n### The \"Rule of 100\"\nThere's a theory in referral marketing that everything boils down to the Rule of 100: if your average customer spends over $100, then it's better to offer set cash amounts off their next spend. However, if the average spend is less than $100, then percentages are more effective. The psychology: $50 off $500 does feel meatier than 10% off.(no content)Tesla's friend offer is a great example: you get $1000 off the price of a new car! A thousand dollars seems like a lot, but not when you consider it's only a 1.4% discount for their $70,000 car.\n\n### B2B vs B2C Considerations\n\nFor B2C, focus on personal incentives, immediate gratification, and a simple, frictionless sharing process. Make the reward something your user would be excited to get for themselves—think cash, credits, and free months.(no content)Swag works really well for B2B companies where users aren't actually paying the bill, whereas discount and credit works better for small business and consumer apps where the person paying the bill is also a user of the app.\n\n### Alternative Approaches\n\nCompanies can incentivize referrals by offering upgraded account status. For example, Trello rewards referrers with one month of their \"Premium\" level service for each signup, up to 12 months. This gives users access to a new service level with a variety of new features and member benefits.(no content)Dropbox's referral program became the blueprint in SaaS by offering dual-sided incentives—rewarding both the referrer and the referee with extra storage space. Basic users earn 500 MB per referral, while Plus users gain 1 GB. This straightforward system encourages users to share widely, creating viral loops. The program's success lies in its simplicity and alignment with user needs.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"80aec1ec-7076-4089-b865-227401e2783c","timestamp":"2025-12-20T03:11:26.845Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"credit-based referral bonuses vs percentage discounts SaaS comparison","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01K4y8FhKhAH8rTiKPwuL2HM","content":[{"title":"How To Choose Right Referral Incentives (20+ Examples)","url":"https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/referral-program-incentives"},{"title":"Building Viral Growth: Leveraging Incentives in SaaS Referral Programs & Strategies","url":"https://thegood.com/insights/saas-referral-program/"},{"title":"Best SaaS Referral Programs: tips, features and B2B examples [2025]","url":"https://elfsight.com/affiliate-program/article-saas-referral-program/"},{"title":"How to Structure Rewards for a B2C vs. B2B SaaS Referral Program | Viral Loops Insider","url":"https://viral-loops.com/blog/saas-referral-program-2/"},{"title":"Referral Rewards & Incentives: The Ultimate Guide","url":"https://www.buyapowa.com/blog/referral-rewards-and-incentives/"},{"title":"10 examples of great referral programs to inspire you","url":"https://www.customermarketingalliance.com/great-referral-programs/"},{"title":"How to launch a referral program to grow your SaaS application – a detailed guide based on Avoma’s journey","url":"https://www.avoma.com/blog/how-to-launch-a-saas-referral-program"},{"title":"Why Every SaaS Needs a Referral Program (with Examples)","url":"https://growsurf.com/blog/saas-referral-program-why"},{"title":"Video: What reward should I offer for a referral?","url":"https://www.saasquatch.com/blog/what-reward-should-i-offer-for-a-referral/"},{"title":"How to Create a High-Converting SaaS Referral Program","url":"https://impact.com/referral/saas-referral-program-guide/"}]},"Based on my search, here's a comparison of credit-based referral bonuses vs. percentage discounts for SaaS companies:\n\n## Credit-Based Referral Bonuses vs. Percentage Discounts in SaaS\n\n### Credit-Based Referral Bonuses\n\n**How they work:**\nWhile some don't recommend cash rewards or discounts, credits can be a valuable way to drive referrals.

According to the 2025 Monetization Monitor, 59% of software companies expect usage-based approaches to grow as a percentage of revenue this year, an 18% increase from 2023.(no content)The 2023 State of Usage-Based Pricing Report from OpenView Advisors showed that 61% of SaaS companies use some form of UBP (i.e., a hybrid pricing strategy or pure UBP), with a further 21% expected to test a UBP model in 2023 or later.\n\n### Key Benefits\nUsage-based pricing ensures that customers pay in direct proportion to the value they receive from your product. This alignment fosters a sense of fairness, enhancing customer satisfaction and loyalty. By catering to both small and large businesses, usage-based pricing broadens your market reach.(no content)The main advantage of pay-as-you-go pricing is that it provides customers with greater control over their expenses. However, the drawback is that it may lead to unpredictable revenue for the SaaS company.\n\n## Referral Discount Strategy\n\nDiscounts can help lower customer acquisition costs (CAC) by attracting price-sensitive customers, increasing conversion rates, or even incentivizing referrals.(no content)Companies like Dropbox grew so rapidly because of user referrals, as their existing users passed on the product to friends and colleagues.(no content)Discounts can be tied to future referrals, leveraging satisfied clients to bolster your client base and streamline sales efforts. Volume discounts, when tailored to offer genuine value, can be a potent tool for nurturing client relationships and sustaining growth.\n\n## Profitability Considerations\n\n### The Discounting Dilemma\nData shows that discounting can reduce customer lifetime value (LTV) by over 30%. Discounted customers are significantly more likely to churn. They've been told your product isn't worth the sticker price, or weren't even the right customers in the first place.(no content)SaaS businesses using this model have to strike the right balance. If you discount too far or don't create limits, then heavy users may create profitability issues.\n\n### Balancing Price and Profit\nPrice too low and you win more deals but risk losing out on profitability.

Now I have comprehensive research. Let me compile this into a detailed analysis for you.\n\n## Comprehensive Referral Program Research for Your Premiere Pro Plugin\n\nBased on current market research and real-world SaaS examples, here's what you need to know about structuring a profitable referral program for your video processing plugin:\n\n---\n\n## 1. IS 50% OFF FIRST MONTH A GOOD REFERRAL INCENTIVE?\n\n**Short Answer: NO - this is too aggressive for most SaaS, especially with variable costs.**\n\n### Industry Benchmarks vs. 50% Discount\n\n**Typical referral discounts range:**\n- **5-25% off** for percentage-based discounts (most common)\n- **$10-$20 fixed credits** for credit-based rewards (increasingly popular)\n- **Free month** (roughly 8-15% value) - used by companies like Trello\n- **10% mutual benefit** (referrer gets 10% off, referee gets 10% off) - RealtyNinja's model\n\n**Real-world examples:**\n- **Descript**: 30% of first customer payment, capped at $20 total per referral\n- **Kapwing**: 25% recurring commission (affiliate model, not user referral)\n- **Synthesia**: 20-25% per sale with tiered bonuses\n\nA **50% first-month discount is problematic** because:\n1. It dramatically reduces your LTV without proportional CAC savings\n2. It signals weakness in your pricing/product value\n3. Customers expect discount pricing in the future\n4. With variable API costs (your $0.02-0.03/min), this cuts into profitability severely\n\n---\n\n## 2. HOW TO STRUCTURE REFERRAL DISCOUNTS FOR PROFITABILITY\n\n### The Core Formula: Ensure LTV/CAC Ratio Stays Healthy\n\n**Industry Standard:**\n- **Ideal LTV:CAC ratio = 3:1 or higher**\n- For SaaS companies at $1-5M ARR: 3.4-4.2:1 is median\n- If ratio drops below 3:1, you're unsustainable\n- If above 5:1, you should invest more in growth\n\n**With variable API costs, you need even tighter margins.** Here's a concrete example:\n\n**Your Cost Model:**\n- API costs: $0.02-0.03/minute of processed video\n- Average user processing: ~50 hours/month of video = 3,000 minutes\n- Your API cost per user: ~$60-90/month\n\n**Example Tier-Based Structure (Recommended):**\n\n| Plan | Monthly Price | Typical API Cost | Margin | Referral Incentive | Impact on Unit Economics |\n|------|--------------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|-------------------------|\n| Free | $0 | $0-20 | N/A | N/A | N/A |\n| Starter | $29 | $60-90 | -110% to -210% | Not profitable alone | Skip, focus on growth |\n| Pro | $99 | $60-90 | +9-39% | $10 credit or 10% off | Works at scale |\n| Team | $399 | $60-90 (×N users) | +80%+ | 10% off or $30 credit | Highly profitable |\n\n**Key insight:** Your referral incentive should only be offered on profitable tiers (Pro and above).\n\n---\n\n## 3. CAC (CUSTOMER ACQUISITION COST) CONSIDERATIONS\n\n### Referral Programs' Advantage Over Paid Marketing\n\nAccording to Wharton Business School research:\n- **Referred customers cost $23.12 LESS to acquire** than non-referred\n- Average SaaS CAC: **$702**\n- Your referral incentive should be < $100 to maintain healthy economics\n\n**For your plugin:**\n- If you're currently spending $500-1,000 in ads per customer\n- A $10-20 referral incentive = **50-100x ROI** on marketing spend\n- Even a $30 incentive keeps CAC under $100 if you get 3-4 referrals per referrer\n\n**Best Practice:** Keep referral incentive between 10-20% of first-month revenue, not exceeding $50.\n\n### Why Referrals Beat Paid Ads for Your Use Case\n- UGC creators actively use your product and create social proof\n- They have built-in audiences (their social followers)\n- Their endorsement is 86% more likely to influence purchasing decisions\n- Cost is only incurred on successful conversions (pay-for-performance)\n\n---\n\n## 4. LTV (LIFETIME VALUE) REQUIREMENTS FOR REFERRALS TO WORK\n\n### Critical Threshold: You Need Strong Unit Economics First\n\n**If your Starter plan ($29) has negative unit economics, referrals won't save you.**\n\nFor a sustainable referral program, you need:\n- **LTV ≥ $2,100** (to maintain 3:1 LTV:CAC with reasonable CAC)\n- **Retention rate ≥ 40% annually** (or your LTV is too low)\n- **Expansion revenue** (users upgrading to Pro/Team plans)\n\n**Example LTV Calculation for Your Pro Plan ($99/mo):**\n- Monthly revenue: $99\n- Gross margin: ~60% (accounting for API costs) = $59\n- Average customer lifetime: 12 months (industry average for SMB SaaS)\n- **LTV = $59 × 12 = $708**\n\nWith this LTV:\n- CAC cap for 3:1 ratio = $708 ÷ 3 = **$236**\n- Referral incentive should be < $40 to leave room for other marketing\n\n**Referred customers are 27% more likely to stay**, which improves your LTV calculation significantly.\n\n---\n\n## 5. REAL-WORLD EXAMPLES FROM VIDEO EDITING TOOLS\n\n### Descript (Closest Competitor)\n\n**Program Structure:**\n- **Referral program** (for paid users): Earn 30% of friend's first payment, **capped at $20**\n- **Affiliate program** (for influencers): $25 flat per conversion\n- Users can only earn up to $20 per referral\n- Only paid users can participate\n- Friend must be brand-new account\n\n**Why this works:** \n- The $20 cap is intentional - prevents race to the bottom\n- Forces focus on quality over quantity\n- 30% of typical first payment = reasonable incentive\n\n### Kapwing (Affiliate Model)\n\n**Program Structure:**\n- **25% recurring commission** on Pro subscription sales\n- Free Pro account for top affiliates\n- Early access to new tools\n- Community of creator partners\n\n**Why this differs:** \n- Affiliate model (creators as partners, not user referrals)\n- Recurring commission aligns long-term interests\n- Targets content creators specifically\n\n### Synthesia (API-Based Video)\n\n**Program Structure:**\n- **20-25% commission per annual plan** (or per month)\n- Tiered bonuses: Free yearly account after 10 sales, custom avatar after 15 sales\n- 60-day cookie window\n- PayPal payouts only after hitting $30\n\n**Key Learning:** API-based video tools use higher commission rates (20-25%) because:\n- They can absorb the cost due to high margins\n- Customers typically have longer contracts\n- Expansion revenue offsets referral costs\n\n---\n\n## 6. UGC CREATOR-SPECIFIC REFERRAL STRATEGIES\n\n### Why UGC Creators Are Your Best Referral Channel\n\n**Strengths:**\n- They already produce video content and understand your use case\n- They have built-in audiences (TikTok, Instagram, YouTube)\n- Their endorsement = authentic, peer-to-peer recommendation\n- High conversion rate (26%+ better than cold marketing)\n\n### Recommended Structure for UGC Creators\n\n**Tiered Incentive Model:**\n\n```\nTier 1 (Friend referral):\n- Referrer gets: $10-15 account credit or 10% off\n- Referee gets: 10% off first month OR $10 credit\n- Goal: Drive new signups\n\nTier 2 (Content partnership):\n- Creators who post about plugin: Free Pro account + API credits\n- Paid in: Product, not cash (aligns incentives)\n- Expected: 2-4 pieces of authentic UGC content\n\nTier 3 (Affiliate program):\n- Top creators: 15-20% commission on annual plans\n- Prerequisite: 50+ monthly active subscribers on social\n- Tools: Custom tracking links, affiliate dashboard\n```\n\n### Implementation Tips for Creators\n1. **Make referral shareable** - One-click TikTok/Instagram share buttons\n2. **Track referral code attribution** in-app (show dashboard)\n3. **Gamify milestones** - \"Unlock achievements\" at 5, 10, 25 referrals\n4. **Non-cash perks work 25% better** than cash for this audience\n5. **Early feature access** is highly valued (beta tools, premium filters)\n\n**Budget allocation:** Allocate 10-15% of marketing budget to creator partnerships and seeding (gifts + incentives).\n\n---\n\n## 7. CREDIT-BASED BONUSES VS. PERCENTAGE DISCOUNTS\n\n### Head-to-Head Comparison\n\n| Dimension | Credit-Based | Percentage Discount |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **Consumer Psychology** | Feels like a gift/bonus | Feels like saving money |\n| **Profitability Impact** | Lower (credits often unused) | Higher (direct margin hit) |\n| **Churn Effect** | Lower churn | Can increase churn 30%+ |\n| **Brand Perception** | Builds goodwill | Can undermine brand value |\n| **Best When Spend is...** | Any amount | >$100/month |\n| **For Referrals** | Recommended | Not recommended |\n\n### Why Credit-Based Works Better for Your Plugin\n\n**For your use case, credits are superior because:**\n\n1. **Psychological advantage:** $20 in credits feels more valuable than 15% off\n2. **Less churn:** Credits tied to future usage = more engagement with platform\n3. **Higher profitability:** Not all credits are used (typical redemption 70-80%)\n4. **Stickiness:** Customers keep account open to use credits\n\n**Real-world examples using credits:**\n- **Airtable**: $10 credit per referral\n- **DigitalOcean**: $200 credit to explore\n- **Notion**: $5 to referrer, $10 to referee\n\n### Recommended Credit Structure for Your Plugin\n\n```\nReferrer receives: $15 API processing credit\n- Value to customer: Can process ~500-750 minutes of video free\n- Cost to you: ~$7.50-10 (50% margin on variable cost)\n- Better than: 20% discount on $29 plan ($5.80)\n\nReferee receives: $20 API processing credit + 14-day trial extension\n- Value to referee: Higher perceived value\n- Cost to you: ~$10 (50% margin)\n- Converts faster than just discount\n```\n\n**Why this works:**\n- Low marginal cost (API credits use existing capacity)\n- High perceived value\n- Drives product engagement (users process more video = more value realized)\n- Doesn't train customers to expect permanent discounts\n\n---\n\n## SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR YOUR PREMIERE PRO PLUGIN\n\n### Recommended Referral Program Structure\n\n**Program Name Ideas:**\n- \"Refer & Create\" \n- \"Creator Rewards\"\n- \"Share the Edit\"\n\n**Structure:**\n\n```\nBASE PROGRAM (All Users):\n├─ Referrer receives: $15 API credit\n├─ Referee receives: $20 API credit + 7-day trial extension\n├─ Viral cap: No limit (encourage sharing)\n└─ Mechanics: In-app referral link, social share buttons\n\nCREATOR TIER (50+ social followers):\n├─ Referral commission: 15% of first year\n├─ Bonus: Free Pro account (if 10+ referrals/month)\n├─ Content: 2-3 UGC videos annually\n└─ Dashboard: Real-time referral tracking\n\nPAYMENT OPTIONS:\n├─ Credits first (for engagement)\n├─ Cash payout: $25 minimum, quarterly\n├─ Swag: Limited edition merchandise for top performers\n└─ Early access to new features\n```\n\n### Expected Unit Economics\n\n**Scenario:** 1,000 active users, 10% referral rate = 100 referrals/month\n\n```\nReferral cost per conversion:\n- Referrer credit: $7.50 (cost to you)\n- Referee credit: $10 (cost to you)\n- Total: $17.50 per referral\n\nReferred customer (12-month LTV):\n- Monthly plan: $99 Pro (assumed)\n- Gross margin: 60% = $59.40/month\n- Annual value: $712.80\n- LTV after referral cost: $695.30\n\nComparison to paid ads:\n- Typical CAC: $500\n- Referral \"CAC\": $17.50\n- 28x better efficiency\n```\n\n### Launch Checklist\n\n- [ ] Cap referral credits at $50/month per user (prevents gaming)\n- [ ] Require 30-day account age before earning credits (stop churners)\n- [ ] Track referral source in analytics (measure performance)\n- [ ] Send monthly referral dashboard emails (encourage sharing)\n- [ ] Highlight top referrers (social proof, gamification)\n- [ ] Test 2-3 messaging variants on onboarding\n- [ ] Measure: referral rate, conversion rate, LTV vs. non-referred\n\n---\n\n## CRITICAL FINANCIAL SAFEGUARDS\n\n**Before launching, ensure:**\n\n1. **Breakeven analysis**: Calculate at what plan tier your margins stay positive\n   - Starter ($29): Likely negative with API costs - don't offer referrals\n   - Pro ($99+): Positive margin - offer referrals here\n   \n2. **Fraud prevention**: Cap credits, require email verification, prevent self-referrals\n\n3. **Cohort analysis**: Track whether referred users actually have better LTV than non-referred\n\n4. **Profit protection**: Set monthly budget cap (e.g., max $5,000/month in referral incentives)\n\n5. **Payback period**: Ensure referral CAC is recovered within 3-4 months\n\n---\n\n## SOURCES\n\n- [Building Viral Growth: Leveraging Incentives in SaaS Referral Programs & Strategies](https://thegood.com/insights/saas-referral-program/)\n- [Best SaaS Referral Programs: tips, features and B2B examples [2025]](https://elfsight.com/affiliate-program/article-saas-referral-program/)\n- [Master SaaS Referral Programs: A Complete Guide | MADX](https://www.madx.digital/learn/saas-referral-program)\n- [The 4 Referral Program Categories for B2B SaaS (2025 Guide + Examples) | Cello](https://cello.so/4-categories-of-referral-programs-for-b2b-saas/)\n- [How to Build a Referral Program in 2025 (+80 Examples)](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/47-referral-programs)\n- [13 Best SaaS Referral Program Strategies & Optimisations (2025)](https://www.dansiepen.io/growth-checklists/saas-referral-program-strategies-optimisations)\n- [Descript Referral Program](https://help.descript.com/hc/en-us/articles/40556901728013-Refer-others-and-earn-rewards)\n- [Kapwing Affiliate Program](https://www.kapwing.com)\n- [LTV:CAC Ratio: What It Is & How To Calculate It | Klipfolio](https://www.klipfolio.com/resources/kpi-examples/saas/customer-lifetime-value-to-customer-acquisition-cost)\n- [What is a Good LTV to CAC Ratio?](https://blog.hubspot.com/service/ltv-cac-ratio)\n- [How To Choose Right Referral Incentives (20+ Examples)](https://www.referralcandy.com/blog/referral-program-incentives)\n- [How to Structure Rewards for a B2C vs. B2B SaaS Referral Program | Viral Loops Insider](https://viral-loops.com/blog/saas-referral-program-2/)\n- [Usage-Based Pricing for SaaS and AI: Your Complete Guide](https://www.revenera.com/blog/software-monetization/usage-based-pricing-saas-ai/)\n- [Synthesia Affiliate Program -
