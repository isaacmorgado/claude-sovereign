Roo Code handles two primary types of settings: Global Settings (user preferences that apply to the entire extension) and Provider Settings (API configurations for different language model providers including keys, models, and endpoints).\n\n## Custom Endpoint Configuration\n\n### Using Auto-Import Settings Path\n\nYou can configure custom settings by using the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and searching for \"Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)\", then adding the `roo-cline.autoImportSettingsPath` key with the path to your configuration file.(no content)When VS Code starts, Roo Code checks for the `roo-cline.autoImportSettingsPath` setting. If this setting contains a path to a valid Roo Code configuration file (.json), Roo Code will load it automatically.\n\n### OpenAI-Compatible Custom Endpoints\n\nIf you prefer full control and don't want to rely on third-party services, you can host your own models using vLLM. vLLM allows you to expose open-source models behind an OpenAI-compatible API, which RooCode accepts out of the box.(no content)After deploying vLLM, you can configure RooCode using a settings file such as `roo-code-settings.json` that points RooCode to your LLM endpoint as OpenAI compatible using the `providerProfiles` configuration.\n\n### Kubernetes/ConfigMap Example\n\nFor cloud deployments, you can use a ConfigMap like:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: code-server-settings\ndata:\n  settings.json: |\n    {\n      \"workbench.colorTheme\": \"Default Dark Modern\",\n      \"roo-cline.autoImportSettingsPath\": \"~/roo-code-settings.json\"\n    }\n```\n\n### Codebase Indexing Custom Endpoints\n\nFor code indexing specifically, there are configuration options under the \"Code Indexing\" section including the Base URL (`roo-cline.codebaseIndexEmbedderBaseUrl`) - a text input field that allows specifying a custom API endpoint URL.(no content)For OpenAI embeddings, users can point to a proxy, an Azure OpenAI endpoint, or other OpenAI API-compatible endpoints.

Roo Code handles two primary types of settings: Global Settings (user preferences that apply to the entire extension) and Provider Settings (API configurations for different language model providers including keys, models, and endpoints).\n\n## Custom Endpoint Configuration\n\n### Using Auto-Import Settings Path\n\nYou can configure custom settings by using the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) and searching for \"Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)\", then adding the `roo-cline.autoImportSettingsPath` key with the path to your configuration file.(no content)When VS Code starts, Roo Code checks for the `roo-cline.autoImportSettingsPath` setting. If this setting contains a path to a valid Roo Code configuration file (.json), Roo Code will load it automatically.\n\n### OpenAI-Compatible Custom Endpoints\n\nIf you prefer full control and don't want to rely on third-party services, you can host your own models using vLLM. vLLM allows you to expose open-source models behind an OpenAI-compatible API, which RooCode accepts out of the box.(no content)After deploying vLLM, you can configure RooCode using a settings file such as `roo-code-settings.json` that points RooCode to your LLM endpoint as OpenAI compatible using the `providerProfiles` configuration.\n\n### Kubernetes/ConfigMap Example\n\nFor cloud deployments, you can use a ConfigMap like:\n```yaml\napiVersion: v1\nkind: ConfigMap\nmetadata:\n  name: code-server-settings\ndata:\n  settings.json: |\n    {\n      \"workbench.colorTheme\": \"Default Dark Modern\",\n      \"roo-cline.autoImportSettingsPath\": \"~/roo-code-settings.json\"\n    }\n```\n\n### Codebase Indexing Custom Endpoints\n\nFor code indexing specifically, there are configuration options under the \"Code Indexing\" section including the Base URL (`roo-cline.codebaseIndexEmbedderBaseUrl`) - a text input field that allows specifying a custom API endpoint URL.(no content)For OpenAI embeddings, users can point to a proxy, an Azure OpenAI endpoint, or other OpenAI API-compatible endpoints. There's also a Model ID setting (`roo-cline.codebaseIndexEmbedderModelId`) that allows specifying any model ID compatible with the chosen provider and endpoint.\n\n## Export/Import Settings\n\nClicking the Export button saves your current Roo Code settings to a JSON file. The exported file includes your configured API Provider Profiles and Global Settings (UI preferences, mode configurations, context settings, etc.).(no content)Security Warning: The exported JSON file contains all your configured API Provider Profiles and Global Settings, including API keys in plaintext.

Powered by vLLM.\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/dfaisalmahmood/dotsocr-runpod-serverless\"}]\n\nHere's information about RunPod serverless OpenAI compatible endpoint vLLM configuration:\n\n## OpenAI Compatibility with RunPod vLLM Workers\n\nYou can deploy OpenAI-Compatible Blazing-Fast LLM Endpoints powered by the vLLM Inference Engine on RunPod Serverless with just a few clicks.\n\n### Base URL Format\n\nYou can make OpenAI-compatible API requests to your vLLM workers by sending requests to this base URL pattern.(no content)When initializing the OpenAI Client in your code, change the `api_key` to your RunPod API Key and the `base_url` to your RunPod Serverless Endpoint URL in the following format: `https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR ENDPOINT ID>/openai/v1`. For example, if your Endpoint ID is abc1234, the URL would be `https://api.runpod.ai/v2/abc1234/openai/v1`.\n\n### Key Environment Variables\n\nThe `MODEL_NAME` environment variable is essential for all OpenAI-compatible API requests. This variable corresponds to either the Hugging Face model you've deployed (e.g., `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`) or a custom name if you've set `OPENAI_SERVED_MODEL_NAME_OVERRIDE` as an environment variable. This model name is used in chat and text completion API requests to identify which model should process your request.\n\n### Configuration Options\n\n`MODEL_REVISION`: Model revision to load (default: main). `BASE_PATH`: Storage directory where huggingface cache and model will be located (default: `/runpod-volume`). If your intention is to bake the model into the image, you should set this to something like `/models`.\n\nFor vLLM-specific settings, you can configure `MAX_MODEL_LEN=8192`, `GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION=0.95`, `MAX_NUM_SEQS=256`, `TENSOR_PARALLEL_SIZE=1`. Note: Start with 8192 to conserve memory and increase if you need longer context.\n\n### Python Client Example\n\nYou can initialize the OpenAI Client with your RunPod API Key and Endpoint URL:\n\n```python\nfrom openai import OpenAI\nimport os\n\nclient = OpenAI(\n    api_key=os.environ.get(\"RUNPOD_API_KEY\"),\n    base_url=f\"https://api.runpod.ai/v2/{RUNPOD_ENDPOINT_ID}/openai/v1\",\n)\n```\n\n### Compatibility Notes\n\nThe vLLM Worker is fully compatible with OpenAI's API, and you can use it with any OpenAI Codebase by changing only 3 lines in total.\n\nHowever, there are some differences from OpenAI's implementation:\n- Token counting may differ slightly from OpenAI models due to different tokenizers.\n- Streaming format follows OpenAI's Server-Sent Events (SSE) format, but the exact chunking of streaming responses may vary.\n- Error responses follow a similar but not identical format to OpenAI's error responses.\n\n### Quick Deploy\n\nNavigate to the Serverless tab in your RunPod console and hit the Start button on the Serverless vLLM card under Quick Deploy. This will automatically install vLLM and run it for you as an endpoint.(no content)You are given the option to customize your vLLM model settings. For most models, this is not required to get them running out of the box. But it may be required for your model if you're using a quantized version like GPTQ, in which case you would need to specify the quantization type.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"fd99e6d3-abf0-4b3d-934a-27a48829cc16","timestamp":"2026-01-05T21:26:40.414Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"RunPod serverless OpenAI compatible endpoint vLLM configuration","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01XiCgJFtqpgHYRUEgxTz7ew","content":[{"title":"OpenAI API compatibility guide - Runpod Documentation","url":"https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/vllm/openai-compatibility"},{"title":"GitHub - runpod-workers/worker-vllm: The RunPod worker template for serving our large language model endpoints.

This method, on macOS at least, creates an encryption key and stores it in Keychain Access under \"Code Safe Storage.\" The secrets are encrypted and then stored in a SQLite DB in the user data directory.\n\n### Platform-Specific Storage\n\nThe storage location varies by operating system because VS Code uses each system's native secure storage: On macOS, secrets are stored in Keychain Access. On Windows, they go to Windows Credential Manager. On Linux, they're stored in Keyring.(no content)Additionally, VS Code encrypts the strings before adding them to the keyring to make it harder for other processes and extensions that also have access to the keyring to read the secrets stored with the SecretStorage API.\n\n## Benefits of Using SecretStorage API\n\nUsing VS Code's SecretStorage API means: Keys are encrypted at rest, they're protected by your system's security, nothing ever leaves your machine, and there is no plain text storage anywhere.(no content)Using the SecretStorage API provided by Visual Studio Code is better. This API is cross-platform, and its intention is to store secret or sensitive data.\n\n## Security Considerations\n\nWhile designed for isolated storage for each extension, there is a potential vulnerability that presents a high-risk \"Token Stealing\" attack. A malicious extension could expose third-party application tokens \"securely stored\" by your VS Code IDE. Developers should be cautious with VS Code extensions that integrate with third-party applications.\n\n## General Best Practices for API Key Security\n\nAlways keep API keys in safe key management solutions for storage. Make sure that the keys are encrypted both in transit and at rest. Rotate your API keys regularly to minimize exposure concerns.(no content)The workspace settings are stored in a .vscode/settings.json file in the root of the workspace/project, and this is where a security issue could arise. If you store your keys in the workspace settings and commit those settings to a repository, you are exposing your keys to anyone with access to the repository.(no content)Never store API keys in plaintext or insecure storage. Avoid uploading code containing API keys to public repositories such as GitHub without verifying it for secrets.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"441d4a7a-0705-4b16-b35e-73a7bc7c875e","timestamp":"2026-01-05T21:27:06.163Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Roo Code API key storage security VSCode secret storage best practices","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01UvcurRK3GcToENLAC81NxH","content":[{"title":"Why Every Developer’s API Keys Are Probably in the Wrong Place And how a VS Code Extension Finally Fixed my Messy Secret Management | by Joe Wilson | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@dingersandks/why-every-developers-api-keys-are-probably-in-the-wrong-place-and-how-a-vs-code-extension-finally-c966d081d132"},{"title":"Where are the VS Code extension secrets stored exactly? · microsoft/vscode-discussions · Discussion #748","url":"https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-discussions/discussions/748"},{"title":"VS Code's Token Security: Keeping Your Secrets...

OpenAI-Compatible API Provider Configuration\n\nRoo Code supports OpenAI-compatible providers through its settings panel:\n\n**Configuration Steps:**\n1. Open Roo Code settings (click the gear icon)\n2. Set **API Provider** to \"OpenAI Compatible\"\n3. Configure the following fields:\n   - **Base URL**: `https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID>/openai/v1`\n   - **API Key**: Your RunPod API key\n   - **Model ID**: Your deployed model name (e.g., `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2`)\n\n**Model Configuration Options (Advanced):**\n- Max Output Tokens\n- Context Window\n- Image Support\n- Computer Use capability\n- Input/Output pricing\n\n---\n\n### 2. Settings.json Configuration\n\n**VS Code User Settings (settings.json):**\n```json\n{\n  \"roo-cline.autoImportSettingsPath\": \"~/roo-code-settings.json\"\n}\n```\n\n**Roo Code Settings File (roo-code-settings.json):**\n```json\n{\n  \"apiProvider\": \"openai-compatible\",\n  \"openAiBaseUrl\": \"https://api.runpod.ai/v2/<YOUR_ENDPOINT_ID>/openai/v1\",\n  \"openAiApiKey\": \"<YOUR_RUNPOD_API_KEY>\",\n  \"openAiModelId\": \"<YOUR_MODEL_NAME>\",\n  \"openAiCustomModelInfo\": {\n    \"maxTokens\": 8192,\n    \"contextWindow\": 32768,\n    \"supportsImages\": false\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Access settings.json via:**\n- Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + P) > \"Preferences: Open User Settings (JSON)\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. Known Issues with Custom OpenAI-Compatible Endpoints\n\n**Issue #529 - Multiple OpenAI Compatible Endpoints:**\n- Settings may overwrite when switching between providers\n- Base URLs from one provider can overwrite settings when attempting to switch\n- Newly added providers may not appear in the list immediately\n\n**Workaround:** Use API Configuration Profiles (see section 4) to maintain separate configurations for each endpoint.\n\n**Tool Protocol Fallback:**\n- Some OpenAI-compatible providers only partially implement native tools API\n- If Roo Code detects protocol errors, it automatically falls back to XML-based tools\n- You can manually disable native tools in advanced settings if experiencing issues\n\n---\n\n### 4. Configuring Multiple Model Endpoints (API Configuration Profiles)\n\nRoo Code supports multiple profiles for different providers/models:\n\n**Creating Profiles:**\n1. Open Settings > Providers\n2. Click the \"+\" button next to the profile selector\n3. Name your new profile (e.g., \"RunPod-Mistral\", \"RunPod-Llama\")\n4. Configure API provider, credentials, and model\n\n**Profile Settings Include:**\n- API provider selection\n- Authentication credentials\n- Model choices\n- Temperature parameters\n- Thinking budgets\n- Provider-specific settings\n\n**Switching Between Profiles:**\n- Use the dropdown in Settings panel\n- Use the API Configuration dropdown during active chat sessions\n- Pin frequently-used profiles to the top of the dropdown\n\n**Mode Integration:**\n- Profiles can be linked to specific modes in the Prompts tab\n- The system remembers the last profile used with each mode\n- Example: Use one RunPod endpoint for code generation, another for documentation\n\n**Export/Import JSON Example:**\n```json\n{\n  \"providerProfiles\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"RunPod-Mistral\",\n      \"apiProvider\": \"openai-compatible\",\n      \"baseUrl\": \"https://api.runpod.ai/v2/endpoint1/openai/v1\",\n      \"modelId\": \"mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"name\": \"RunPod-Llama\",\n      \"apiProvider\": \"openai-compatible\",\n      \"baseUrl\": \"https://api.runpod.ai/v2/endpoint2/openai/v1\",\n      \"modelId\": \"meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. API Key Management Best Practices\n\n**How Roo Code Stores Keys:**\n- API keys are stored in VSCode's SecretStorage\n- Keys are encrypted at rest using the system's native secure storage:\n  - macOS: Keychain Access\n  - Windows: Windows Credential Manager\n  - Linux: Keyring\n\n**Security Warning for Export/Import:**\n- Exported JSON files contain API keys in plaintext\n- Treat exported settings files as highly sensitive\n- Never commit settings files with API keys to version control\n\n**Environment Variables (Feature Request Status):**\n- Currently NOT supported natively\n- Proposed environment variable names: `ROO_OPENAI_API_KEY`, etc.\n- Workaround: Store keys outside Roo Code and manually enter them\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Never store API keys in `.vscode/settings.json` (committed to repos)\n2. Use the built-in SecretStorage via the UI for manual entry\n3. For team settings sync, export settings without API keys and have each team member enter their own\n4. Rotate RunPod API keys regularly\n5. Use separate RunPod API keys for development vs production\n\n---\n\n### RunPod Endpoint URL Reference\n\n**Base URL Format:**\n```\nhttps://api.runpod.ai/v2/<ENDPOINT_ID>/openai/v1\n```\n\n**Supported Endpoints:**\n- `/chat/completions` - Chat completions (streaming and non-streaming)\n- `/models` - List available models\n\n**Authentication Header:**\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer <RUNPOD_API_KEY>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Using OpenAI Compatible Providers With Roo Code](https://docs.roocode.com/providers/openai-compatible)\n- [API Configuration Profiles | Roo Code Documentation](https://docs.roocode.com/features/api-configuration-profiles)\n- [Import, Export, and Reset Settings | Roo Code Documentation](https://docs.roocode.com/features/settings-management)\n- [Multiple OpenAI Compatible Endpoints Issue #529](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/529)\n- [API keys from environment variables Discussion #2057](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/2057)\n- [RunPod vLLM Worker - GitHub](https://github.com/runpod-workers/worker-vllm)\n- [OpenAI compatibility | RunPod Documentation](https://docs.runpod.io/serverless/workers/vllm/openai-compatibility)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":989,"cache_read_input_tokens":29213,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":989,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWpwUmZ1EKx1zgftuc65E","type":"assistant","uuid":"efdd392e-5fc8-4e50-a718-f1e23422df4a","timestamp":"2026-01-05T21:28:06.612Z"}
