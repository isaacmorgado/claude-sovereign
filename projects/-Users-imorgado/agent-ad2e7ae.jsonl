As of Premiere Pro 25.6, CEP extensions to Premiere Pro have been superseded by UXP Extensibility.(no content)If you are starting new development, Adobe recommends starting in UXP. CEP extensions continue to be supported; the plan is to support both CEP and UXP for a calendar year, after which Adobe will remove support for CEP extensibility.\n\n### CEP 12 - The Final Major CEP Version\n\nCEP 12 shipped with Photoshop 25.12, Premiere Pro 25.0, and After Effects 25.0. InDesign and Illustrator will come later. CEP 12 will be the last major update to CEP, although critical security issues will continue to be addressed. There are no new features planned further.(no content)CEP 12 now supports a newer version of Chromium 99, updated v8 to 9.9.115, and updated the deprecated OpenGL APIs to Metal on Mac.\n\n## Official Resources\n\n### For UXP Development (Recommended for New Projects)\nUXP samples are available at https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples/tree/main. Documentation is at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/. There's also a Premiere Pro UXP Developer Forum at https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/c/uxp-for-premiere-pro/105.\n\n### For CEP Development (Legacy)\n- Code samples for CEP extensions are available at the Adobe-CEP/Samples GitHub repository.\n- The PProPanel sample is the right starting point.

As of Premiere Pro 25.6, CEP extensions to Premiere Pro have been superseded by UXP Extensibility.(no content)If you are starting new development, Adobe recommends starting in UXP. CEP extensions continue to be supported; the plan is to support both CEP and UXP for a calendar year, after which Adobe will remove support for CEP extensibility.\n\n### CEP 12 - The Final Major CEP Version\n\nCEP 12 shipped with Photoshop 25.12, Premiere Pro 25.0, and After Effects 25.0. InDesign and Illustrator will come later. CEP 12 will be the last major update to CEP, although critical security issues will continue to be addressed. There are no new features planned further.(no content)CEP 12 now supports a newer version of Chromium 99, updated v8 to 9.9.115, and updated the deprecated OpenGL APIs to Metal on Mac.\n\n## Official Resources\n\n### For UXP Development (Recommended for New Projects)\nUXP samples are available at https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples/tree/main. Documentation is at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/. There's also a Premiere Pro UXP Developer Forum at https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/c/uxp-for-premiere-pro/105.\n\n### For CEP Development (Legacy)\n- Code samples for CEP extensions are available at the Adobe-CEP/Samples GitHub repository.\n- The PProPanel sample is the right starting point. PPro's ExtendScript API docs are also available.\n- CEP 12 documentation is available at: https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_12.x/Documentation/\n\n### How CEP Works\nWhile the JavaScript layer of CEP is up-to-date and flexible to use, when it comes to communicating with the host application, ExtendScript is still needed.

Access the CEP Resources page to download the toolkit for your platform. You can use this tool to create a self-signed certificate, create a signed ZXP package, or verify an existing ZXP package.(no content)There's an updated ZXP Sign Command tool available at version 4.1.3 on GitHub (https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/ZXPSignCMD/4.1.3).\n\n## Certificate Types\n\nThere are two types of code-signing certificate: commercial certificates provided by a trusted certificate authority, and self-signed certificates.(no content)Packaged extensions must be signed with a certificate, but a self-signed certificate is fine in most cases.(no content)Free extensions can be self-signed, so there are no costs anywhere for getting started. The repository also supports paid and subscription models, but you'll need a purchased CA cert for those.\n\n## Timestamps\n\nA valid timestamp ensures that the certificate used to sign the extension was valid at the time of signing. For this reason, you should always add a timestamp to the signature when you package and sign your extension. A timestamp has the effect of extending the validity of the digital signature.\n\n## 2024 Known Issue: Cross-Platform Signing Compatibility\n\nThe problem: ZXP files signed on macOS are failing when installed and run on Windows machines, and vice versa. On Windows, this may mean that the installed panel appears blank, or only functions as expected with debug mode enabled. Expected Behavior: Historically ZXP files signed by ZXPSignCmd may be installed and used successfully on both macOS and Windows, regardless of which platform they were signed on.\n\n### Workaround\nFor the time being, the workaround is to sign ZXPs on the platform they are expected to be run on. Sign ZXPs for use with macOS on a macOS machine, and ZXPs intended for Windows on Windows devices.\n\n### Best Practices to Avoid Issues\nDelete all .DS_Store and __MACOSX folders/files inside your extension directory/subdirectories. Make sure that you don't have any symlinks inside your folders. Some node modules use symlinks, so it's the best to look for symlinks inside the node_modules folder and get rid of those.(no content)It's important to do this if you're planning on distributing in Adobe's Marketplaces, because the developer portal will reject your ZXP upload. While you're at it, delete any zero byte files, as these are also not allowed.\n\n## Distribution Options\n\nThe recommended way of distributing extensions is Adobe's \"Add-ons\" repository. Distributing them directly works fine too, but is a bit less convenient for the end user.(no content)Be aware, though, that Adobe Add-ons is a curated market (similar to most app stores). Each extension is reviewed (by a person!), and must meet various approval guidelines before becoming available to users.\n\n## Installation Tools\n\nAnastasiy's extension manager is a third-party developed tool that can help you install extensions packaged in .zxp format. Download and install Anastasiy's extension manager and follow the instructions.\n\n## Issue with DigiCert/PKCS#11 Certificates\n\nThere's concern that new signing methods won't be usable with ZXPSignCmd unless ZXPSignCmd developers contact DigiCert and collaborate on adding support for DigiCert's SMCTL and/or PKCS11/KSP. Other CAs too. After a couple of hours of experimenting this looks like the case.(no content)There's a GitHub ticket for this now (Issue #550 on Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources) for ZXPSignCmd PKCS#11 support.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"2fb16afb-bef0-497c-a8dd-2cce5ef81f5e","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:00:55.033Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe CEP ZXP signing distribution certificate packaging 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_019buLeVetQ3nA4nXvBFhsGf","content":[{"title":"Getting-Started-guides/Package Distribute Install at master · Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/tree/master/Package%20Distribute%20Install"},{"title":"Packaging signing Adobe CEP Panel in details | autoEdit 2 Documentation","url":"https://autoedit.gitbook.io/documentation/adobe-panel/packaging-adobe-cep-extensions/packaging-signing-adobe-cep-panel-in-details"},{"title":"CEP Guide Part 7: Packaging and Distribution | fenomas.com","url":"https://fenomas.com/2014/09/cep-5-distribution-en/"},{"title":"Getting-Started-guides/Package Distribute Install/readme.md at master · Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/blob/master/Package%20Distribute%20Install/readme.md"},{"title":"Resources","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/developer-distribution/creative-cloud/docs/guides/zxp/resources"},{"title":"Cross-platform ZXP Signing Compatibility Known Issue and Workaround 2024","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/exchange-bugs/cross-platform-zxp-signing-compatibility-known-issue-and-workaround-2024/idi-p/14961412"},{"title":"Guidance Needed for CEP Extension Digital Signing and Certification","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/guidance-needed-for-cep-extension-digital-signing-and-certification/td-p/15428200"},{"title":"how to install the CEP extension properly · Issue #47 · Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/issues/47"},{"title":"CEP Guide Part 7: Packaging and Distribution | fenomas.com","url":"https://aphall.com/2014/09/cep-5-distribution-en/"},{"title":"Re: Cross-platform ZXP Signing Compatibility Known Issue and Workaround 2024","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/exchange-bugs/cross-platform-zxp-signing-compatibility-known-issue-and-workaround-2024/idc-p/14968230"}]},"Here are the search results for Adobe CEP ZXP signing, distribution, certificate, and packaging:\n\n## Overview\n\nAfter you have successfully built your extension, you should package the extension in the ZXP format and sign the extension with a valid certificate in order to distribute your extension properly.\n\n## ZXPSignCmd Tool\n\nAdobe provides a command-line tool, ZXPSignCmd, that you can use to package and sign extensions.

On Windows, this may mean that the installed panel appears blank, or only functions as expected with debug mode enabled. Expected Behavior: Historically ZXP files signed by ZXPSignCmd may be installed and used successfully on both macOS and Windows, regardless of which platform they were signed on.\n\n### Workaround\nFor the time being, the workaround is to sign ZXPs on the platform they are expected to be run on. Sign ZXPs for use with macOS on a macOS machine, and ZXPs intended for Windows on Windows devices.\n\n### Best Practices to Avoid Issues\nDelete all .DS_Store and __MACOSX folders/files inside your extension directory/subdirectories. Make sure that you don't have any symlinks inside your folders. Some node modules use symlinks, so it's the best to look for symlinks inside the node_modules folder and get rid of those.(no content)It's important to do this if you're planning on distributing in Adobe's Marketplaces, because the developer portal will reject your ZXP upload. While you're at it, delete any zero byte files, as these are also not allowed.\n\n## Distribution Options\n\nThe recommended way of distributing extensions is Adobe's \"Add-ons\" repository. Distributing them directly works fine too, but is a bit less convenient for the end user.(no content)Be aware, though, that Adobe Add-ons is a curated market (similar to most app stores). Each extension is reviewed (by a person!), and must meet various approval guidelines before becoming available to users.\n\n## Installation Tools\n\nAnastasiy's extension manager is a third-party developed tool that can help you install extensions packaged in .zxp format. Download and install Anastasiy's extension manager and follow the instructions.\n\n## Issue with DigiCert/PKCS#11 Certificates\n\nThere's concern that new signing methods won't be usable with ZXPSignCmd unless ZXPSignCmd developers contact DigiCert and collaborate on adding support for DigiCert's SMCTL and/or PKCS11/KSP. Other CAs too. After a couple of hours of experimenting this looks like the case.(no content)There's a GitHub ticket for this now (Issue #550 on Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources) for ZXPSignCmd PKCS#11 support."],"durationSeconds":27.133328457999973}}

The ID should match the Extension ID in your manifest (not the ExtensionBundleID), while the host name specifies which tool you're testing in.(no content)List the Host IDs for each app your extension supports, with a corresponding port of your choosing for debugging. The full list of host application ports is available in the CEP Cookbook.\n\n### Step 3: Connect with Chrome DevTools\n\nOpen Chrome and go to http://localhost:8088/ or whichever port you set in your .debug file.(no content)If your panel is working, you'll see the name of your extension as a link you can click on.(no content)The link will take you to the JavaScript Console within Chromium DevTools. The JavaScript Console is where, among other things, you will see your extension's log and error output.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf your debug console in Chrome appears blank, check the contents of your .debug file: Does your extension ID in the .debug file match what's in manifest.xml? Are you listing the supported host app(s) correctly with the right Host ID(s)? Are you attempting to access localhost on the same port that you have indicated in your debug console?\n\n### Alternative: CEF Client\n\nDebugging the JavaScript Layer (Chromium + Node.js) is accomplished with Chrome Dev Tools.

In the main.js you use `csInterface.evalScript('jsxFun()', callback)` where callback is a function defined somewhere (or anonymous).\n\n### Asynchronous Nature\n\nThe default behavior shows that `csInterface.evalScript('app.documents.length', function(result) { numberOfDocuments = result; })` assigns the result to a variable, but an alert immediately after says \"undefined\" because of the asynchronous nature of evalScript - the interpreter goes ahead to the next line without waiting for the ExtendScript to return.\n\n### Callback Function Structure\n\nThe evalScript function takes two params: the ExtendScript code to run, and a callback function which in turn takes as a param the returned value from the ExtendScript call.\n\n### Handling the Async Issue\n\nIf the alert is moved within the callback it works properly. However, this can lead to the so-called \"callback hell\" – nesting evalScript calls one inside another.(no content)The callback is asynchronous so the second alert will not wait for the result from the callback. You need to use a promise.\n\n### Passing Data Between JS and JSX\n\nThe panel's JS can send ExtendScript strings to the host application by means of the evalScript() function. On the other side, the host application can send strings back to the panel that the evalScript() second parameter callback is able to receive.(no content)If you need to pass complex parameters such as objects from your panel's JS to the host app's JSX, JSON.stringify() them first (no need to JSON.parse() them in the JSX – they arrive as objects). If you need to pass an object the other way around (from the host application JSX to the panel JS), you need to JSON.stringify() it in the JSX first, and JSON.parse() it in the JS.\n\n### Passing Primitive Parameters\n\nFor primitive, multiple parameters this is easily done via CSInterface.evalScript() in the main.js: `csInterface.evalScript('sayHello(\"Ciao\", 2014)')` and providing a corresponding function in the JSX file.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nIn case of errors thrown on the JSX side, the returned value is always the \"EvalScript error.\" string.\n\n### Promise-Based Alternative\n\nThere's an interface for CEP panels to run Adobe ExtendScript evals and files (with arguments) as promises with cross-compatibility for AMD and node.js require. This can help avoid callback hell.\n\n### Event-Based Communication (Alternative Pattern)\n\nAn alternative pattern uses CSXSEvent for communication. In the JSX you create a CSXSEvent object with a type and data, then dispatch it.

In the main.js you use `csInterface.evalScript('jsxFun()', callback)` where callback is a function defined somewhere (or anonymous).\n\n### Asynchronous Nature\n\nThe default behavior shows that `csInterface.evalScript('app.documents.length', function(result) { numberOfDocuments = result; })` assigns the result to a variable, but an alert immediately after says \"undefined\" because of the asynchronous nature of evalScript - the interpreter goes ahead to the next line without waiting for the ExtendScript to return.\n\n### Callback Function Structure\n\nThe evalScript function takes two params: the ExtendScript code to run, and a callback function which in turn takes as a param the returned value from the ExtendScript call.\n\n### Handling the Async Issue\n\nIf the alert is moved within the callback it works properly. However, this can lead to the so-called \"callback hell\" – nesting evalScript calls one inside another.(no content)The callback is asynchronous so the second alert will not wait for the result from the callback. You need to use a promise.\n\n### Passing Data Between JS and JSX\n\nThe panel's JS can send ExtendScript strings to the host application by means of the evalScript() function. On the other side, the host application can send strings back to the panel that the evalScript() second parameter callback is able to receive.(no content)If you need to pass complex parameters such as objects from your panel's JS to the host app's JSX, JSON.stringify() them first (no need to JSON.parse() them in the JSX – they arrive as objects). If you need to pass an object the other way around (from the host application JSX to the panel JS), you need to JSON.stringify() it in the JSX first, and JSON.parse() it in the JS.\n\n### Passing Primitive Parameters\n\nFor primitive, multiple parameters this is easily done via CSInterface.evalScript() in the main.js: `csInterface.evalScript('sayHello(\"Ciao\", 2014)')` and providing a corresponding function in the JSX file.\n\n### Error Handling\n\nIn case of errors thrown on the JSX side, the returned value is always the \"EvalScript error.\" string.\n\n### Promise-Based Alternative\n\nThere's an interface for CEP panels to run Adobe ExtendScript evals and files (with arguments) as promises with cross-compatibility for AMD and node.js require. This can help avoid callback hell.\n\n### Event-Based Communication (Alternative Pattern)\n\nAn alternative pattern uses CSXSEvent for communication. In the JSX you create a CSXSEvent object with a type and data, then dispatch it. In the JS you set up a listener using `csInterface.addEventListener()` to handle the event."],"durationSeconds":29.09417075000005}}

ExtensionManifest (Root Element)**\n\nThe root element contains bundle-level attributes. Here's an example from official Adobe samples:\n\n```xml\n<ExtensionManifest xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" \n    ExtensionBundleId=\"com.adobe.CEPHTMLTEST\" \n    ExtensionBundleVersion=\"1.0\" \n    Version=\"6.0\">\n```\n\n**2.

Available types include:\n\n- **Panel** - behaves like any other application panel. It can be docked, participates in workspaces, has fly-out menus, and is re-opened at start-up if open at shutdown.\n- **Modal Dialog** - opens a new extension window and forces the user to interact only with the extension window before returning control to the host application.\n- **Modeless Dialog** - opens a new extension window but doesn't force the user to interact with the extension window. An Embedded Panel is the same as a Panel, but it cannot be undocked.\n- **Custom (Invisible)** - for invisible extensions that remain hidden and never become visible during their whole life cycle.\n\nFor more detailed documentation, you can refer to the official [Adobe CEP Resources on GitHub](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"096de7bb-30f0-415e-b2f7-534ff018c2c0","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:02:11.443Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CEP manifest.xml structure ExtensionManifest HostList RequiredRuntimeList example","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Ka3sNybJ2xkvnsKFZc4CYd","content":[{"title":"CEP Guide Part 2: Getting Started | fenomas.com","url":"https://fenomas.com/2014/08/cep-5-getting-started-en/"},{"title":"Samples/PProPanel/CSXS/manifest.xml at master · Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/CSXS/manifest.xml"},{"title":"CEP-Resources/CEP_8.x/Documentation/CEP 8.0 HTML Extension Cookbook.md at master · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_8.x/Documentation/CEP 8.0 HTML Extension Cookbook.md"},{"title":"CEP-Resources/CEP_7.x/Samples/CEP_HTML_Test_Extension-7.0/CSXS/manifest.xml at master · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_7.x/Samples/CEP_HTML_Test_Extension-7.0/CSXS/manifest.xml"},{"title":"CEP-Resources/CEP_9.x/Samples/CEP_HTML_Test_Extension-9.0/CSXS/manifest.xml at master · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_9.x/Samples/CEP_HTML_Test_Extension-9.0/CSXS/manifest.xml"},{"title":"manifest.xml | autoEdit 2 Documentation","url":"https://autoedit.gitbook.io/documentation/adobe-panel/autoedit-adobe-cep-panel-dev-setup/manifest.xml"},{"title":"CEP-Resources/CEP_10.x/Samples/CEP_HTML_Test_Extension-10.0/CSXS/manifest.xml at master · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_10.x/Samples/CEP_HTML_Test_Extension-10.0/CSXS/manifest.xml"},{"title":"Samples/XmpSamplePanel/CSXS/manifest.xml at master · Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/XmpSamplePanel/CSXS/manifest.xml"},{"title":"CEP-Resources/CEP_11.x/Documentation/CEP 11.1 HTML Extension Cookbook.md at master · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_11.x/Documentation/CEP 11.1 HTML Extension Cookbook.md"},{"title":"CEP-Resources/CEP_9.x/Documentation/CEP 9.0 HTML Extension Cookbook.md at master · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_9.x/Documentation/CEP 9.0 HTML Extension Cookbook.md"}]},"Based on the search results, here's comprehensive information about the CEP manifest.xml structure with ExtensionManifest, HostList, and RequiredRuntimeList:\n\n## CEP manifest.xml Structure\n\nThe XML manifest must live at: `/CSXS/manifest.xml` (CSXS being the old name of CEP).\n\n### Basic Structure\n\nThe manifest actually defines an extension bundle, which can include more than one extension - hence properties like `ExtensionBundleName` and `ExtensionList`.\n\n### Key Components\n\n**1.

ExtendScript support is planned through September 2026.\n\n**Recommendation**: If starting new development, strongly consider UXP instead. Use CEP only if you need features not yet available in UXP or must support older Premiere Pro versions.\n\n---\n\n## 1.

Build System\n\n### Recommended: Bolt CEP (Vite-based)\n\n**Installation**:\n```bash\nnpx create-bolt-cep my-extension\ncd my-extension\nnpm install\n```\n\n**Configuration (cep.config.ts)**:\n```typescript\nimport { CEPConfig } from 'vite-cep-plugin';\n\nconst config: CEPConfig = {\n  version: '1.0.0',\n  id: 'com.yourcompany.ppro.extension',\n  displayName: 'Your Extension',\n  symlink: 'local',\n  port: 3000,\n  servePort: 5000,\n  startingDebugPort: 8860,\n  \n  panels: [\n    {\n      mainPath: './src/js/main/index.html',\n      name: 'main',\n      panelDisplayName: 'Your Extension Panel',\n      autoVisible: true,\n      width: 300,\n      height: 400,\n      minWidth: 200,\n      minHeight: 200,\n    },\n  ],\n  \n  build: {\n    jsxBin: 'off', // 'off' | 'copy' | 'replace'\n    sourceMap: true,\n  },\n  \n  zxp: {\n    country: 'US',\n    province: 'CA',\n    org: 'Your Company',\n    password: 'your-cert-password',\n    tsa: 'http://timestamp.digicert.com/',\n    sourceMap: false,\n    jsxBin: 'replace',\n  },\n  \n  installModules: [],\n  copyAssets: ['public'],\n  copyZipAssets: [],\n};\n\nexport default config;\n```\n\n**Build Commands**:\n```bash\nnpm run dev      # Development with HMR\nnpm run build    # Production build\nnpm run zxp      # Package signed ZXP\nnpm run zip      # Create distribution archive\n```\n\n### Alternative: Webpack Setup\n\n```javascript\n// webpack.config.js\nconst path = require('path');\nconst CopyPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');\nconst HtmlWebpackPlugin = require('html-webpack-plugin');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n  mode: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development',\n  entry: './src/js/main.js',\n  output: {\n    path: path.resolve(__dirname, 'dist'),\n    filename: 'js/bundle.js',\n  },\n  module: {\n    rules: [\n      {\n        test: /\\.jsx?$/,\n        exclude: /node_modules/,\n        use: {\n          loader: 'babel-loader',\n          options: {\n            presets: ['@babel/preset-env'],\n          },\n        },\n      },\n      {\n        test: /\\.css$/,\n        use: ['style-loader', 'css-loader'],\n      },\n    ],\n  },\n  plugins: [\n    new HtmlWebpackPlugin({\n      template: './src/index.html',\n    }),\n    new CopyPlugin({\n      patterns: [\n        { from: 'CSXS', to: 'CSXS' },\n        { from: 'jsx', to: 'jsx' },\n        { from: '.debug', to: '.debug' },\n        { from: 'node_modules/cep-lib/CSInterface.js', to: 'js/lib/CSInterface.js' },\n      ],\n    }),\n  ],\n  devtool: 'source-map',\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Debug Configuration\n\n### .debug File\n\nCreate `.debug` in extension root:\n\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<ExtensionList>\n    <Extension Id=\"com.yourcompany.ppro.extension.panel\">\n        <HostList>\n            <Host Name=\"PPRO\" Port=\"8860\"/>\n        </HostList>\n    </Extension>\n</ExtensionList>\n```\n\n### Enable Debug Mode\n\n**macOS** (Terminal):\n```bash\n# For CEP 12 (Premiere Pro 2025)\ndefaults write com.adobe.CSXS.12 PlayerDebugMode 1\n\n# For CEP 11 (Premiere Pro 2024)\ndefaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11 PlayerDebugMode 1\n\n# For multiple versions\nfor i in {8..12}; do defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.$i PlayerDebugMode 1; done\n```\n\n**Windows** (Registry):\n```\nHKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Adobe\\CSXS.12\nKey: PlayerDebugMode\nType: String\nValue: 1\n```\n\n### Chrome DevTools Connection\n\n1. Start Premiere Pro and open your extension\n2. Open Chrome browser\n3. Navigate to `http://localhost:8860` (or your configured port)\n4. Click your extension name to open DevTools\n\n### ExtendScript Debugging\n\nUse VS Code with the [ExtendScript Debugger extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Adobe.extendscript-debug):\n\n```json\n// .vscode/launch.json\n{\n  \"version\": \"0.2.0\",\n  \"configurations\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"extendscript-debug\",\n      \"request\": \"attach\",\n      \"name\": \"Attach to Premiere Pro\",\n      \"hostAppSpecifier\": \"premierepro-22.0\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Signing and Distribution\n\n### Self-Signed Certificate (Development/Free Distribution)\n\n```bash\n# Download ZXPSignCmd from Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources\n# Create self-signed certificate\n./ZXPSignCmd -selfSignedCert US CA \"Your Company\" \"Your Name\" password123 certificate.p12\n\n# Sign the extension\n./ZXPSignCmd -sign ./dist ./YourExtension.zxp certificate.p12 password123 -tsa http://timestamp.digicert.com/\n```\n\n### 2024 Known Issue: Cross-Platform Signing\n\n**Problem**: ZXP files signed on macOS may fail on Windows and vice versa.\n\n**Workaround**: Sign on the target platform:\n- Sign macOS versions on macOS\n- Sign Windows versions on Windows\n\n**Best Practices**:\n```bash\n# Before signing, clean up:\nfind ./dist -name \".DS_Store\" -delete\nfind ./dist -name \"__MACOSX\" -type d -exec rm -rf {} +\nfind ./dist -type l -delete  # Remove symlinks\nfind ./dist -empty -delete   # Remove empty files\n```\n\n### ZXP Packaging Script\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\n# build-zxp.sh\n\nVERSION=\"1.0.0\"\nEXTENSION_NAME=\"YourExtension\"\nCERT_FILE=\"certificate.p12\"\nCERT_PASS=\"your-password\"\nTSA=\"http://timestamp.digicert.com/\"\n\n# Clean build\nrm -rf dist\nnpm run build\n\n# Clean problematic files\nfind ./dist -name \".DS_Store\" -delete\nfind ./dist -name \"*.map\" -delete\n\n# Sign\n./tools/ZXPSignCmd -sign ./dist \"./${EXTENSION_NAME}_v${VERSION}.zxp\" $CERT_FILE $CERT_PASS -tsa $TSA\n\n# Verify\n./tools/ZXPSignCmd -verify \"./${EXTENSION_NAME}_v${VERSION}.zxp\" -certInfo\n```\n\n### Installation Methods\n\n1. **Adobe Exchange** (Recommended for distribution): Submit ZXP to [Adobe Exchange](https://exchange.adobe.com/)\n\n2. **Anastasiy's Extension Manager**: Third-party tool for installing ZXP files\n\n3. **Manual Installation**:\n   - macOS: `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/`\n   - Windows: `C:\\Users\\<user>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\CEP\\extensions\\`\n\n---\n\n## 7. Version Compatibility\n\n### CEP Version Matrix\n\n| CEP Version | Premiere Pro Version | Chrome Version |\n|-------------|---------------------|----------------|\n| CEP 12      | 25.0+ (2025)        | Chromium 99    |\n| CEP 11      | 22.0-24.x (2022-2024)| Chromium 88   |\n| CEP 10      | 14.0-21.x (2020-2021)| Chromium 74   |\n| CEP 9       | 13.x (2019)         | Chromium 61    |\n\n### Multi-Version Support in Manifest\n\n```xml\n<ExecutionEnvironment>\n    <HostList>\n        <!-- Support Premiere Pro 2020 through 2025+ -->\n        <Host Name=\"PPRO\" Version=\"[14.0,99.9]\"/>\n    </HostList>\n    <RequiredRuntimeList>\n        <!-- Minimum CEP version required -->\n        <RequiredRuntime Name=\"CSXS\" Version=\"10.0\"/>\n    </RequiredRuntimeList>\n</ExecutionEnvironment>\n```\n\n### Runtime Version Detection\n\n```javascript\n// js/main.js\nconst csInterface = new CSInterface();\n\nfunction checkCompatibility() {\n    const hostEnv = csInterface.hostEnvironment;\n    const appVersion = parseFloat(hostEnv.appVersion);\n    const cepVersion = hostEnv.CEPVersion;\n    \n    console.log(`Premiere Pro: ${appVersion}`);\n    console.log(`CEP Version: ${cepVersion}`);\n    \n    // Feature detection\n    if (appVersion >= 25.0) {\n        // Premiere Pro 2025 features\n        enableNewFeatures();\n    } else if (appVersion >= 22.0) {\n        // Premiere Pro 2022-2024 features\n        enableLegacyMode();\n    }\n    \n    return {\n        pproVersion: appVersion,\n        cepVersion: cepVersion,\n        isSupported: appVersion >= 14.0\n    };\n}\n```\n\n### ExtendScript Version Handling\n\n```javascript\n// jsx/hostscript.jsx\nMyExtension.compatibility = {\n    \n    getPProVersion: function() {\n        return parseFloat(app.version);\n    },\n    \n    hasFeature: function(featureName) {\n        var version = this.getPProVersion();\n        \n        var featureMap = {\n            'audioChannelMapping': version >= 13.0,\n            'productionWorkflows': version >= 14.0,\n            'essentialGraphics': version >= 12.0,\n            'captionsAPI': version >= 15.0\n        };\n        \n        return featureMap[featureName] || false;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Quick Start Checklist\n\n1. **Choose Your Path**: UXP for new projects (future-proof), CEP for legacy support\n2. **Use Bolt CEP**: Modern Vite-based toolchain with TypeScript support\n3. **Structure Code**: Separate JS (panel), JSX (ExtendScript), and CSXS (config)\n4. **Promise-Wrap evalScript**: Avoid callback hell with async/await pattern\n5. **Enable Debug Mode**: Set PlayerDebugMode registry/defaults for development\n6. **Test Cross-Platform**: Sign on target platforms due to 2024 signing issue\n7. **Version Guard**: Check app version before using newer APIs\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Adobe-CEP/Samples - PProPanel](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel)\n- [Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources)\n- [Bolt CEP Framework](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-cep)\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [Adobe Tech Blog - CEP Updates](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/updates-for-creative-cloud-desktop-extensibility-0dd5c663563e)\n- [Adobe CEP Getting Started Guides](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides)\n- [Davide Barranca - Async evalScript Patterns](https://www.davidebarranca.com/2014/12/html-panels-tips-15-asynchronous-vs-synchronous-evalscript/)\n- [Cross-Platform ZXP Signing Issue 2024](https://community.adobe.com/t5/exchange-bugs/cross-platform-zxp-signing-compatibility-known-issue-and-workaround-2024/idi-p/14961412)\n- [Adobe UXP for Premiere Pro](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":413,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2091,"cache_read_input_tokens":24020,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2091,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWBWq34RKB7KA15QU6VhD","type":"assistant","uuid":"ba79154e-bec4-4996-b13e-184b0727dd46","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:04:01.794Z"}
