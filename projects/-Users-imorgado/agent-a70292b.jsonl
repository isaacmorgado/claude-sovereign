Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n## Key Results for \"Premiere Pro UXP QE enableQE\"\n\n### QE (Quality Engineering) API Usage\n\nThe Adobe CEP Samples repository shows how `app.enableQE()` is used in ExtendScript to enable the QE DOM, which then allows access to functions like `qe.project.newSequence()` and source player controls like `qe.source.player.startScrubbing()`, `qe.source.player.scrubTo()`, and `qe.source.player.endScrubbing()`.(no content)The PremiereRemote project demonstrates using `app.enableQE()` in a function like: \n```javascript\nfunction lockVideoLayer(layerNumber) { \n  app.enableQE(); \n  var activeSequence = qe.project.getActiveSequence(); \n  var someTrack = activeSequence.getVideoTrackAt(layerNumber); \n  someTrack.setLock(true); \n}\n```\n\n### About the QE API\n\nThe QE (Quality Engineering) API is used by Adobe to run automated tests for development purposes. Although it is not officially supported by Adobe, it is usable alongside the official API. The pymiere library offers an entry point to QE using `pymiere.objects.qe`.(no content)Note that QE is not fail-proof and you may crash Premiere while exploring it. Also, some of the methods seem to not be working or proper arguments are unknown.\n\n### UXP in Premiere Pro\n\nThe AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples repository explains how to develop UXP plugins within Premiere Pro. As of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins. The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.(no content)UXP scripting in Premiere Pro is experimental and limited. Some features (like timeline and sequence editing) may not be available yet. For full automation, use the CEP (legacy) panel.\n\n### Related Resources\n\n- **GitHub - amirul181/Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Quality-Engineering-QE-Unofficial-Documentation**: This repository provides unofficial documentation for Adobe Premiere Pro's Quality Engineering (QE) API.\n\n- **GitHub - hyperbrew/bolt-uxp**: A lightning-fast boilerplate for building Adobe UXP Plugins in Svelte, React, or Vue built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"2c5a30f1-5c11-40df-9848-74429fa26b95","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:39:29.464Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"site:github.com Premiere Pro UXP QE enableQE","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01SRyrjDPXPnQWAr6aKam4M2","content":[{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro"},{"title":"uxp-premiere-pro-samples/README.md at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples/blob/main/README.md"},{"title":"Samples/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx at master · Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx"},{"title":"GitHub - hetpatel-11/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP: Adobe Premiere Pro MCP","url":"https://github.com/hetpatel-11/Adobe_Premiere_Pro_MCP"},{"title":"GitHub - amirul181/Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Quality-Engineering-QE-Unofficial-Documentation: Adobe Premiere Pro Quality Engineering (QE) Unofficial Documentation","url":"https://github.com/amirul181/Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Quality-Engineering-QE-Unofficial-Documentation"},{"title":"GitHub - hyperbrew/bolt-uxp: A lightning-fast boilerplate for building Adobe UXP Plugins in Svelte, React, or Vue built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass","url":"https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp"},{"title":"pymiere/example_and_documentation.md at master · qmasingarbe/pymiere","url":"https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere/blob/master/example_and_documentation.md"},{"title":"GitHub - sebinside/PremiereRemote: Using the Adobe Premiere Extension mechanism, PremiereRemote provides a framework to trigger your own Premiere CEP-based functionality from outside of Premiere, e.g., by using AutoHotkey.","url":"https://github.com/sebinside/PremiereRemote"},{"title":"uxp-premiere-pro/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts"}]},"Based on the search results, I found several relevant GitHub repositories related to Premiere Pro UXP, QE, and the `enableQE` function.

ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n## UXP API Design for Transition from ExtendScript\n\nIn UXP, a method call is asynchronous and does not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition between the ExtendScript DOM and the UXP DOM, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n## QE (Quality Engineering) Library Workaround in ExtendScript\n\nFor functionality not directly available in the standard ExtendScript API, there's a workaround using the QE library. Users have discovered that calling methods like the RAZOR method requires enabling the QE library first. The workaround involves:\n\nSample working code involves enabling the Quality Engineering library with `app.enableQE()`, then getting the active QE sequence with `qe.project.getActiveSequence()`, and using QE's razor method that can be called on a sequence object.\n\n## CEP Extensions Bridge Architecture\n\nCEP Extensions are comprised of a JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend built on Node.js + Chromium (similar to NW.js) and an ExtendScript backend for interacting with the host application. UXP Plugins are also JavaScript/HTML/CSS based but built on Adobe's own unique stack which makes them far less resource heavy. Instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has one unified environment for frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction back and forth.\n\n## Current Recommendations\n\nNo further changes or improvements to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled. Any such changes will be reconsidered once Premiere Pro moves to UXP-based extensibility.(no content)Adobe's first goal with UXP is parity with what ExtendScript could already do. Applying effects now works, and UXP plugins can make Undo groupings instead of introducing a new Undo item with each API call.(no content)For workarounds involving global keypresses, developers have created separate programs that run in the background as global keyboard hooks with websocket servers, where the server can talk to the extension JavaScript which can in turn call the ExtendScript.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8955e08f-a63d-4401-a0bc-7e06feb4f615","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:40:37.462Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro UXP bridge ExtendScript QE workaround call","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01FNF1xdCx3rKngNPBi9Gjwq","content":[{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Extensions - To UXP or not to UXP - Adobe Product Community - 11326933","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-extensions-to-uxp-or-not-to-uxp/td-p/11326933"},{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Scripting ExtendScript question - Adobe Product Community - 13379442","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-extendscript-question/td-p/13379442"},{"title":"Premiere and UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/"},{"title":"Scripts vs Extensions vs Plugins — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/scripts-extensions-plugins/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro UXP Beta — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/"},{"title":"Solved: UXP: Everything I need to know? - Adobe Product Community - 15476462","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-everything-i-need-to-know/m-p/15476462"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about Premiere Pro UXP bridge ExtendScript QE workaround calls:\n\n## Current State of UXP and ExtendScript in Premiere Pro\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).

For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### Migration Considerations\n\nAs of Premiere Pro 25.6, CEP extensions to Premiere Pro have been superseded by UXP Extensibility.

When you call `app.enableQE()`, it returns true if QE DOM was enabled.(no content)The QE API allows developers to undo specific actions by calling `qe.project.undo()`. This functionality is not part of the official API.(no content)An important feature missing from the official API is the ability to apply effects on a clip.

ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n## Key Differences Between Legacy APIs and UXP\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition between the ExtendScript DOM and the UXP DOM, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.(no content)This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes.

The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin shows how to clone and remove track items - this can serve as a workaround pattern for some operations.\n\n2. If your plugin depends on APIs added in newer Premiere versions but the user is on an older version, you should target APIs common to both versions or implement fallback logic for older releases when possible.\n\n3.

There is no documented way to call `app.enableQE()` or access the `qe` global object from a UXP plugin.\n\n---\n\n## Detailed Findings\n\n### 1. Can `app.enableQE()` be called from UXP?\n\n**NO.** The `app.enableQE()` function is part of the ExtendScript API. UXP uses a completely different architecture with its own native JavaScript API. There is no `enableQE()` method in the UXP Premiere API.\n\n- UXP has \"1 unified environment for your frontend code and host API calls\" - it does not use ExtendScript at all\n- The UXP API is accessed via `require('premierepro')`, not through the legacy `app` global object\n\n**Source:** [Hyper Brew - Premiere Pro UXP Beta](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Is the global `qe` object available in UXP context?\n\n**NO.** The `qe` global object only exists in the ExtendScript context. UXP does not expose this object.\n\n- In ExtendScript: After calling `app.enableQE()`, the `qe` object becomes available\n- In UXP: There is no equivalent mechanism; UXP uses its own API via `require('premierepro')`\n\n**Source:** [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Has anyone successfully used QE DOM from a UXP plugin?\n\n**NO documented cases found.** My search across GitHub, Adobe forums, Stack Overflow, and developer blogs found no examples of QE DOM being accessed from UXP. All QE DOM usage examples are in ExtendScript/CEP contexts.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Adobe Forum Discussions about QE + UXP\n\nBruce Bullis (Adobe Employee) stated on Adobe forums:\n\n> \"There have been zero changes to QE DOM APIs, and no such changes are planned or scheduled. Of course, the QE DOM will also remain 100% unsupported, and not at all recommended.\"\n\n> \"The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin, the right starting point for any future integrations, shows how to clone and remove track items.\"\n\nKey points from forum discussions:\n- Adobe recommends UXP for all new development\n- No mention of QE DOM being ported to UXP\n- QE functionality gaps should be addressed through UXP API feature requests\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Adobe Community - Request for Timeline Editing API Support](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115)\n- [Adobe Community - To UXP or not to UXP](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-extensions-to-uxp-or-not-to-uxp/td-p/11326933)\n\n---\n\n### 5. GitHub Repos Attempting QE Access from UXP\n\n**None found.** All repositories using QE DOM are ExtendScript/CEP-based:\n- [Adobe-CEP/Samples/PProPanel](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx) - Uses QE in ExtendScript\n- [AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples) - Pure UXP, no QE usage\n- [amirul181/Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Quality-Engineering-QE-Unofficial-Documentation](https://github.com/amirul181/Adobe-Premiere-Pro-Quality-Engineering-QE-Unofficial-Documentation) - ExtendScript only\n\n---\n\n### 6. Will QE DOM Continue to Exist After September 2026?\n\n**Uncertain, but likely YES (with ExtendScript support ending).**\n\n- ExtendScript-based integrations are \"still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026\"\n- After September 2026, CEP/ExtendScript support will be removed\n- QE DOM is tied to ExtendScript, so **QE DOM access will likely cease when ExtendScript is removed**\n- Adobe has stated: \"No further changes or improvements to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled\"\n\n**Source:** [Adobe Developer - Premiere and UXP](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/)\n\n---\n\n### 7. Is QE DOM Part of ExtendScript or Separate?\n\n**QE DOM is accessed through ExtendScript but is technically a separate internal Adobe API layer.**\n\n- QE DOM was \"built for internal testing and automation\" by Adobe\n- It is accessed via ExtendScript by calling `app.enableQE()`\n- It is NOT part of the official ExtendScript DOM - it's an undocumented layer\n- However, it REQUIRES ExtendScript to access it - there is no other interface\n\n**Source:** [Vakago Tools - Understanding the Adobe Premiere Pro QE API](https://vakago-tools.com/premiere-pro-qe-api/)\n\n---\n\n### 8. Adobe Statements About QE DOM's Future\n\nBruce Bullis (Adobe):\n\n> \"No additional work is planned on the unsupported, undocumented PPro ExtendScript QE DOM.\"\n\n> \"The QE DOM will also remain 100% unsupported, and not at all recommended.\"\n\n> \"The QE DOM has some issues updating itself, in response to user interaction.\"\n\nThere are **no statements suggesting QE DOM will be ported to UXP** or receive any updates.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Adobe Community Forums](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-extensions-to-uxp-or-not-to-uxp/td-p/11326933)\n- [Adobe Community - Timeline Editing API Request](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115)\n\n---\n\n### 9. Alternative Ways to Access QE Functionality\n\n**Within UXP:**\n- Adobe is working toward \"1:1 parity\" with ExtendScript DOM (not QE DOM)\n- UXP can apply effects (previously QE-only)\n- UXP can make Undo groupings\n- UXP can clone and remove track items\n\n**Still missing in UXP (was in QE):**\n- Moving clips between tracks\n- Source-target patches control\n- Timeline zoom/view control\n- Some effect application methods\n\n**Workaround (until Sept 2026):** Run a CEP panel alongside your UXP plugin - CEP can still access QE DOM via ExtendScript.\n\n**Source:** [Adobe Community - Full UXP support ETA](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/full-uxp-support-eta/td-p/15352929)\n\n---\n\n### 10. Bridges or Workarounds to Call QE from UXP\n\n**NO direct bridges exist.**\n\n- UXP does NOT support `evalScript()` to call ExtendScript\n- UXP has \"1 unified environment\" - no ExtendScript bridge\n- CEP's `CSInterface.evalScript()` has no UXP equivalent\n\n**Potential workarounds (not officially supported):**\n1. **External process communication:** Use websockets or local HTTP server to communicate between a UXP plugin and a separate CEP panel or script runner\n2. **Hybrid approach:** Run both a CEP panel (for QE access) and UXP plugin simultaneously\n3. **Feature requests:** Request specific QE functionality be added to UXP API\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Hyper Brew - Scripts vs Extensions vs Plugins](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/scripts-extensions-plugins/)\n- [Adobe Developer - UXP APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/)\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Question | Answer |\n|----------|--------|\n| `app.enableQE()` in UXP? | NO |\n| `qe` global in UXP? | NO |\n| Successful UXP + QE examples? | NONE FOUND |\n| QE after Sept 2026? | LIKELY NO (dies with ExtendScript) |\n| QE part of ExtendScript? | Accessed via ExtendScript, but separate layer |\n| QE future updates? | NO updates planned |\n| QE porting to UXP? | NO indication |\n| Direct UXP-QE bridge? | DOES NOT EXIST |\n\n---\n\n## Key Timelines\n\n- **December 2024:** UXP for Premiere Pro entered public beta\n- **November 2025:** Premiere Pro 25.6 released with full UXP support\n- **September 2026:** ExtendScript/CEP support planned to end\n- **Post-Sept 2026:** QE DOM will likely be inaccessible (no ExtendScript = no QE access)\n\n---\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Do not rely on QE DOM for new UXP plugins** - it is inaccessible\n2. **File feature requests** for specific QE functionality you need in UXP\n3. **If QE is essential**, continue using CEP until September 2026\n4. **Monitor UXP API updates** - Adobe is actively adding functionality\n5. **Plan migration** away from QE-dependent features before September 2026\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Adobe Developer - Premiere UXP API](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Adobe Developer - Premiere and UXP Introduction](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/)\n- [Adobe Community - To UXP or not to UXP](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-extensions-to-uxp-or-not-to-uxp/td-p/11326933)\n- [Adobe Community - Timeline Editing API Request](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115)\n- [Adobe Community - Full UXP Support ETA](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/full-uxp-support-eta/td-p/15352929)\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [Hyper Brew - Premiere Pro UXP Beta](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/)\n- [Hyper Brew - Scripts vs Extensions vs Plugins](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/scripts-extensions-plugins/)\n- [Vakago Tools - Understanding the Adobe Premiere Pro QE API](https://vakago-tools.com/premiere-pro-qe-api/)\n- [GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [GitHub - Adobe-CEP/Samples PProPanel](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx)\n- [Adobe Tech Blog - UXP Arrives in Premiere](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2581,"cache_read_input_tokens":31528,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2581,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGhMUPwTEHsZajWvkQK3","type":"assistant","uuid":"1ea1923c-2cad-4b52-a3a6-594a726a2426","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:44:21.145Z"}
