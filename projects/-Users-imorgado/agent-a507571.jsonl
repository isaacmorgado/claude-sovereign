As of Premiere Pro 25.6, CEP extensions have been superseded by UXP Extensibility.(no content)If you are starting new development, Adobe recommends starting in UXP. CEP extensions continue to be supported, with the plan being to support both CEP and UXP for a calendar year, after which they will remove support for CEP extensibility.\n\n### CEP and ExtendScript Basics\n\nCEP consists of Chromium instances which load JavaScript-based web pages. CEP uses the CSInterface to send ExtendScript to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript (ES3) interpreter.(no content)In order for CEP Extensions to get information or send commands to the host application, such as Premiere Pro, they must call functions in the ExtendScript layer. ExtendScript is Adobe's custom flavor of JavaScript based on the older ES3 version (released in 1999).\n\n### Context Menu / Flyout Menu Support\n\nFor fly-out menus on the native panel of HTML extensions, this has been supported. Two new interfaces were added to CSInterface.(no content)The \"menu\" parameter for `setPanelFlyoutMenu` is an XML string.

As of Premiere Pro 25.6, CEP extensions have been superseded by UXP Extensibility.(no content)If you are starting new development, Adobe recommends starting in UXP. CEP extensions continue to be supported, with the plan being to support both CEP and UXP for a calendar year, after which they will remove support for CEP extensibility.\n\n### CEP and ExtendScript Basics\n\nCEP consists of Chromium instances which load JavaScript-based web pages. CEP uses the CSInterface to send ExtendScript to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript (ES3) interpreter.(no content)In order for CEP Extensions to get information or send commands to the host application, such as Premiere Pro, they must call functions in the ExtendScript layer. ExtendScript is Adobe's custom flavor of JavaScript based on the older ES3 version (released in 1999).\n\n### Context Menu / Flyout Menu Support\n\nFor fly-out menus on the native panel of HTML extensions, this has been supported. Two new interfaces were added to CSInterface.(no content)The \"menu\" parameter for `setPanelFlyoutMenu` is an XML string. If users want to be notified when clicking a menu item, they need to register the `com.adobe.csxs.events.flyoutMenuClicked` event by calling `addEventListener`. When a menu item is clicked, the event callback function will be called, and the `data` attribute of the event is an object containing `menuId` and `menuName` attributes.\n\n### Development Resources\n\nThe PProPanel sample project is exhaustive in its exercise of Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API.(no content)Microsoft Visual Studio Code and the ExtendScript debugging extension is Adobe's recommended ExtendScript development environment, replacing the older ExtendScript Toolkit.(no content)As Adobe works toward providing UXP-based extensibility, they've stopped additional work on the ExtendScript API.\n\n### UXP Migration Resources\n\nUXP samples are available at: https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples/tree/main and documentation at: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/\n\nNote: The search results did not return specific information about implementing right-click context menus within a CEP panel (as opposed to the flyout menu). If you need native right-click context menu functionality within your panel, you may need to implement custom HTML/JavaScript context menus, as CEP panels run in a Chromium environment."],"durationSeconds":23.0636890420001}}

Anything returned from the 'vanilla' DOM (like the trackItems returned by `app.project.activeSequence.getSelection()`), should be presumed to be incompatible with the QE DOM.(no content)No further changes to ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled; Adobe is now focused on getting UXP extensibility to 1:1 parity with what's possible via CEP+ExtendScript.\n\n### Practical Example: Nesting a Selection\n\nThe first step is to get the active sequence in the project using `app.project.activeSequence`.

In addition to core metadata such as the plugin's name, version, icons, and entry points, the manifest specifies permissions, compatibility details, and other definitions that shape how the plugin integrates with the host environment. Most importantly, it contains your plugin ID, which uniquely identifies your plugin when it's installed in the host application.(no content)Premiere supports manifest version \"5\".\n\n## Command Entrypoints\n\nCommand entrypoints are the most common type of entrypoint. They allow you to add commands to the Premiere Pro user interface. When the user runs a command, your plugin can perform a variety of actions, such as opening a dialog and changing the document.\n\n### Registering Commands in the Manifest\n\nIn your manifest.json file, register a new command-type entrypoint with a structure like `{ \"type\": \"command\", \"id\": \"myCommand\", \"label\": \"My Command\" }`. This will add a new command entrypoint with the ID \"myCommand\" to your plugin, and it will show up as \"My Command\" in the Premiere Pro user interface.\n\n### Setting Up Command Handlers in JavaScript\n\nThere are two ways to add a command entrypoint to your plugin's code. In your JavaScript code (for example, in your index.js), add code using `const { entrypoints } = require(\"uxp\"); entrypoints.setup({ commands: { myCommand: myCommandHandler } });\n\n## Menu Location\n\nAll Commands and Panels from the same plugin appear under that plugin's submenu in Window > UXP Plugins. Commands are menu items that execute code when clicked. They appear in the Window > UXP Plugins menu and are designed for discrete tasks that don't require a persistent interface.\n\n## Commands vs Panels\n\nThink of it this way: Commands are actions, while Panels are workspaces. Commands execute tasks and close; Panels provide ongoing interfaces that stay open alongside Premiere's built-in panels.(no content)Commands execute discrete tasks with optional modal dialogs—perfect for automation and one-time actions. Panels provide persistent, dockable interfaces for ongoing interaction and complex workflows.\n\n## Keyboard Shortcuts\n\nKeyboard shortcuts are not available in Premiere yet.\n\n## Auto-Start Plugins\n\nWith the current state of UXP in Premiere Pro, invisible auto-start plugins are possible in Premiere Pro Beta 25.4 by adding `loadEvent: \"startup\"` to the manifest host object's data section.\n\n## Lifecycle Hooks\n\nLifecycle hooks are callback functions that automatically execute during specific plugin and panel events, enabling setup and teardown logic for UXP plugins in Adobe Premiere. Plugin-level hooks include create() and destroy() triggered when the plugin container is created/destroyed. Panel-level hooks include create(), show(), hide(), and destroy() triggered during panel lifecycle events.\n\n## Current Status\n\nAs of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"cae0b768-2e36-4ede-8db7-39013796849a","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:58:08.975Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"UXP Premiere Pro entrypoints commands menu manifest 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0153aPCwnBRy1EP53DUjM5Sx","content":[{"title":"UXP Manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Adding command entrypoints to your plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/tutorials/adding-command-entrypoints/"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"Manifest File Structure - UXP Manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/"},{"title":"require('uxp').entrypoints","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/uxp/reference-js/Modules/uxp/Entry%20Points/EntryPoints/"},{"title":"Panels and Commands","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/panels-and-commands/"},{"title":"Invisible Auto-Start UXP Plugins for Premiere Pro - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/invisible-auto-start-uxp-plugins-for-premiere-pro/10835"},{"title":"Plugin Lifecycle Hooks","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/tutorials/add-lifecycle-hooks/"},{"title":"Uxp menu items and entrypoints - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-menu-items-and-entrypoints/5697"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about UXP Premiere Pro entrypoints, commands, menu, and manifest:\n\n## UXP Manifest for Premiere Pro\n\nEach UXP plugin must have one manifest.json file that the host application uses to load and manage the plugin.

Panel-level hooks include create(), show(), hide(), and destroy() triggered during panel lifecycle events.\n\n## Current Status\n\nAs of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins."],"durationSeconds":22.466103083000053}}

It can be docked, participates in workspaces, has fly-out menus, and is re-opened at start-up if open at shutdown.\n\n### The `setPanelFlyoutMenu` Method\n\nThe function is defined as:\n```javascript\nCSInterface.prototype.setPanelFlyoutMenu = function(menu){\n    window.__adobe_cep__.invokeSync(\"setPanelFlyoutMenu\", menu);\n};\n```\nThe \"menu\" parameter for setPanelFlyoutMenu is a XML string.\n\n### XML Structure Example\n\nHere's an example of the XML structure:\n```xml\n<Menu>\n    <MenuItem Id=\"menuItemId1\" Label=\"TestExample1\" Enabled=\"true\" Checked=\"false\"/>\n    <MenuItem Label=\"TestExample2\">\n        <MenuItem Label=\"TestExample2-1\">\n            <MenuItem Label=\"TestExample2-1-1\" Enabled=\"false\" Checked=\"true\"/>\n        </MenuItem>\n        <MenuItem Label=\"TestExample2-2\" Enabled=\"true\" Checked=\"true\"/>\n    </MenuItem>\n    <MenuItem Label=\"---\" />\n    <MenuItem Label=\"TestExample3\" Enabled=\"false\" Checked=\"false\"/>\n</Menu>\n```\n\n### Setting Up the Menu and Event Listener\n\nYou build the menu by feeding `setPanelFlyoutMenu` with the XML string:\n```javascript\n// Uses the XML string to build the menu\ncsInterface.setPanelFlyoutMenu(flyoutXML);\n```\nAn event listener has been added to respond to clicks (the event is \"com.adobe.csxs.events.flyoutMenuClicked\"):\n```javascript\ncsInterface.addEventListener(\"com.adobe.csxs.events.flyoutMenuClicked\", flyoutMenuClickedHandler);\n```(no content)When a click occurs, an event is passed to the callback. Its `data` attribute is an object containing both `menuId` and `menuName`.\n\n### Updating Menu Items\n\nYou can update menu items dynamically:\n```javascript\nCSInterface.prototype.updatePanelMenuItem = function(menuItemLabel, enabled, checked){\n    var ret = false;\n    if (this.getHostCapabilities().EXTENDED_PANEL_MENU){\n        var itemStatus = new MenuItemStatus(menuItemLabel, enabled, checked);\n        ret = window.__adobe_cep__.invokeSync(\"updatePanelMenuItem\", JSON.stringify(itemStatus));\n    }\n    return ret;\n};\n```\n\n### Premiere Pro Specific Resources\n\nAdobe provides official samples that showcase \"most features and capabilities of CEP 6, including events, video, database interaction via Node, native APIs, ExternalObject, HTML FlyOut menus and lots of other good stuff!\"(no content)The CEP Test Panel shows the full capabilities of CEP panels.

The PProPanel sample project is exhaustive in its exercise of Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API.\n\nThe main PProPanel sample is available at:\n- https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel\n- https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/index.html\n\n### CEP Flyout Menu Setup\n\nWith Photoshop CC 2014.2 (implementing CEP 5.2) it's finally possible to have flyout menus in HTML Panels too - as we had back in Flash land. This Tip shows you how to set them and deal with their click handler.\n\nTo set up a flyout menu, you use the `setPanelFlyoutMenu()` method with XML:\nThe code uses `csInterface.setPanelFlyoutMenu(flyoutXML)` to build the menu from an XML string.\n\n### Updating Menu Items\n\nThe `updatePanelMenuItem` function \"Updates a menu item in the extension window's flyout menu, by setting the enabled and selection status. Since 5.2.0.\" It takes a `menuItemLabel` parameter and an `enabled` parameter where \"True to enable the item, false to disable it (gray it out).\"(no content)The function also accepts a `checked` parameter where \"True to select the item, false to deselect it.\" It returns \"false when the host application does not support this functionality (HostCapabilities.EXTENDED_PANEL_MENU is false).

This Tip shows you how to set them and deal with their click handler.\n\nTo set up a flyout menu, you use the `setPanelFlyoutMenu()` method with XML:\nThe code uses `csInterface.setPanelFlyoutMenu(flyoutXML)` to build the menu from an XML string.\n\n### Updating Menu Items\n\nThe `updatePanelMenuItem` function \"Updates a menu item in the extension window's flyout menu, by setting the enabled and selection status. Since 5.2.0.\" It takes a `menuItemLabel` parameter and an `enabled` parameter where \"True to enable the item, false to disable it (gray it out).\"(no content)The function also accepts a `checked` parameter where \"True to select the item, false to deselect it.\" It returns \"false when the host application does not support this functionality (HostCapabilities.EXTENDED_PANEL_MENU is false).

This is a hard limitation of the platform.\n\n**The good news:** There are several viable alternative approaches that can achieve similar workflows, and I have detailed implementation guidance for each.\n\n---\n\n## 1. CEP/ExtendScript Context Menu Support\n\n### Can CEP plugins add items to Premiere's native right-click context menu?\n\n**No.** This is explicitly confirmed in Adobe community discussions:\n\n> \"Script-based commands cannot be added to context menus in Premiere Pro. PPro's context menus are not externally customizable.\"\n> -- [Adobe Community Discussion](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/can-i-customize-the-right-click-menu/td-p/12346592)\n\n### What Context Menu APIs ARE Available?\n\nCEP panels support two types of menus:\n\n#### A. Panel Flyout Menu (hamburger menu in panel header)\n```javascript\n// XML menu definition\nvar flyoutXML = '<Menu>' +\n    '<MenuItem Id=\"spliceVoice\" Label=\"SPLICE: Process with Voice Isolation\" Enabled=\"true\" Checked=\"false\"/>' +\n    '<MenuItem Id=\"spliceNoVoice\" Label=\"SPLICE: Process without Voice Isolation\" Enabled=\"true\" Checked=\"false\"/>' +\n    '<MenuItem Label=\"---\" />' +\n    '<MenuItem Id=\"settings\" Label=\"Settings...\" Enabled=\"true\" Checked=\"false\"/>' +\n'</Menu>';\n\n// Set the flyout menu\ncsInterface.setPanelFlyoutMenu(flyoutXML);\n\n// Listen for menu clicks\ncsInterface.addEventListener(\"com.adobe.csxs.events.flyoutMenuClicked\", function(event) {\n    var menuId = event.data.menuId;\n    if (menuId === \"spliceVoice\") {\n        processSelectedClips(true); // with voice isolation\n    } else if (menuId === \"spliceNoVoice\") {\n        processSelectedClips(false); // without voice isolation\n    }\n});\n```\n\n#### B. Context Menu WITHIN Your Panel (right-click inside your panel's HTML)\n```javascript\n// Context menu within your CEP panel\nvar contextMenuXML = '<Menu>' +\n    '<MenuItem Id=\"spliceVoice\" Label=\"SPLICE: Process with Voice Isolation\" Enabled=\"true\" Icon=\"./icons/voice.png\"/>' +\n    '<MenuItem Id=\"spliceNoVoice\" Label=\"SPLICE: Process without Voice Isolation\" Enabled=\"true\" Icon=\"./icons/no-voice.png\"/>' +\n'</Menu>';\n\ncsInterface.setContextMenu(contextMenuXML, function(menuId) {\n    if (menuId === \"spliceVoice\") {\n        processSelectedClips(true);\n    } else if (menuId === \"spliceNoVoice\") {\n        processSelectedClips(false);\n    }\n});\n\ncsInterface.addEventListener(\"com.adobe.csxs.events.contextMenuClicked\", menuClickHandler);\n```\n\n**Limitation:** This context menu only appears when right-clicking inside your panel's HTML area, not on the timeline.\n\nSources:\n- [CEP 11.1 HTML Extension Cookbook](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_11.x/Documentation/CEP%2011.1%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md)\n- [HTML Panels Tips: #14 Flyout Menu](https://www.davidebarranca.com/2014/10/html-panels-tips-14-flyout-menu/)\n\n---\n\n## 2. UXP Context Menu Support\n\n### Does UXP for Premiere support context menus on the timeline?\n\n**No.** UXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) in Premiere Pro also does not provide access to native timeline context menus. UXP provides:\n\n1. **Command entrypoints** - Menu items under `Window > UXP Plugins > [Your Plugin]`\n2. **Panel entrypoints** - Dockable panels with custom UI\n\n### UXP Command Implementation\n\n```json\n// manifest.json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"com.yourcompany.splice\",\n  \"name\": \"SPLICE Audio Processing\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"PremierePro\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"25.6\"\n  },\n  \"entrypoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"command\",\n      \"id\": \"processWithVoiceIsolation\",\n      \"label\": \"SPLICE: Process with Voice Isolation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"command\", \n      \"id\": \"processWithoutVoiceIsolation\",\n      \"label\": \"SPLICE: Process without Voice Isolation\"\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"splicePanel\",\n      \"label\": \"SPLICE Panel\"\n    }\n  ]\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\n// index.js\nconst { entrypoints } = require(\"uxp\");\n\nentrypoints.setup({\n  commands: {\n    processWithVoiceIsolation: async () => {\n      await processSelectedClips(true);\n    },\n    processWithoutVoiceIsolation: async () => {\n      await processSelectedClips(false);\n    }\n  }\n});\n```\n\n**Location:** These commands appear under `Window > UXP Plugins > SPLICE Audio Processing`\n\n**Note:** Keyboard shortcuts are not yet available in UXP for Premiere Pro.\n\nSources:\n- [Adding command entrypoints to your plugin](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/tutorials/adding-command-entrypoints/)\n- [UXP Manifest](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/)\n- [Panels and Commands](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/panels-and-commands/)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Alternative Approaches (Recommended)\n\n### Option A: Panel with Selection Detection (BEST APPROACH)\n\nCreate a dockable panel that shows selected clips and provides action buttons.\n\n```javascript\n// ExtendScript (Premiere.jsx)\n$._PPP_ = {\n    getSelectedClipsInfo: function() {\n        var selection = app.project.activeSequence.getSelection();\n        var clipInfo = [];\n        \n        for (var i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) {\n            var clip = selection[i];\n            clipInfo.push({\n                name: clip.name,\n                start: clip.start.seconds,\n                end: clip.end.seconds,\n                duration: clip.duration.seconds,\n                trackIndex: clip.parentTrackIndex,\n                mediaType: clip.mediaType\n            });\n        }\n        return JSON.stringify(clipInfo);\n    },\n    \n    processClipsWithVoiceIsolation: function(voiceIsolation) {\n        var selection = app.project.activeSequence.getSelection();\n        if (selection.length === 0) {\n            return JSON.stringify({error: \"No clips selected\"});\n        }\n        \n        // Your processing logic here\n        var result = {\n            clipCount: selection.length,\n            voiceIsolation: voiceIsolation,\n            status: \"processing\"\n        };\n        \n        return JSON.stringify(result);\n    }\n};\n\n// Register for selection change events\napp.bind(\"onActiveSequenceSelectionChanged\", function() {\n    // Send event to CEP panel via Vulcan messaging\n    var eventObj = new CSXSEvent();\n    eventObj.type = \"com.splice.selectionChanged\";\n    eventObj.data = $._PPP_.getSelectedClipsInfo();\n    eventObj.dispatch();\n});\n```\n\n```html\n<!-- Panel HTML (index.html) -->\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>SPLICE Audio Processing</title>\n    <script src=\"js/CSInterface.js\"></script>\n    <style>\n        body { \n            font-family: Adobe Clean, sans-serif;

// Voice isolation\n    }\n    if (e.ctrlKey && e.shiftKey && e.key === \"N\") {\n        e.preventDefault();\n        processClips(false); // No voice isolation\n    }\n});\n```\n\n**Limitation:** Keyboard shortcuts only work when your panel has focus.\n\nSources:\n- [How To: Assign Keyboard Shortcuts to ExtendScript](https://vakago-tools.com/assign-hotkeys-to-extendscript-in-adobe-applications/)\n\n### Option C: Menu Bar Integration via UXP Commands\n\nAs shown in Section 2, UXP commands appear under `Window > UXP Plugins`. This is the closest to native menu integration available.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Implementation Methods - Selection APIs\n\n### ExtendScript Selection API\n\n```javascript\n// Get selected clips\nvar selection = app.project.activeSequence.getSelection();\n\n// Returns TrackItemCollection (array-like)\n// Each item is a TrackItem object with properties:\n// - name: string\n// - start: Time object\n// - end: Time object  \n// - duration: Time object\n// - inPoint: Time object\n// - outPoint: Time object\n// - mediaType: string (\"Video\", \"Audio\")\n// - parentTrackIndex: number\n// - components: ComponentCollection (effects)\n// - projectItem: ProjectItem (source media)\n\n// Check if items are selected\nif (selection.length > 0) {\n    for (var i = 0; i < selection.length; i++) {\n        var clip = selection[i];\n        // Process each clip\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Selection Change Event\n\n```javascript\n// Register for selection change events\napp.bind(\"onActiveSequenceSelectionChanged\", function() {\n    var selection = app.project.activeSequence.getSelection();\n    // Handle the new selection\n});\n\n// Other useful events\napp.bind(\"onActiveSequenceChanged\", function() {\n    // Different sequence became active\n});\n\napp.bind(\"onActiveSequenceStructureChanged\", function() {\n    // Clips were added/removed/moved\n});\n```\n\nSources:\n- [Sequence object - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/sequence/sequence/)\n- [Adobe Community - Selected clip in timeline?](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/selected-clip-in-timeline/td-p/8233928)\n\n---\n\n## 5. QE (Undocumented) API\n\nThe QE API is an undocumented API that provides additional functionality. To check if it has context menu capabilities:\n\n```javascript\n// Enable QE API\napp.enableQE();\n\n// Explore available methods\nvar methods = qe.reflect.methods;\n\n// Known useful QE methods:\n// qe.project.getActiveSequence()\n// qe.project.undo()\n// qe.project.getVideoEffectList()\n// QETrackItem.addVideoEffect()\n// qe.project.getActiveSequence().exportFramePNG()\n```\n\n**Important:** The QE API is undocumented and unsupported. Objects from the standard DOM (like `getSelection()` results) are incompatible with QE DOM objects.\n\nSources:\n- [Understanding the Adobe Premiere Pro QE API](https://vakago-tools.com/premiere-pro-qe-api/)\n- [Unofficial Premiere Pro CC API](https://vidjuheffex.github.io/ppro.api/)\n\n---\n\n## 6.

Summary and Recommendations\n\n| Approach | Native Feel | Implementation Effort | Stability |\n|----------|-------------|----------------------|-----------|\n| Panel with Buttons | Medium | Low | High |\n| Panel Flyout Menu | High | Low | High |\n| UXP Commands | High | Medium | Medium |\n| Keyboard Shortcuts | Low | Low | Medium |\n\n### Best Practice Recommendation\n\n1. **Primary Interface:** Create a CEP panel with prominent buttons for your two processing options\n2. **Secondary Interface:** Add a panel flyout menu with the same options\n3. **Selection Feedback:** Display selected clip count and names in the panel\n4. **Progress Indicator:** Show processing progress in the panel\n5. **Future-Proofing:** Plan for UXP migration as CEP support ends ~September 2026\n\n### Sample Repository References\n\n- [PProPanel Sample (Adobe-CEP/Samples)](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro Samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Adobe CEP Getting Started Guides](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides)\n- [Adobe CEP Samples Repository](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples)\n- [PProPanel Sample](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/ReadMe.md)\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [The Premiere UXP API](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [UXP Manifest Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/)\n- [Adding command entrypoints](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/tutorials/adding-command-entrypoints/)\n- [CEP 11.1 HTML Extension Cookbook](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_11.x/Documentation/CEP%2011.1%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md)\n- [Understanding the Adobe Premiere Pro QE API](https://vakago-tools.com/premiere-pro-qe-api/)\n- [Adobe Community - Context Menu Customization](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/can-i-customize-the-right-click-menu/td-p/12346592)\n- [Adobe Community - Selection Change Events](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/an-event-for-timeline-selection-change-in-cep/td-p/10898752)\n- [Adobe Community - Selected clip in timeline](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/selected-clip-in-timeline/td-p/8233928)\n- [Develop Your First Premiere Pro Extension](https://vakago-tools.com/develop-your-first-premiere-pro-extension-a-step-by-step-guide/)\n- [ExtendScript Hotkey Manager](https://vakago-tools.com/assign-hotkeys-to-extendscript-in-adobe-applications/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2853,"cache_read_input_tokens":34308,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2853,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":5641,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWAj2sEnzeBgMKbZuHHWz","type":"assistant","uuid":"b55bcff2-9393-454b-bd71-e3623e2a6487","timestamp":"2025-12-16T17:03:13.690Z"}
