At that point the mesh starts to deform around the forehead and nose, departing from the head. The visible eye's contour becomes as if the eye is upfront and there is also bad fit of the chin landmarks.(no content)If you feed just side images to the code, no landmarks are returned at all.\n\n### General Limitations\n\nThe 3D landmark predictions can still degrade at extreme angles (e.g., full profile), as key points like the eyes and nose become occluded.(no content)Landmark regression depends on the face detector to find faces. If the face detector fails (e.g., extreme pose, occlusion, blur), no landmarks will be predicted.\n\n### Model Architecture Context\n\nMediaPipe Face Mesh is a solution that estimates 468 3D face landmarks in real-time even on mobile devices. It employs machine learning (ML) to infer the 3D facial surface, requiring only a single camera input without the need for a dedicated depth sensor.(no content)The 3D landmark network receives as input a cropped video frame without additional depth input. The model outputs the positions of the 3D points, as well as the probability of a face being present and reasonably aligned in the input.\n\n### Precision Concerns\n\nThe predicted landmark coordinates are not pixel-perfect and can \"drift\" across frames. Post-processing is often required for fine-grained analysis.(no content)The model is designed for real-time applications, which means it's not suitable for tasks that require more processing power or accuracy. If you need to analyze facial landmarks in more detail, you might need to use a different model.\n\nIn summary, MediaPipe Face Mesh has significant limitations with profile/side views - the face detector may fail entirely for full profile shots, and even partial side views can cause mesh deformation around the forehead, nose, and eye contours.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"fde61801-fe08-4878-b334-5f07c0e355fc","timestamp":"2025-12-20T01:56:37.770Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"MediaPipe face mesh profile view accuracy limitations side view landmarks","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01K8Q2u49RVCyyqT2awPvseJ","content":[{"title":"layout: forward target: https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker/ title: Face Mesh parent: MediaPipe Legacy Solutions nav_order: 2 — MediaPipe v0.7.5 documentation","url":"https://mediapipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/solutions/face_mesh.html"},{"title":"Using side-view to infer face mesh landmark depth coordinate? · Issue #3510 · google-ai-edge/mediapipe","url":"https://github.com/google/mediapipe/issues/3510"},{"title":"mediapipe/docs/solutions/face_mesh.md at master · google-ai-edge/mediapipe","url":"https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe/blob/master/docs/solutions/face_mesh.md"},{"title":"Face Mesh - mediapipe","url":"https://chuoling.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh.html"},{"title":"Face landmark detection guide | MediaPipe | Google for Developers","url":"https://developers.google.com/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker"},{"title":"MediaPipe Face Mesh · Models · Dataloop","url":"https://dataloop.ai/library/model/mediapipe_face-mesh/"},{"title":"Mediapipe landmark face/hand/pose sequence number list view | by Hotaru Komajou | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@hotakoma/mediapipe-landmark-face-hand-pose-sequence-number-list-view-778364d6c414"},{"title":"MediaPipe Face Mesh","url":"https://github.com/google-ai-edge/mediapipe/wiki/MediaPipe-Face-Mesh"},{"title":"Facial Landmarks Detection with MediaPipe Face Mesh: A Deep Dive - 33rd Square","url":"https://www.33rdsquare.com/facial-landmarks-detection-using-mediapipe-library/"},{"title":"Face landmark detection guide | Google AI Edge | Google AI for Developers","url":"https://ai.google.dev/edge/mediapipe/solutions/vision/face_landmarker"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about MediaPipe Face Mesh profile view accuracy and limitations:\n\n## MediaPipe Face Mesh Profile/Side View Limitations\n\n### Key Issues with Profile Views\n\nWhen using MediaPipe FaceMesh, the mesh looks great until the head turns so much that only one eye becomes visible.

This dataset is typically used for evaluation of 3D facial landmark detection models.(no content)AFLW2000-3D is a dataset constructed by re-annotating the first 2000 images from AFLW using 68 3D landmarks in a consistent manner with the ones from 300W-LP-3D.(no content)The head poses are very diverse and often hard to be detected by a CNN-based face detector.\n\n## Benchmark Usage and Normalized Mean Error (NME)\n\nThe AFLW2000-3D dataset consists of 2000 meticulously annotated images, each equipped with a comprehensive set of 68-point 3D facial landmarks at the image level. Due to its inherently demanding characteristics and the richness of its annotations, the AFLW2000-3D dataset has emerged as a dynamic benchmark for the evaluation of accuracy and robustness for facial landmark detection.

This dataset is typically used for evaluation of 3D facial landmark detection models.(no content)AFLW2000-3D is a dataset constructed by re-annotating the first 2000 images from AFLW using 68 3D landmarks in a consistent manner with the ones from 300W-LP-3D.(no content)The head poses are very diverse and often hard to be detected by a CNN-based face detector.\n\n## Benchmark Usage and Normalized Mean Error (NME)\n\nThe AFLW2000-3D dataset consists of 2000 meticulously annotated images, each equipped with a comprehensive set of 68-point 3D facial landmarks at the image level. Due to its inherently demanding characteristics and the richness of its annotations, the AFLW2000-3D dataset has emerged as a dynamic benchmark for the evaluation of accuracy and robustness for facial landmark detection.

The most common error metric is to take the normalised mean error (NME). One can normalise the error between the detection and the ground truth either by the inter ocular distance or based on the face box size.(no content)\"The average point-to-point Euclidean error normalized by the inter-ocular distance (measured as the Euclidean distance between the outer corners of the eyes)\"\n\n### Profile vs Frontal Comparison Challenges\n\nUsing the IOD as normaliser has the characteristic of normalising large yaw poses by a smaller factor as frontal poses.

The most common error metric is to take the normalised mean error (NME). One can normalise the error between the detection and the ground truth either by the inter ocular distance or based on the face box size.(no content)\"The average point-to-point Euclidean error normalized by the inter-ocular distance (measured as the Euclidean distance between the outer corners of the eyes)\"\n\n### Profile vs Frontal Comparison Challenges\n\nUsing the IOD as normaliser has the characteristic of normalising large yaw poses by a smaller factor as frontal poses. Thus errors on pose images are higher than on frontal pose images.(no content)For the profile Menpo datasets where the corners of both eyes were not present, the diagonal length of the face as defined by the distance between landmarks 10 and 13 was used as the normalising factor.\n\n### Dataset Considerations\n\nMenpo-2D is a collection of frontal and profile faces.

An image is split into smaller fixed-sized patches which are treated as a sequence of tokens, similar to words for NLP tasks.\n\n### Face Recognition Challenges with Non-Frontal Views\nRecent face recognition algorithms can achieve high accuracy when the tested face samples are frontal. However, when the face pose changes largely, the performance of existing methods drop drastically.(no content)Personal identification systems that use face recognition work well for test images with frontal view face, but often fail when the input face is a pose view. Most face databases come from picture ID sources such as passports or driver's licenses.\n\n### Vision Transformers for Face Recognition\nMost of the existing face recognition applications using deep learning models have leveraged CNN-based architectures as the feature extractor.

An image is split into smaller fixed-sized patches which are treated as a sequence of tokens, similar to words for NLP tasks.\n\n### Face Recognition Challenges with Non-Frontal Views\nRecent face recognition algorithms can achieve high accuracy when the tested face samples are frontal. However, when the face pose changes largely, the performance of existing methods drop drastically.(no content)Personal identification systems that use face recognition work well for test images with frontal view face, but often fail when the input face is a pose view. Most face databases come from picture ID sources such as passports or driver's licenses.\n\n### Vision Transformers for Face Recognition\nMost of the existing face recognition applications using deep learning models have leveraged CNN-based architectures as the feature extractor. However, recent studies have shown that in computer vision tasks, vision transformer-based models often outperform CNN-based models. Therefore, S-ViT (Sparse Vision Transformer) was proposed based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture to improve face recognition tasks.\n\n### Face Alignment and Profile Views in Emotion Recognition\nA notable drawback of the most existing methods is that they consider only the frontal images (i.e., ignore profile views for convenience), although the profile views taken from different angles are important for a practical FER system.(no content)The selection of image color space and the use of facial alignment as preprocessing steps may collectively pose a significant impact on the accuracy and computational cost of facial emotion recognition, which is crucial to optimize the speed-accuracy trade-off.\n\n### Self-Attention in ViT for Alignment\nThe self-attention mechanism allows the model to give more importance to the relevant input features, which helps it capture more informative representations of the input data.
