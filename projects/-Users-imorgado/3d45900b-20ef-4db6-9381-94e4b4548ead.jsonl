Here's what I learned:\n\n## Overview\n\nRoo Code is an open-source, AI-powered coding assistant that runs in VS Code.(no content)It goes beyond simple autocompletion by reading and writing across multiple files, executing commands, and adapting to your workflow—like having a whole dev team right inside your editor.\n\n## Key Features and Capabilities\n\n**Multi-File Editing:**\nIt's built for multi-file edits, so it can read, refactor, and update multiple files at once for holistic code changes.\n\n**Agentic Abilities:**\nIts agentic abilities go beyond a typical AI autocomplete, enabling it to run tests, open a browser, and handle deeper tasks.(no content)Roo Code demonstrates high autonomy through its ability to execute terminal commands, automate browser actions, edit files directly in workspace, and create custom tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\n**AI Model Flexibility:**\nRoo Code is open-source and fully customizable, letting you integrate any AI model you choose (e.g, OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs, etc.).(no content)It works great with 10s of models, from frontier to open weight. Choose from the curated selection we offer at-cost or bring your own key.\n\n**Multiple Modes:**\nRoo's Modes keep models focused on a given task and limit their access to tools which are relevant to their role, keeping the context window clearer and avoiding surprises. Modes are even smart enough to ask to switch to another when stepping outside their responsibilities.\n\n**Advanced Configuration:**\nConfiguration profiles: Assign different AI models and settings to specific modes, like using o3 for architecture planning and Claude Sonnet 4 for code execution · Boomerang tasks: Coordinate complex workflows that move between different modes and personas automatically · Advanced context management: Configure context limits, enable automatic condensing, and control exactly what information gets included in each conversation · Customizable codebase indexing: Choose your own embedding providers and vector databases for semantic code search, with full control over search behavior and privacy\n\n**Permission-Based Control:**\nRoo Code is permission-based, meaning you can control and approve any file changes or command executions.\n\n**Pricing:**\nRoo Code is completely free and open-source. You'll only pay for the AI model usage if you use a paid API (like OpenAI).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"2a2f0b05-93f6-4e15-9d6f-f6c36c246653","timestamp":"2026-01-03T15:22:10.027Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Roo Code AI coding assistant features capabilities","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01KFTPHCbV1jSYy7zMN2GCUe","content":[{"title":"Roo Code – The AI dev team that gets things done","url":"https://roocode.com"},{"title":"Roo Code - AI Agent","url":"https://aiagentstore.ai/ai-agent/roo-code"},{"title":"GitHub - RooCodeInc/Roo-Code: Roo Code gives you a whole dev team of AI agents in your code editor.","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code"},{"title":"Roo Code: A Guide With 7 Practical Examples | DataCamp","url":"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/roo-code"},{"title":"How I Effectively Use Roo Code for AI-Assisted Development","url":"https://spin.atomicobject.com/roo-code-ai-assisted-development/"},{"title":"Roo Code review: Autonomous AI-powered development in the IDE | InfoWorld","url":"https://www.infoworld.com/article/4019646/roo-code-review-a-first-look-at-autonomous-ai-powered-development-in-the-ide.html"},{"title":"Roo Code review: A perspective on AI-powered coding - Qubika","url":"https://qubika.com/blog/roo-code/"},{"title":"Roo Code - AI Agent for Debugging and Code Completion","url":"https://bestaiagents.ai/agent/roo-code"},{"title":"Roo Cline","url":"https://roocline.dev/"},{"title":"Build Your Ultimate Coding Agent: Deepseek R1 & Roo Code","url":"https://apidog.com/blog/deepseek-r1-roocode-ai/"}]},"I've found comprehensive information about Roo Code and its features. Here's what I learned:\n\n## Overview\n\nRoo Code is an open-source, AI-powered coding assistant that runs in VS Code.(no content)It goes beyond simple autocompletion by reading and writing across multiple files, executing commands, and adapting to your workflow—like having a whole dev team right inside your editor.\n\n## Key Features and Capabilities\n\n**Multi-File Editing:**\nIt's built for multi-file edits, so it can read, refactor, and update multiple files at once for holistic code changes.\n\n**Agentic Abilities:**\nIts agentic abilities go beyond a typical AI autocomplete, enabling it to run tests, open a browser, and handle deeper tasks.(no content)Roo Code demonstrates high autonomy through its ability to execute terminal commands, automate browser actions, edit files directly in workspace, and create custom tools via Model Context Protocol (MCP).\n\n**AI Model Flexibility:**\nRoo Code is open-source and fully customizable, letting you integrate any AI model you choose (e.g, OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs, etc.).(no content)It works great with 10s of models, from frontier to open weight. Choose from the curated selection we offer at-cost or bring your own key.\n\n**Multiple Modes:**\nRoo's Modes keep models focused on a given task and limit their access to tools which are relevant to their role, keeping the context window clearer and avoiding surprises. Modes are even smart enough to ask to switch to another when stepping outside their responsibilities.\n\n**Advanced Configuration:**\nConfiguration profiles: Assign different AI models and settings to specific modes, like using o3 for architecture planning and Claude Sonnet 4 for code execution · Boomerang tasks: Coordinate complex workflows that move between different modes and personas automatically · Advanced context management: Configure context limits, enable automatic condensing, and control exactly what information gets included in each conversation · Customizable codebase indexing: Choose your own embedding providers and vector databases for semantic code search, with full control over search behavior and privacy\n\n**Permission-Based Control:**\nRoo Code is permission-based, meaning you can control and approve any file changes or command executions.\n\n**Pricing:**\nRoo Code is completely free and open-source. You'll only pay for the AI model usage if you use a paid API (like OpenAI)."],"durationSeconds":26.57319641600002}}

You could literally set up:\n- UI Mode → Gemini \n- Coding Mode → Claude Sonnet 4.5\n- Logic/Architecture Mode → Deepseek R1\n\nThis matches your strategy perfectly.\n\n## **About the Personality Request**\n\nI need to be direct: neither tool will \"cuss\" or have a \"harsher personality\" by default. I'm Claude - I maintain a professional, helpful tone.

Superior Autonomous Execution**\n- More reliable at actually completing tasks end-to-end without getting stuck\n- Better at self-correction when it hits errors\n- Stronger at making architectural decisions on the fly\n\n**2. Better Default Experience**\n- Works out of the box - no API key setup, model selection paralysis\n- Context management is handled automatically\n- More polished UX overall\n\n**3. Stronger Code Quality**\n- Uses latest Claude models (Sonnet 4.5, Opus 4.5) which are objectively excellent at coding\n- Better at understanding complex codebases\n- More reliable refactoring and multi-file edits\n\n**4. Built-in Safety & Planning**\n- Automatic planning mode for complex tasks\n- Better at avoiding breaking changes\n- More conservative (won't fuck up your codebase as easily)\n\n**5. Native Tool Integration**\n- Browser automation built-in\n- Better git workflow integration\n- MCP server support\n\n## **Roo Code Strengths**\n\n**1. Model Flexibility**\n- Switch between GPT-4, Claude, Gemini, Deepseek, local models\n- Use different models for different tasks in same session\n- Access to cheaper/faster models when appropriate\n\n**2. Workflow Customization**\n- \"Modes\" system lets you specialize agents for specific tasks\n- More granular control over what the AI can/can't do\n- Better for teams that want standardized workflows\n\n**3. VS Code Native**\n- Lives in your editor, not terminal\n- Better integration with existing VS Code extensions\n- More familiar environment for most devs\n\n**4. Cost Control**\n- Free tool + pay-per-use API (can be cheaper if you're strategic)\n- Can use open-source models to reduce costs\n- More transparent billing\n\n**5.
