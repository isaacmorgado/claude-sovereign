This moment has been long-awaited by Premiere plugin developers since UXP was originally announced by Adobe back in 2019 and has since made its way into Photoshop and InDesign.\n\n### General Availability Release\n\nThe Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP) has officially graduated from beta and is now available in Adobe Premiere 25.6. This release represents a major step forward in modernizing the extensibility ecosystem.\n\n### Key Developer Resources\n\nWhether you're migrating an existing CEP panel or building something entirely new, developers need to ensure they have Premiere v25.6 installed, along with the latest build, v2.2.1, of the UXP Developer Tools (UDT) to load, debug, and package plugins.(no content)The UXP Developer Tool (UDT) simplifies the process of creating, loading, managing, and debugging plugins for Adobe's UXP-powered applications. UXP plugins are supported in Premiere v25.6 and later since UDT v2.2.\n\n### What UXP Offers\n\nUXP plugins panels are the new way for 3rd party developers to build plugin panels in Adobe applications in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. UXP plugin panels will gradually replace CEP Extensions in Adobe apps on different timelines.(no content)UXP Plugins are JavaScript/HTML/CSS based, however they are built on their own unique stack by Adobe which makes them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack. Additionally, instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has 1 unified environment for your frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction.\n\n### Technical Details\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, which blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous and does not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.(no content)Premiere version (v25.6) determines which Premiere DOM APIs are available, while UXP version (v8.1) determines which UXP Core APIs are available. Each Premiere release integrates a specific UXP version. For example, Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.\n\n### Distribution\n\nDevelopers can now submit polished plugins to the Adobe Marketplace for approval. Installed UXP plugins can be found in the new UXP Plugins submenu under 'Window'.(no content)The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"9513f389-6f69-4af0-86e5-1200ee06d5be","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:39:31.945Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe MAX 2024 Premiere Pro UXP API announcements developer","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01PPs92h4PyytKMZqMbEkDX1","content":[{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development"},{"title":"Update of UXP APIs inside of Premiere Pro - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/update-of-uxp-apis-inside-of-premiere-pro/10384"},{"title":"Premiere Pro UXP Beta — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Essential Development Tools for UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/"},{"title":"Update of UXP APIs in Premiere Pro! - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/update-of-uxp-apis-in-premiere-pro/9120"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about Adobe MAX 2024 and Premiere Pro UXP API announcements for developers:\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP API Announcements\n\nOn December 5th, 2024, Adobe opened their public beta for UXP Plugins in Premiere Pro.

This release represents a major step forward in modernizing Adobe's extensibility ecosystem.(no content)On Dec 5th, 2024, Adobe opened their public beta for UXP Plugins in Premiere Pro. This moment has been long-awaited by Premiere plugin developers since UXP was originally announced by Adobe back in 2019.\n\n## Timeline and Roadmap\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.(no content)No further changes or improvements to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled.\n\n## Timeline Editing API Capabilities\n\nUXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level. With UXP, you can build unique tools that integrate with and optimize the most precise, demanding workflows.(no content)The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin, the right starting point for any future integrations, shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations. There is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks.\n\n## Developer Feedback and Future Direction\n\nThis general release is just the beginning for UXP in Premiere. Adobe would love developer input to help prioritize what comes next. The Creative Cloud Developer Forums remain the best place to ask questions, help fellow developers, and share feature requests.

This release represents a major step forward in modernizing Adobe's extensibility ecosystem.(no content)On Dec 5th, 2024, Adobe opened their public beta for UXP Plugins in Premiere Pro. This moment has been long-awaited by Premiere plugin developers since UXP was originally announced by Adobe back in 2019.\n\n## Timeline and Roadmap\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.(no content)No further changes or improvements to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled.\n\n## Timeline Editing API Capabilities\n\nUXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level. With UXP, you can build unique tools that integrate with and optimize the most precise, demanding workflows.(no content)The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin, the right starting point for any future integrations, shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations. There is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks.\n\n## Developer Feedback and Future Direction\n\nThis general release is just the beginning for UXP in Premiere. Adobe would love developer input to help prioritize what comes next. The Creative Cloud Developer Forums remain the best place to ask questions, help fellow developers, and share feature requests. Developer input directly influences the roadmap.(no content)Adobe has assured developers they should have \"several years\" to complete migration from CEP to UXP once it's out of beta and ready for general release.\n\n## Key Technical Differences\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, blocking the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited."],"durationSeconds":27.974604333000258}}

Adobe has developed an effective customer feedback system around this form.(no content)You can also use this form to report suspected bugs in Adobe products. Adobe normally does not send personal replies to feature requests or bug reports. They do, however, read each and every message.\n\n## Recent Timeline Editing API Feature Request\n\nA recent feature request (posted December 9, 2025) involves a user exploring automation and plugin development for Adobe Premiere Pro, trying to create a tool that automatically consolidates a sequence with multiple video tracks into a single track — similar to manually dragging clips from V5 → V4 → V3 → V2 → V1 while preserving timing. In older versions of Premiere, this could be done through the QE API using functions like `app.enableQE()` and `clip.moveToTrack(videoIndex, audioIndex)`. However, in current Premiere Pro builds (2023–2025), this function appears to exist in the QE object model but is not operational.\n\n### Adobe's Response\n\nAn Adobe representative responded stating \"This is not the case\" and that they're \"not sure why or how you're running into trouble with moveToTrack(); there have been zero changes to QE DOM APIs, and no such changes are planned or scheduled.\"(no content)The response also suggested considering cross-posting in the UXP forum at forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com for UXP-related development.\n\n## Current State of Premiere Pro APIs\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).

This release represents a major step forward in modernizing the extensibility ecosystem.\n\n### Beta Program History\nOn Dec 5th, 2024, Adobe opened their public beta for UXP Plugins in Premiere Pro. This moment was long-awaited by Premiere plugin developers since UXP was originally announced by Adobe back in 2019.\n\n### New APIs Added in 2025\n\n**January 2025 Update:**\nThis update includes new APIs like: AppPreference (give access and control over selected list of app preference settings), FrameRate (give access and control for FrameRate object), and ProjectUtils (give access over user's ProjectItemSelection).\n\n**March 2025 Update:**\nClipProjectItem API which allows for attach proxy or high resolution footage or replace footage (attachProxy(), changeMediaPath()); EncoderManager API which allows for getting file extension based on input sequence and preset (getExportFileExtension()).\n\n### Technical Details\nUXP Plugins are JavaScript/HTML/CSS based, however they are built on their own unique stack by Adobe which makes them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack.

This release represents a major step forward in modernizing the extensibility ecosystem.\n\n### Beta Program History\nOn Dec 5th, 2024, Adobe opened their public beta for UXP Plugins in Premiere Pro. This moment was long-awaited by Premiere plugin developers since UXP was originally announced by Adobe back in 2019.\n\n### New APIs Added in 2025\n\n**January 2025 Update:**\nThis update includes new APIs like: AppPreference (give access and control over selected list of app preference settings), FrameRate (give access and control for FrameRate object), and ProjectUtils (give access over user's ProjectItemSelection).\n\n**March 2025 Update:**\nClipProjectItem API which allows for attach proxy or high resolution footage or replace footage (attachProxy(), changeMediaPath()); EncoderManager API which allows for getting file extension based on input sequence and preset (getExportFileExtension()).\n\n### Technical Details\nUXP Plugins are JavaScript/HTML/CSS based, however they are built on their own unique stack by Adobe which makes them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack. Additionally instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has 1 unified environment for your frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction back and forth.\n\n### Getting Started\nTo get started, ensure you have Premiere v25.6 installed. You will also need the latest build, v2.2.1, of the UXP Developer Tools (UDT) to load, debug, and package your plugins.(no content)If your plugin is polished and ready for distribution, you can now submit it to the Adobe Marketplace for approval.\n\n### Future of CEP\nCEP 12 shipped with Photoshop 25.12, Premiere Pro 25.0, and After Effects 25.0.

The function in QE appears to be stubbed or deprecated without a documented replacement.\n\n### QE DOM `moveToTrack()` Method\n\nIn current Premiere Pro builds (2023–2025), the `moveToTrack` function appears to exist in the QE object model but is not operational. Calling it returns either various signatures like `moveToTrack(int)`, `moveToTrack(int, int)`, `moveToTrack(int, int, boolean)`, or `moveToTrack(trackObject, flags)`, but none resulted in track movement.\n\nHowever, some developers report the method does work. The `moveToTrack` method on QETrackItem accepts four parameters: the first param is amount to move video track, second is amount to move audio track, third is amount to move along track given as timecode string, and fourth is whether to copy instead of move.(no content)The second parameter is not a boolean int - it's like the first one, but for audio - the number of tracks to move an audio to.\n\n### UXP API Alternatives\n\nThe 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin shows how to clone and remove track items as a starting point for integrations.(no content)The SequenceEditor class can duplicate trackItem using an insert or overwrite edit method to a destination track. Target track and start time of trackItem is determined using an offset value from the original trackItem position.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).

The function in QE appears to be stubbed or deprecated without a documented replacement.\n\n### QE DOM `moveToTrack()` Method\n\nIn current Premiere Pro builds (2023–2025), the `moveToTrack` function appears to exist in the QE object model but is not operational. Calling it returns either various signatures like `moveToTrack(int)`, `moveToTrack(int, int)`, `moveToTrack(int, int, boolean)`, or `moveToTrack(trackObject, flags)`, but none resulted in track movement.\n\nHowever, some developers report the method does work. The `moveToTrack` method on QETrackItem accepts four parameters: the first param is amount to move video track, second is amount to move audio track, third is amount to move along track given as timecode string, and fourth is whether to copy instead of move.(no content)The second parameter is not a boolean int - it's like the first one, but for audio - the number of tracks to move an audio to.\n\n### UXP API Alternatives\n\nThe 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin shows how to clone and remove track items as a starting point for integrations.(no content)The SequenceEditor class can duplicate trackItem using an insert or overwrite edit method to a destination track. Target track and start time of trackItem is determined using an offset value from the original trackItem position.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.(no content)UXP in Premiere Pro is still relatively new, so many APIs haven't been built yet. If you need a production panel today or in the near future, you may need to build it in CEP.(no content)According to Adobe, there have been zero changes to QE DOM APIs and no such changes are planned or scheduled. However, the QE DOM will remain 100% unsupported and is not at all recommended.\n\n### Resources\n\n- Official UXP API Documentation: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/\n- UXP Developer Forum: https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/c/uxp-for-premiere-pro/105"],"durationSeconds":23.840194625000002}}

This moment has been long-awaited by Premiere plugin developers since UXP was originally announced by Adobe back in 2019.(no content)UXP now supports Plugins for Premiere Pro v25.1 (Beta).\n\n### Timeline API and ExtendScript Plans\n\nNo further changes or improvements to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled. Any such changes will be reconsidered, once Premiere Pro moves to UXP-based extensibility.(no content)There have been zero changes to QE DOM APIs, and no such changes are planned or scheduled. The QE DOM will also remain 100% unsupported and not at all recommended.(no content)The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin is the right starting point for any future integrations, and shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\n### CEP to UXP Transition Timeline\n\nAdobe has assured developers that they should have \"several years\" to complete migration once UXP is out of beta and ready for general release.(no content)CEP 12 will be the last major update to CEP, although critical security issues will continue to be addressed. There are no new features planned further.(no content)Even once UXP is fully supported, Adobe will provide an overlapping period during which both mechanisms are supported. With the Flex to CEP transition, that was about 1.75 years of overlap.

This moment has been long-awaited by Premiere plugin developers since UXP was originally announced by Adobe back in 2019.(no content)UXP now supports Plugins for Premiere Pro v25.1 (Beta).\n\n### Timeline API and ExtendScript Plans\n\nNo further changes or improvements to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled. Any such changes will be reconsidered, once Premiere Pro moves to UXP-based extensibility.(no content)There have been zero changes to QE DOM APIs, and no such changes are planned or scheduled. The QE DOM will also remain 100% unsupported and not at all recommended.(no content)The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin is the right starting point for any future integrations, and shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\n### CEP to UXP Transition Timeline\n\nAdobe has assured developers that they should have \"several years\" to complete migration once UXP is out of beta and ready for general release.(no content)CEP 12 will be the last major update to CEP, although critical security issues will continue to be addressed. There are no new features planned further.(no content)Even once UXP is fully supported, Adobe will provide an overlapping period during which both mechanisms are supported. With the Flex to CEP transition, that was about 1.75 years of overlap. Adobe has no plans to decommission support for CEP without first allowing for a significant overlap period.\n\n### Developer Recommendations\n\nIf you're building a new tool that you plan to ship in the near future, CEP is still the best way to do this. Keep track of the APIs you're using in CEP and test if those exist and work properly in UXP as you're building out your tool so that your migration to UXP in the future will be as smooth as possible.(no content)Note that UXP Hybrid plugins are not yet implemented in Premiere Pro but will be in the future.\n\n### Getting Pre-Release Access\n\nFor pre-release access, developers can reach out to ppro-uxp-extensibility@adobe.com for more information."],"durationSeconds":25.61451450000005}}

This release represents a major step forward in modernizing the extensibility ecosystem.(no content)As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n### Key UXP Features\n\nUXP is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level. With UXP, you can build unique tools that integrate with and optimize workflows—these tools reduce repetition, maximize efficiency, and transform Premiere into a bespoke application tailored to the needs of any project.(no content)UXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface). With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment, and you just need to require() the appropriate modules to access the APIs you need.\n\n### API Structure\n\nPremiere APIs (also called DOM APIs or Premiere DOM APIs) give you direct access to Premiere's document model. These APIs let you access and modify projects, sequences, tracks, clips, and markers; work with media including importing files and managing project items; control playback including setting in/out points; and apply video and audio effects to clips.(no content)Each Premiere release integrates a specific UXP version. For example, Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.\n\n## Adobe MAX 2025 Premiere Pro Feature Announcements\n\nAI Object Mask in Premiere (public beta) automatically identifies and isolates people and objects in video frames so that they can be edited and tracked without the need for manual rotoscoping. Object Mask makes the process of color grading, blurring and adding special effects to a moving background quicker and easier.(no content)Rectangle, Ellipse and Pen Masking in Premiere (public beta) provides precision tools for isolating specific areas of a video frame.(no content)Fast Vector Mask in Premiere (public beta) is a redesigned masking tool that offers faster tracking, bi-directional tracking and 3D perspective tracking.(no content)Adobe officially launched its new, free Premiere mobile app and announced a partnership with YouTube. Soon, you'll be able to jump from the YouTube Shorts app directly into Premiere mobile to edit your video with pro tools, then publish it right back.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b2cf4fb4-6695-4137-bd82-e7630e83a500","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:42:51.571Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe MAX 2025 Premiere Pro developer API announcements extensibility","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Gt1tiLDmWWDPzdqpDkn6JP","content":[{"title":"UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/"},{"title":"The Ultimate Premiere Pro Feature Request 2025 - Adobe Product Community - 15634461","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/the-ultimate-premiere-pro-feature-request-2025/idi-p/15634461"},{"title":"Adobe MAX 2025: The 10 Key Announcements For Creators | Feisworld","url":"https://www.feisworld.com/blog/adobe-max-2025-keynote-announcements"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"Adobe Max 2025: Premiere Pro & After Effects Updates for Creators","url":"https://elements.envato.com/learn/adobe-max-2025-premiere-after-effects-updates"},{"title":"The Biggest Announcements at Adobe Max 2025","url":"https://www.techloy.com/the-biggest-announcements-at-adobe-max-2025/"},{"title":"Adobe Max 2025: What's Coming?","url":"https://www.editorskeys.com/blogs/news/adobe-max-2025-whats-coming"},{"title":"Adobe Delivers New AI Innovations, Assistants and Models Across Creative Cloud to Empower Creative Professionals","url":"https://news.adobe.com/news/2025/10/adobe-max-2025-creative-cloud"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about Adobe MAX 2025 announcements related to Premiere Pro developer APIs and extensibility:\n\n## UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform) for Premiere Pro\n\nThe Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP) has officially graduated from beta and is now available in Adobe Premiere 25.6.

This is the first general availability release.\n\n### Currently Available Timeline Editing APIs\n\nThe **SequenceEditor** class was added in the March 2025 beta update and includes:\n\n| Method | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `createOverwriteItemAction()` | Overwrites items in the timeline |\n| `createInsertProjectItemAction()` | Inserts project items into a sequence |\n| `createRemoveItemsAction()` | Removes items from the timeline |\n| `createCloneTrackItemAction()` | Duplicates track items with offset positioning |\n\nAdditionally available:\n- **TrackItemSelection API** - `getTrackItems()` for accessing timeline items\n- **ClipProjectItem API** - `attachProxy()`, `changeMediaPath()` for footage management\n- **EncoderManager API** - `getExportFileExtension()` for export handling\n\n### What is NOT Available\n\n**No razor/split/cut API exists.** There is no current method to programmatically split clips at a specific point.\n\n**No moveToTrack() in UXP.** While QE DOM has a `moveToTrack()` function, Adobe explicitly states the QE DOM is \"100% unsupported and not at all recommended.\" The workaround suggested by Adobe is to use clone + remove operations via the `premiere_api` example plugin.\n\n**No timeline view control.** You cannot programmatically zoom, scroll, or manipulate the timeline view.\n\n---\n\n## Official Roadmap Information\n\n### What Adobe Has Stated\n\n1. **No published roadmap exists.** Adobe's position from the [UXP Roadmap forum discussion](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-roadmap/6957) is that there are \"progressive additions/improvements driven by internal requirements and external requests\" with no published schedule.\n\n2. **Community-driven prioritization.** From the [official December 2025 blog post](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development): \"This general release is just the beginning for UXP in Premiere... Your input directly influences our roadmap.\"\n\n3. **1:1 parity goal.** Adobe stated (October 2024) that \"the majority of what was possible via CEP+ExtendScript is now possible using UXP\" and they are working toward full parity.\n\n---\n\n## UXP Hybrid Plugins Status\n\n**Hybrid plugins are NOT YET available for Premiere Pro.** The [Hyper Brew analysis](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/) confirms: \"UXP Hybrid plugins are not yet implemented in Premiere Pro but will be in the future.\"\n\nHybrid plugins (available in Photoshop) allow C++ native code integration, which could enable more advanced timeline manipulation. No timeline has been announced for Premiere Pro support.\n\n---\n\n## ExtendScript/CEP Deprecation Timeline\n\n| Milestone | Date |\n|-----------|------|\n| ExtendScript support continues through | September 2026 |\n| CEP 12 released (final major CEP version) | Late 2024 |\n| UXP General Availability in Premiere | December 2025 (v25.6) |\n| Expected overlap period | ~1.75 years (based on historical Flex-to-CEP transition) |\n\n---\n\n## Comparison: Photoshop UXP Evolution\n\nFor context on how Premiere Pro UXP might evolve, here is Photoshop's timeline:\n\n| Year | Photoshop UXP Feature Added |\n|------|----------------------------|\n| 2020 | UXP first announced at MAX |\n| 2021 | DOM API v2, layer collections, plugin load control |\n| 2022 | Hybrid plugins introduced, ColorSampler API, Preferences API, Path APIs |\n| 2023 | Text layer APIs, CountItems API, Imaging API for pixel access |\n\nPremiere Pro's UXP is approximately 4-5 years behind Photoshop's UXP development.\n\n---\n\n## Adobe Employee Statements (From Forums)\n\n**Bruce Bullis (Adobe Premiere Pro)** stated in [December 2024](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115):\n- \"There have been zero changes to QE DOM APIs, and no such changes are planned or scheduled\"\n- \"The QE DOM will also remain 100% unsupported and not at all recommended\"\n- Directed developers to use the UXP clone/remove approach as a workaround\n\n**Adobe (March 2025):** Stated they are \"working on .mogrt APIs right now; the next SDK pre-release will contain that work\"\n\n---\n\n## Feature Requests with Adobe Responses\n\nThe [Timeline Editing API Support feature request](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115) (December 2025) requested:\n- moveToTrack() functionality\n- Track consolidation APIs\n- Bulk sequence organization\n\n**Adobe's response:** Directed to UXP clone/remove workaround. No commitment to adding native move functionality.\n\n---\n\n## How to Get Updates / Influence Roadmap\n\n1. **Creative Cloud Developer Forums:** [forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/c/uxp-for-premiere-pro/105)\n2. **Prerelease access:** Email ppro-uxp-extensibility@adobe.com\n3. **Adobe Prerelease Programs:** [adobeprerelease.com](https://www.adobeprerelease.com/) (NDA required)\n4. **Feature requests:** [Adobe Wishform](https://www.adobe.com/products/wishform.html)\n\n---\n\n## Summary: What We Know vs What We Do Not Know\n\n### Confirmed\n- SequenceEditor APIs for insert/overwrite/remove/clone (March 2025)\n- ExtendScript supported through September 2026\n- Hybrid plugins coming to Premiere (no date)\n- No roadmap for razor/split API\n- Community feedback shapes priorities\n\n### Not Confirmed / Unknown\n- When moveToTrack will be added to UXP\n- When Hybrid plugins arrive for Premiere\n- Any specific timeline editing APIs beyond current SequenceEditor\n- Whether full CEP+ExtendScript parity will include all QE DOM features\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development - Adobe Developer Blog](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n- [The Premiere UXP API - Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Premiere API Reference - Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [SequenceEditor Class Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/sequenceeditor/)\n- [Update of UXP APIs inside of Premiere Pro - CC Developer Forums](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/update-of-uxp-apis-inside-of-premiere-pro/10384)\n- [UXP Roadmap Discussion - CC Developer Forums](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-roadmap/6957)\n- [Request for Timeline Editing API Support - Adobe Community](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP Beta Analysis - Hyper Brew](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/)\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide - Docs for Adobe](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [How to Join Creative Cloud Prerelease Programs - Adobe Developer Blog](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/how-to-join-creative-cloud-prerelease-programs-ccecc10ae7d3)\n- [Photoshop API Changelog](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/ps_reference/changelog/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":978,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1193,"cache_read_input_tokens":32714,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1193,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGhNVhqrg1DZm8k364Zv","type":"assistant","uuid":"11cb83ee-5d12-45bf-a736-d19660164108","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:44:33.454Z"}
