However, it's important to note that CEP Extensions are in the process of being replaced with UXP extensions (aka UXP Plugins), which no longer use ExtendScript or Node.js, but instead use Adobe's own updated builds of JavaScript and HTML.\n\n### UXP Limitations\n\nUXP can't access local files for security reasons, and some developers suffer for it.

From UXP, you write jsonData, and then Node.js detects it, after that, Node executes ExtendScript, and it can send arguments as well.(no content)This is a complicated way to connect, so it isn't good for plugins to distribute. This is just a temporary solution.\n\n### UXP Architecture\n\nThis is different from what's possible with CEP + CSDK (or even UXP + CSDK) in that the C++ code is distributed with and runs alongside the JavaScript code.

WebAssembly is supported as well.\n\n### UXP CLI Communication\n\nThe UXP CLI and Adobe apps communicate with each other using a WebSocket connection.

However, it's important to note that CEP Extensions are in the process of being replaced with UXP extensions (aka UXP Plugins), which no longer use ExtendScript or Node.js, but instead use Adobe's own updated builds of JavaScript and HTML.\n\n### UXP Limitations\n\nUXP can't access local files for security reasons, and some developers suffer for it. Therefore they also hope to connect ExtendScript from UXP but there's no way to do it directly.\n\n### Workaround Solutions\n\nOne developer created a workaround using a file-watching approach:\n\nNode.js fs module has a watch method which watches certain file or directory, so it can detect changes or updates on file.

In order to leverage WebSocket, update the manifest.json with the network.domains permission.\n\n### Key Configuration Requirements\n\nIn order to leverage WebSocket, update the manifest.json with the network.domains permission. From UXP v7.4.0 onwards `permissions.network.domains` does not support WildCards in top-level domains.\n\n### Known Limitations\n\nThe UXP does not support the HTTP/HTTP2 event source. Some developers have also tried to use WebSocket to connect without any luck. This was a reported issue from February 2023 in the Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums.\n\n## WebSocket vs Polling for Real-Time Communication\n\nThe WebSocket API makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server. With this API, you can send messages to a server and receive responses without having to poll the server for a reply.\n\n### Benefits of WebSockets\n\nBy allowing full-duplex communication, WebSockets eliminate the need for polling, reducing latency and improving the user experience in real-time apps.(no content)Because WebSocket provides a full-duplex, bi-directional communication channel, the server can send messages to the client, and both can send messages at the same time. This makes two-way, multi-user realtime apps highly performant.\n\n### When to Use Polling as Fallback\n\nThe primary reason to use polling is that you are operating in network environments that break WebSockets and SSE. Fallbacks to these techniques are important strategies.(no content)When a WebSocket connection is closed (e.g. due to network issues), the client does not try to reconnect to the server, which means you'll need to write extra code to poll the server, re-establishing the connection when it is available again.\n\n### Socket.IO as an Alternative\n\nIn case the WebSocket connection is not possible, it will fall back to HTTP long-polling. And if the connection is lost, the client will automatically try to reconnect.\n\nIf you're building a UXP plugin that needs to communicate with an external server, WebSocket is officially supported but requires proper manifest configuration. If you're experiencing issues, polling-based approaches can serve as a fallback mechanism.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"ec271a6c-c31c-44de-9a26-ea1a05e03227","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:44:11.126Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"UXP WebSocket client external server communication polling 2024 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01CMU9oZ4n3m5YTMpFxnhorP","content":[{"title":"Real-Time Communication | UXP","url":"https://help.iviva.com/uxp/lucy/lucymessagebus"},{"title":"UXP Web socket under HTTP/2? - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-web-socket-under-http-2/5803"},{"title":"WebSockets for Real-Time Communication (2025)","url":"https://618media.com/en/blog/websockets-for-real-time-communication/"},{"title":"WebSockets vs Server-Sent Events: Key differences and which to use in 2024","url":"https://ably.com/blog/websockets-vs-sse"},{"title":"Client-Server Communication: Polling vs WebSockets | ML & CV Consultant - Abhik Sarkar","url":"https://www.abhik.xyz/concepts/networking/client-server-communication"},{"title":"The WebSocket API (WebSockets) - Web APIs | MDN","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API"},{"title":"Understanding Short Polling, Long Polling, Server Sent Events and Web Sockets - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/shameel/understanding-short-polling-long-polling-server-sent-events-and-web-sockets-20kh"},{"title":"window.WebSocket","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-js/Global%20Members/Data%20Transfers/WebSocket/"},{"title":"Socket.IO","url":"https://socket.io/"},{"title":"WebSocket vs Polling: Real-Time Web Communication Guide 2025 [Updated]","url":"https://www.mergesociety.com/code-report/websocket-polling"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found regarding UXP WebSocket client communication with external servers:\n\n## UXP WebSocket Support\n\nWebSocket provides the API for creating and managing a WebSocket connection to a server, as well as for sending and receiving data on the connection.

Please read about the manifest permissions module before you proceed.(no content)In order to leverage `fetch`, update the `manifest.json` with the `network.domains` permission. From UXP v7.4.0 onwards `permissions.network.domains` does not support wildcards in top-level domains.\n\n## Basic Fetch Example\n\nThis sample app will show you how to load an image in an XD object (Rectangle or Artboard) by making network requests using XHR and fetch.\n\nThe Adobe XD example demonstrates a basic fetch pattern:\n```javascript\nconst url = \"https://dog.ceo/api/breeds/image/random\";\nreturn fetch(url)\n  .then(function (response) {\n    return response.json();\n  })\n  .then(function (jsonResponse) {\n    // handle response\n  });\n```\n\n## Code Samples Available\n\nUXP provides fetch method globally, matching HTML DOM fetch method. See fetch for more details. See web-service-call-js-sample for an example plugin that communicates with a web server.(no content)You can use OAuth to connect to any supporting service that supports it, and provide online functionality in your plugin.

These common APIs include File I/O, Network I/O, and a User Interface layer.(no content)The Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP) is Adobe's modern framework for building plugins across its Creative Cloud applications. UXP replaces the older CEP (Common Extensibility Platform), offering significant improvements in performance, usability, and integration capabilities.\n\n## Daemon Service for Background Processes\n\nCRDT_UXP requires a daemon process to be running in the background. To launch the daemon, open PluginInstaller and navigate to the Preferences window. Check the option \"Launch daemon for Creative Developer Tools when PluginInstaller starts.\"\n\n## Asynchronous Operations and Background Processing\n\nThe JavaScript API supports asynchronous operations, allowing plugins to perform long-running tasks without blocking the application's main thread. This ensures that the application remains responsive and usable even when the plugin is engaged in computationally intensive processes. For example, a plugin could perform complex image analysis or communicate with external servers in the background, without interrupting the user's workflow. This asynchronous capability is crucial for maintaining a smooth and efficient user experience, especially in resource-intensive applications.\n\n## External Integration Capabilities\n\nUXP allows developers to integrate with other connected services, automate and customize workflows, and add brand new features - then easily share them with other Photoshop users.(no content)A UXP plugin serves as an extension to Adobe applications, built upon the Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP). These plugins enhance functionality within supported Adobe products by offering custom tools, automating workflows, and integrating with external services. For instance, a plugin could facilitate batch image processing in Photoshop or streamline content synchronization between InDesign and a content management system.\n\n## Plugin Types and Architecture Options\n\nWith UXP, developers can create plugins with Direct Actions – headless plugins that interface with Photoshop, the host OS, and the network, free of any UI. Great for automation without any user interface. For example, a script that runs from a command palette or toolbar button and processes a batch of images behind the scenes.(no content)Additionally, UXP supports Modal Dialogs – plugins that implement one or more modal dialogs, good for simple user interfaces that don't need to persist. It also supports Panels – full-featured panels that look like any other panel in Photoshop.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- High Performance: UXP plugins load faster and have better resource management. Modern APIs: Developers can leverage JavaScript APIs that are optimized for Photoshop.\n- Security: Improved sandboxing ensures that plugins operate in a secure environment.

Here is the complete summary:\n\n---\n\n## UXP External Process Communication Research Summary\n\n### 1. Bolt UXP Framework\n\n**Repository**: [hyperbrew/bolt-uxp](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp)\n\n**Architecture**:\n- Lightning-fast boilerplate for Adobe UXP Plugins using Svelte, React, or Vue\n- Built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass\n- **Dual-context system**:\n  - **UXP Context** (backend): Handles plugin logic and Adobe app API calls\n  - **Webview Context** (frontend): Full CSS/HTML/DOM support via Edge (Windows) or Safari (macOS)\n\n**Communication Pattern**:\n- Uses **Comlink library** for inter-context communication over `postMessage()` APIs\n- Type-safe async function calls between contexts\n- Functions exported from `src/api/uxp.ts` become accessible to Webview via an `api` object\n- WebSocket-based hot reload mechanism during development\n\n**Hybrid Plugin Support**:\n- C++ addons compile to `.uxpaddon` binaries for performance-critical operations\n- Organized by platform: macOS (arm64, x64) and Windows (x64)\n\n---\n\n### 2. MCP Servers for Premiere Pro UXP\n\n**Yes, several MCP servers exist for Premiere Pro**:\n\n| Project | URL | Description |\n|---------|-----|-------------|\n| **adb-mcp** | [mikechambers/adb-mcp](https://github.com/mikechambers/adb-mcp) | MCP servers for Photoshop, Premiere Pro, InDesign |\n| **adobe-mcp** | [david-t-martel/adobe-mcp](https://github.com/david-t-martel/adobe-mcp) | Unified MCP server for Adobe Creative Suite |\n| **Adobe Premiere Pro MCP** | [hetpatel-11](https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/adobe-premiere-pro) | Natural language video editing commands |\n\n**Critical Architecture Pattern**:\n```\nAI Client <-> MCP Server (Python) <-> Command Proxy Server (Node.js) <-> UXP Plugin <-> Adobe App\n```\n\n**Why the Proxy Server is Required**:\n> \"The public facing API for UXP-based JavaScript plugins does not allow it to listen on a socket connection (as a server)\"\n\nUXP plugins can only initiate **outbound** connections. They cannot accept inbound socket connections, necessitating an intermediary proxy layer.\n\n**Requirements**:\n- Python 3 for MCP server\n- Node.js for proxy server (runs on `ws://localhost:3001`)\n- Adobe UXP Developer Tool\n- Premiere Pro Beta 25.3+ (UXP is experimental)\n\n---\n\n### 3. External Python/Node.js Communication with UXP\n\n**Method 1: WebSocket (Outbound Connection)**\n\nUXP plugins can connect as WebSocket clients to external servers:\n\n```javascript\n// manifest.json - Required permission\n{\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": [\"localhost\", \"your-server.com\"]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nFrom UXP v7.4.0 onwards, wildcards in top-level domains are not supported.\n\n**Method 2: HTTP Fetch API**\n\n```javascript\nconst response = await fetch(\"https://your-api.com/endpoint\");\nconst data = await response.json();\n```\n\n**Limitations**:\n- Only HTTPS is supported (no HTTP for localhost without workarounds)\n- Requests may be cached\n- UXP cannot run an HTTP server natively\n\n**Method 3: File-Watching Bridge** ([tokyosheep/connectWithExtendAndUXP](https://github.com/tokyosheep/connectWithExtendAndUXP))\n\n```\nUXP writes JSON -> Node.js fs.watch() detects change -> Node executes ExtendScript -> Results returned\n```\n\nThis workaround enables communication when WebSocket is not viable.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Hybrid Architectures: UXP Polling External Services\n\n**OAuth Polling Pattern** (from [Adobe XD docs](https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/tutorials/how-to-integrate-with-OAuth/)):\n\n```javascript\n// Plugin polls server for OAuth token\nfunction pollForToken(sessionId) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const poll = setInterval(async () => {\n      const response = await fetch(`https://your-server.com/check-token?session=${sessionId}`);\n      const data = await response.json();\n      if (data.accessToken) {\n        clearInterval(poll);\n        resolve(data.accessToken);\n      }\n    }, 6000); // Poll every 6 seconds\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**MCP Proxy Architecture** (from adb-mcp):\n- UXP plugin establishes outbound WebSocket connection to proxy\n- Proxy receives commands from MCP server\n- Plugin executes commands and returns results\n- Effectively inverts the connection model\n\n---\n\n### 5. UXP Polling/Long-Polling for Server Behavior\n\n**Yes, UXP can simulate server behavior through polling**:\n\n**Short Polling Pattern**:\n```javascript\nasync function pollCommands() {\n  while (true) {\n    const response = await fetch(\"https://your-server.com/pending-commands\");\n    const commands = await response.json();\n    for (const cmd of commands) {\n      await executeCommand(cmd);\n    }\n    await sleep(1000); // Poll interval\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**WebSocket as Preferred Alternative**:\nWebSockets provide full-duplex communication, eliminating polling overhead:\n\n```javascript\nconst ws = new WebSocket(\"wss://your-server.com/uxp-channel\");\nws.onmessage = (event) => {\n  const command = JSON.parse(event.data);\n  executeCommand(command);\n};\n```\n\n**Limitation**: UXP WebSocket can only connect outbound, not listen for inbound connections.\n\n---\n\n### 6. UXP + External Daemon/Service Architectures\n\n**Architecture A: CRDT_UXP Daemon** ([zwettemaan/CRDT_UXP](https://github.com/zwettemaan/CRDT_UXP))\n\n- Daemon runs HTTPS server on `localhost.tgrg.net` (resolves to 127.0.0.1)\n- **Breaks out of UXP sandbox** for:\n  - Unrestricted file system access (`dirCreate`, `fileRead`, `fileWrite`, etc.)\n  - Environment access (`getEnvironment`)\n  - Process control\n  - Encryption/decryption\n- Requires PluginInstaller and registered developer account\n\nAPI Documentation: [CRDT_UXP crdtuxp.html](https://zwettemaan.github.io/CRDT_UXP/crdtuxp.html)\n\n**Architecture B: MCP Proxy Model**\n\n```\n┌─────────────────┐     ┌──────────────────┐     ┌─────────────────┐\n│ Python MCP      │     │ Node.js Proxy    │     │ UXP Plugin      │\n│ Server          │────>│ (ws://localhost) │<────│ (outbound WS)   │\n│ (AI interface)  │     │ Port 3001        │     │                 │\n└─────────────────┘     └──────────────────┘     └─────────────────┘\n                                                          │\n                                                          v\n                                                 ┌─────────────────┐\n                                                 │ Adobe App       │\n                                                 │ (Premiere, PS)  │\n                                                 └─────────────────┘\n```\n\n**Architecture C: C++ Hybrid Plugin** ([Adobe Docs](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/))\n\n- Bundle C++ native libraries with JavaScript plugin\n- C++ can create HTTP servers, socket listeners, etc.\n- Communication via N-API-modeled interface\n- Requires code signing and notarization for distribution\n\n---\n\n## Practical Solutions Summary\n\n| Approach | Complexity | Capabilities | Best For |\n|----------|------------|--------------|----------|\n| **WebSocket Client** | Low | Outbound bidirectional communication | Simple external API integration |\n| **HTTP Polling** | Low | Periodic server checks | OAuth, status updates |\n| **MCP Proxy Architecture** | Medium | Full AI/automation integration | Claude/AI-driven workflows |\n| **CRDT_UXP Daemon** | Medium | Sandbox escape, file system | Complex workflows needing full access |\n| **File-Watching Bridge** | Medium | ExtendScript interop | Legacy script integration |\n| **C++ Hybrid Plugin** | High | Full native capabilities including servers | Performance-critical, server hosting |\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Bolt UXP - Hyper Brew](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp)\n- [adb-mcp by Mike Chambers](https://github.com/mikechambers/adb-mcp)\n- [adobe-mcp by David Martel](https://github.com/david-t-martel/adobe-mcp)\n- [Adobe UXP Hybrid Plugins](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/)\n- [UXP WebSocket API](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-js/Global%20Members/Data%20Transfers/WebSocket/)\n- [CRDT_UXP](https://github.com/zwettemaan/CRDT_UXP)\n- [CRDT_UXP Documentation](https://zwettemaan.github.io/CRDT_UXP/crdtuxp.html)\n- [connectWithExtendAndUXP](https://github.com/tokyosheep/connectWithExtendAndUXP)\n- [Mike Chambers Blog - AI Integration](https://www.mikechambers.com/blog/post/2025-06-06-exploring-ai-integration-with-adobe-photoshop-indesign-and-premiere-pro/)\n- [Adobe XD Network Requests Tutorial](https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/tutorials/how-to-make-network-requests/)\n- [InDesign UXP Network Recipes](https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/resources/recipes/network/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1115,"cache_read_input_tokens":26772,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1115,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWJq6JmGhjho1zx1NMZ5Z","type":"assistant","uuid":"75dbe7a1-46c6-402b-97c4-8f1b98accdea","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:46:56.540Z"}
