Also, Premiere Pro retains the sequence markers, sequence settings, track layout, locked tracks, and sequence timecode start points of Final Cut Pro source projects.\n\n### Basic Import Process\n\nIn Premiere Pro, select File > Import. Browse to the XML file, and click Open. Alternatively, you can drag the XML File into the Media Pool.\n\n### Common Clip Duration Issues\n\nA known issue exists when importing XML from DaVinci Resolve to Premiere Pro. Users have reported that after importing XML, they \"get a timeline with the correct video and cuts, but all of them starting indeed from 00:00:00:00\" - meaning clip in/out points are not being preserved correctly.\n\n### Frame Handles for Roundtrip Workflows\n\nFrame handles determine the number of frames to include before and after the clips' in and out points. It's always best to add at least 24 frames for your export, to make sure you have the flexibility to tweak your clips or transitions once you're back in Premiere.\n\n### XML Settings When Importing\n\nWhen you import an XML file, a dialogue window appears. In many cases, the default settings will work fine, and our imported timeline matches the original sequence from Premiere. However, you may want to change the timeline resolution, which defaults to 1920×1080.\n\n### Converting FCP X Files\n\nFinal Cut Pro X exports a .fcpxml file, which Premiere Pro does not recognize. To bring in an FCP X file into Premiere Pro, you need a converter tool that converts the .fcpxml file generated from Final Cut Pro X into a standard .xml file that Premiere Pro can import. Adobe recommends using the XtoCC tool for this conversion.\n\n### Avoiding Media Duplication\n\nPremiere Pro stores metadata that helps it determine which files exist in a project, however when roundtripping via XML through a non-Adobe app this metadata can get lost, resulting in Premiere duplicating all of the existing media in the project upon import.\n\nIs there something specific about XML import settings or clip duration in Premiere Pro that you'd like me to search for in more detail?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"f88bcc21-bbea-40d1-ada9-f44a9193c75f","timestamp":"2025-12-19T21:56:25.109Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro XML import settings clip duration","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_012zuzAbXDw3UsEWyRgaKMCj","content":[{"title":"Import to Adobe Premiere FAQ - Opus Clip","url":"https://help.opus.pro/docs/article/import-to-adobe-premiere"},{"title":"Import XML files from Final Cut Pro 7 and Final Cut Pro X","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/importing-xml-project-files-final.html"},{"title":"XML from Resolve to Premiere, all clips start at 0:00 - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/xml-from-resolve-to-premiere-all-clips-start-at-00/"},{"title":"Export projects as Final Cut Pro XML in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere/desktop/render-and-export/export-files/export-a-project-as-a-final-cut-pro-xml-file.html"},{"title":"Transferring clips and metadata to Adobe Premiere Pro - Pomfort Knowledge Base Pomfort Knowledge Base","url":"https://kb.pomfort.com/silverstack/importandexport/transferring-clips-metadata-adobe-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Import your edit's XML Into Adobe Premiere | Eddie AI | Your AI video editor","url":"https://help.heyeddie.ai/en/articles/9944870-import-your-edit-s-xml-into-adobe-premiere"},{"title":"How to import sequences into Premiere Pro from XML without duplicating media - Blog - Digital Rebellion","url":"https://www.digitalrebellion.com/blog/posts/how_to_import_sequences_into_premiere_pro_from_xml_without_duplicating_files"},{"title":"Export XML | Premiere Pro | TimeBolt Help & Support","url":"https://help.timebolt.io/adobe-premiere-pro/export-xml-for-premiere-pro-timebolt"},{"title":"The 3 Methods for Premiere to Resolve Roundtrip Workflows","url":"https://www.studionetworksolutions.com/premiere-pro-blackmagic-resolve-workflow/"},{"title":"Welcome to the Premiere Pro User Guide","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/user-guide.html/premiere-pro/using/clips-sequence.html"}]},"Here are the search results for \"Premiere Pro XML import settings clip duration\":\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Importing XML Files in Premiere Pro\n\nYou can import entire projects, selected clips, or selected sequences that you export from Final Cut Pro as XML files.(no content)In Premiere Pro, bins and clips have the same hierarchies and names that they have in the Final Cut Pro source projects.

Once a media file is added to a project, future imports with even slightly different metadata or masterclipid values (even if consistent) are treated as new items.\"(no content)The XML uses references to masterclipid, but does not seem to relate these back to the original clips in the project.

OTIO XMLs that worked fine on PPro 2018 weren't properly loading clip video in/out points in PPro 2019.(no content)Premiere changed how it handles clipitems within sequences.

Premiere Pro has imported and exported a variation of xmeml for many years. Premiere Pro works with a slightly modified xmeml based on the XML from FCP Classic version 6 — not the latest — that has Adobe specific tags included.\n\n### Multicam XML Issues\n\nEach multicam sequence `<clipitem>` points to a `<sequence>` which in turn points to another `<clipitem>` which then points to the correct `<file>`, but many XML reading applications can't decipher this nested hierarchy. The first `<clipitem>` does not have the correct `<masterclipid>`, `<name>` and `<duration>` but those are found either in the second `<clipitem>` or in the subsequent `<file>`.\n\n### Workarounds for FCPXML\n\nFinal Cut Pro X exports a .fcpxml file, which Premiere Pro does not recognize.

Go to File > Import and select the exported XML file. The Project (Sequence), Bins, and all associated clips appear in a single Bin in the Project Panel.\n\n### Existing Project Approach\nWhen transferring projects, many tend to create a new project in Premiere. However, you can easily import a FCP X project into an existing Premiere project. It will be treated as a stand-alone sequence.\n\n### Key Import Details\n- You can import entire projects, selected clips, or selected sequences that you export from Final Cut Pro as XML files. In Premiere Pro, bins and clips have the same hierarchies and names that they have in the Final Cut Pro source projects. Also, Premiere Pro retains the sequence markers, sequence settings, track layout, locked tracks, and sequence timecode start points of Final Cut Pro source projects.\n\n### Important Compatibility Notes\n- Premiere does not read .fcpxml files from FCPX, but it does read .xml files from FCP7. Use a third-party application, such as Intelligent Assistance XtoC (Project X27), to translate the exported .fcpxml into a .xml file, for import into Premiere Pro.\n\n- FCP and Premiere use two different versions of XML (similar to English and French). So, in order for one app to read the XML of the other, it needs to be translated.\n\n### What Gets Preserved\nBin Hierarchy is preserved when migrating collected clips and events from FCPX to Premiere Pro.

XMLs that work fine in Premiere Pro 2018 don't properly load clip video in/out points in Premiere Pro 2019.\n\n### XML Structure Change\nPremiere changed how it handles clipitems within sequences.

Audio pan, gain, and level changes may not transfer accurately.

Now I have comprehensive research. Let me compile the findings for you.\n\n## Premiere Pro FCP XML Import Behavior - Research Report\n\nBased on my research, here are the detailed findings addressing your questions:\n\n### 1. Does Premiere Pro Re-link to Original Media and Ignore XML Timing?\n\n**Partial Re-linking:** Premiere Pro does NOT re-link to original media by ignoring XML timing. Instead:\n- **Timing is preserved:** Clip duration, in/out points, and position in the timeline transfer successfully when the XML is properly structured\n- **Media requires relinking:** The XML contains only \"pointers to where the media is stored,\" not the actual media files. If media paths change, you need to manually relink using File > Relink Media\n- **Requirements for successful import:** Media files must be online and have identical file paths (same drive names, folder structures, and file names)\n\n### 2. Are There Settings That Affect How XML Is Imported?\n\n**Import Dialog Settings:**\n- When importing XML, a dialog window appears with options to customize:\n  - **Timeline resolution** (defaults to 1920×1080) - can be changed\n  - Default settings typically work fine for standard workflows\n  \n**Additional Considerations:**\n- **Frame handles:** Adding 24+ frames of handles before/after clips for flexibility during tweaking\n- **Best import timing:** During rough-cut phase BEFORE adding transitions, titles, color grading, or effects for higher success rates\n- **All-media-import workaround:** Pre-importing all media files before XML import can prevent freezing/crashes\n\n**Critical Metadata Factor:**\n- Premiere relies on internal project metadata—not just file names—to determine duplicates. Inconsistent `masterclipid` values can cause duplicate media creation during import\n\n### 3. Does masterclipid Override clipitem Settings?\n\n**Complex Interaction - Both Matter:**\n- **MasterClipID behavior:** Premiere uses `masterclipid` references to identify clips, but does NOT override `clipitem` settings with in/out points\n- **Structure requirements:** Premiere 2019+ requires clipitems to be wrapped in a `<clip>` element with in/out/duration info positioned directly under `<clip>`, not just under `<clipitem>`\n- **Multicam complexity:** In multicam sequences, the first `<clipitem>` may lack correct `masterclipid`, `name`, and `duration`, with these values found in secondary `<clipitem>` or `<file>` elements\n- **Known bug:** Premiere changed how it handles clipitem structure around 2019, breaking XMLs that worked in 2018\n\n### 4. Search Results for \"Premiere Pro FCP XML import clip duration\" Issues\n\n**Critical Issues Found:**\n\n**2019+ Regression:**\n- Premiere Pro 2019+ has a known issue where imported clips show Video In of `00;00;00;00` and Video Out of `{video duration}` instead of intended in/out points\n- XMLs using the older structure (`sequence→media→video→track→clipitem→{in/out}`) fail; now requires structure wrapped in `<clip>`\n\n**What Transfers Successfully:**\n- Timecode, clip In, Out, and durations (with proper conversion tools)\n- Cross-dissolves, opacity, position, and scaling\n- Sequence markers, track layout, and timecode start points\n\n**Known Failures:**\n- Drop frame/non-drop frame timecode incorrectly converted (always exports as DF for 29.97 fps)\n- Merged clips become nested sequences\n- Audio pan, gain, and level changes may not transfer accurately\n- Some complex effects and transitions don't translate exactly\n\n### 5. Difference Between Importing as New Project vs Into Existing\n\n**New Project (Recommended Approach):**\n- File > Import opens dialog and imports entire project as single bin with all sequences, bins, and clips\n- Cleaner workflow with preserved bin hierarchies\n- Adobe's official recommendation for migrating complete projects\n- All project settings imported with the sequence\n\n**Existing Project Approach:**\n- XML imports as a stand-alone sequence into current project\n- Useful for merging smaller sequences or clips into established projects\n- Can work with XML import, but lacks the automatic hierarchy preservation\n- Risk of metadata conflicts causing duplicate media creation\n\n**Key Difference:** New project imports preserve the original bin structure and hierarchies; existing project imports treat the XML content as individual sequences without the organizational structure.\n\n---\n\n### Critical Technical Notes for Modified Clips:\n\n**For Modified Clips Specifically:**\n1. **Original media paths are essential:** If you've modified clip duration in the XML but kept valid media paths, Premiere should preserve your XML modifications if the structure matches Premiere's expected format\n2. **Version matters:** Ensure your XML structure matches Premiere's current expectations (2019+ requires `<clip>` wrapper)\n3. **Conversion tools needed:** If converting from FCP X (.fcpxml), use XtoCC to properly translate the format\n4. **Test on 2018-compatible structure first:** If seeing duration issues, try exporting from Premiere 2018-compatible tools before 2019+\n\n### Best Practices:\n- Transfer during rough-cut phase only\n- Maintain identical media paths and drive naming\n- Use XtoCC for FCP X conversion\n- Pre-import all media before importing XML to avoid crashes\n- For FCP 7, direct XML export works; for FCP X, requires XtoCC conversion\n- Verify clip structure includes `<clip>` wrapper with duration info\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [Import XML files from Final Cut Pro 7 and Final Cut Pro X (Adobe Official Documentation)](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/importing-xml-project-files-final.html)\n- [FCP 7: Move Projects to Premiere Pro (Larry Jordan)](https://larryjordan.com/articles/fcp-7-move-projects-to-premiere-pro/comment-page-1/)\n- [Transfer Projects Between Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere Pro CC (Larry Jordan)](https://larryjordan.com/articles/move-projects-between-final-cut-pro-x-and-adobe-premiere-pro-cc/)\n- [Premiere CC '19 - FCP XML Video In/Out points not working (GitHub OpenTimelineIO Issue #569)](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenTimelineIO/issues/569)\n- [Demystifying Final Cut Pro XMLs (FCP.Cafe)](https://fcp.cafe/developer-case-studies/fcpxml/)\n- [XtoCC Help (Intelligent Assistance Software)](https://www.intelligentassistance.com/xtocc-help/)\n- [FCP X: Transfer Projects to Premiere Pro CC (Larry Jordan)](https://larryjordan.com/articles/fcp-x-transfer-projects-to-premiere-pro-cc/)\n- [Migrate projects from Final Cut Pro to Premiere Pro (Adobe Help)](https://helpx.adobe.com/si/premiere-pro/how-to/migrate-from-final-cut-pro.html)\n- [Transferring clips and metadata to Adobe Premiere Pro (Pomfort Knowledge Base)](https://kb.pomfort.com/silverstack/importandexport/transferring-clips-metadata-adobe-premiere-pro/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":6,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5568,"cache_read_input_tokens":12759,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5568,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGnwhLLXMeLWDYmJBjgJ","type":"assistant","uuid":"f06ed2ff-c175-4154-ad2d-1ed74e593547","timestamp":"2025-12-19T21:56:59.813Z"}
