ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n### Active Sequence Methods\n\n**Working with Tracks and Clips:**\n- `app.project.activeSequence.videoTracks[x].insertClip(clip, timecode in seconds)` - Inserts a clip at the specified time and shifts existing clips.\n- `app.project.activeSequence.videoTracks[x].overwriteClip(clip, timecode in seconds)` - Overwrites whatever was there before without shifting anything.\n\n**Player Position:**\n- `app.project.activeSequence.getPlayerPosition()` returns the current playhead position. Use `.seconds` to convert from ticks to seconds.\n\n**Work Area:**\n- `seq.getWorkAreaInPointAsTime()` and `seq.getWorkAreaOutPointAsTime()` for getting work area boundaries, and `seq.setWorkAreaInPoint()` / `seq.setWorkAreaOutPoint()` for setting them.\n\n**Markers:**\n- `app.project.activeSequence.markers.getFirstMarker()` - Both Project items and sequences have associated Marker objects. Access marker comments via `.comments` property.\n- `app.project.activeSequence.setPlayerPosition()` to set playhead position and `app.project.activeSequence.markers.createMarker(1)` to add markers.\n\n**Export Functions:**\n- `app.project.activeSequence.exportAsFinalCutProXML(fullPathToOutputFile, 1)`, `exportFramePNG(time, fullPathToOutputFile)`, `exportAsProject(fullPathToOutputFile)`, and `exportAsMediaDirect(fullPathToOutputFile, outPreset.fsName, appencoder.ENCODE_WORKAREA)`.\n\n**Selection:**\n- `app.project.activeSequence.getSelection()` returns currently-selected clips as an Array of trackItems. Combined with `app.bind`, you can get real-time events of selection changes.\n- You can loop through a trackItemCollection and check for the `isSelected()` property. It returns a boolean, and if true, you can get both inPoint and outPoint from the trackItem.\n\n**Iterating Clips:**\n- `app.project.activeSequence.videoTracks[0 thru numTracks].clips[0 thru numClips]` with properties like `[\"name\",\"inPoint\",\"outPoint\",\"start\",\"end\"]`.\n\n### Limitations\n\n\"Mimicking in-timeline editing is not possible through ExtendScript as of today, but you can try to mimic classical 3-point editing.\"(no content)Regarding making cuts on the timeline: \"ExtendScript can already add, remove, and change any trackItem\" - but directly splitting a clip in two based on playhead position \"using ExtendScript at present seems unsupported.\"(no content)No further changes to ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled; Adobe is focused on getting UXP extensibility to 1:1 parity with what's possible via CEP+ExtendScript.\n\n### Documentation Sources\n\n- **Official Scripting Guide**: https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/\n- **Adobe CEP Samples (GitHub)**: https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"edbec59c-2b5b-4884-8155-b3ecd5f68aab","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:32:18.904Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro ExtendScript app.project.activeSequence timeline editing API documentation","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01BaUffTFntp5vTkV9riF7dP","content":[{"title":"Solved: Editing clips with ExtendScript - Adobe Product Community - 9056625","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/editing-clips-with-extendscript/td-p/9056625"},{"title":"Samples/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx at master · Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Using Adobe ExtendScript to Automate Video Editing in Premiere Pro","url":"https://metadesignsolutions.com/using-adobe-extendscript-to-automate-video-editing-in-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Solved: Re: Premiere Pro Scripting ExtendScript question - Adobe Support Community - 13379442","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-extendscript-question/m-p/13380994"},{"title":"Re: How to export an EDL from a timeline using ExtendScript","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/how-to-export-an-edl-from-a-timeline-using-extendscript/m-p/9721602"},{"title":"Having fun with the Active Sequence, Mute Tracks, Place Clips - PremiereOnScript","url":"https://premiereonscript.com/log-11/"},{"title":"GitHub - ibrahimsaber1/PremierePro-Console: A JavaScript console extension for Adobe Premiere Pro that allows you to execute ExtendScript commands directly within Premiere Pro and view their results in real-time.","url":"https://github.com/ibrahimsaber1/PremierePro-Console"},{"title":"Solved: Selected clip in timeline? - Adobe Product Community - 8233928","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/selected-clip-in-timeline/td-p/8233928"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Scripting ExtendScript question - Adobe Product Community - 13379442","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-extendscript-question/td-p/13379442"}]},"Based on the search results, here's information about the Premiere Pro ExtendScript `app.project.activeSequence` timeline editing API:\n\n## Premiere Pro ExtendScript Timeline API Documentation\n\n### Key Resources\n\n\"Premiere Pro's ExtendScript-based API allows for broad control of the entire application.

You must first enable Premiere Pro's QE DOM using `app.enableQE()`, which returns true if QE DOM was enabled.\n\n2. QE DOM methods are not supported, and not at all recommended according to Adobe employees - this is an unofficial/undocumented API.\n\n3. To get an up to date list of methods available in the QE DOM you could call `qe.reflect.methods`.

It's a Time object that is read/write.(no content)The out point set on the source for this TrackItem instance is relative to the beginning of the source. It's also a Time object that is read/write.\n\n### No Direct Cut/Split Function\n\nThere's no such thing as a 'cut', in the API. Instead, you would adjust the duration of the existing trackItem, then insert a new trackItem, representing the remaining portion of the original trackItem.(no content)There's no cut function; you'd need to change the end point of the trackItem (clip).\n\n### Workarounds for Splitting Clips\n\nAs a workaround you can use overwriteClip() with one-frame media and then delete that new media immediately, so you will have two desired cut clips but with a one-frame gap. Another workaround is adjusting inPoint, outPoint, start and end, but it is a bit tricky: clip's inPoint and outPoint work in a strange nonobvious way, so make tests first.\n\n### QE DOM Razor Method\n\nAfter a long time of searching, one user found it was about calling the RAZOR method using the QE (Quality Engineering) library: \"app.enableQE(); var sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence(); var playerTime = sqe.CTI.timecode;\" - QE has a razor method that can be called on a sequence object.(no content)There's no cut function in extendscript API. QE DOM has razor(string, bool, bool) method on sequence and track objects but one user reported failing to get it to work.\n\n### setInPoint/setOutPoint on Sequences (Not TrackItems)\n\nsetInPoint() is not a function to be used with videoTracks.clips.

It's also a Time object that is read/write.\n\n### No Direct Cut/Split Function\n\nThere's no such thing as a 'cut', in the API. Instead, you would adjust the duration of the existing trackItem, then insert a new trackItem, representing the remaining portion of the original trackItem.(no content)There's no cut function; you'd need to change the end point of the trackItem (clip).\n\n### Workarounds for Splitting Clips\n\nAs a workaround you can use overwriteClip() with one-frame media and then delete that new media immediately, so you will have two desired cut clips but with a one-frame gap. Another workaround is adjusting inPoint, outPoint, start and end, but it is a bit tricky: clip's inPoint and outPoint work in a strange nonobvious way, so make tests first.\n\n### QE DOM Razor Method\n\nAfter a long time of searching, one user found it was about calling the RAZOR method using the QE (Quality Engineering) library: \"app.enableQE(); var sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence(); var playerTime = sqe.CTI.timecode;\" - QE has a razor method that can be called on a sequence object.(no content)There's no cut function in extendscript API. QE DOM has razor(string, bool, bool) method on sequence and track objects but one user reported failing to get it to work.\n\n### setInPoint/setOutPoint on Sequences (Not TrackItems)\n\nsetInPoint() is not a function to be used with videoTracks.clips. Any hints on manipulating the clip inPoints and outPoints would be appreciated.\n\nThe sequence-level `setInPoint()` and `setOutPoint()` methods work on the sequence object itself, as shown in the Adobe sample code for creating subsequences and exporting.\n\n### Sample Code for Modifying TrackItem End Point\n\nExample code shows: \"var myClip = app.project.sequences[0].videoTracks[0].clips[0]; if (myClip){ var oldEnd = myClip.end; if (oldEnd){ oldEnd.seconds = oldEnd.seconds + 3; myClip.end = oldEnd; } }\""],"durationSeconds":23.15803450000001}}

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.\n\n### Timeline Editing API Limitations\n\n\"UXP in Premiere Pro is in beta and very very new so lots of APIs haven't been built yet.\"(no content)If you need a production panel today or in the near future, you're going to need to build it in CEP.(no content)There is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks.(no content)However, in current Premiere Pro builds (2023–2025), this function appears to exist in the QE object model but is not operational.(no content)The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin, the right starting point for any future integrations, shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\n### Key Technical Details\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous. This means they blocked the Premiere UI while they were executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition between the ExtendScript DOM and the UXP DOM, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### Migration Timeline\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP; Unified Extensibility Platform.

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.\n\n### Timeline Editing API Limitations\n\n\"UXP in Premiere Pro is in beta and very very new so lots of APIs haven't been built yet.\"(no content)If you need a production panel today or in the near future, you're going to need to build it in CEP.(no content)There is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks.(no content)However, in current Premiere Pro builds (2023–2025), this function appears to exist in the QE object model but is not operational.(no content)The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin, the right starting point for any future integrations, shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\n### Key Technical Details\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous. This means they blocked the Premiere UI while they were executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition between the ExtendScript DOM and the UXP DOM, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### Migration Timeline\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP; Unified Extensibility Platform. ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.\n\n### Resources\n\n- **Official UXP API Documentation**: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/\n- **Sample Plugins**: The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available here: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n- **UXP Developer Forums**: https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/c/uxp-for-premiere-pro/105\n\n### Summary\n\nThe UXP API for Premiere Pro is still relatively new and has limited timeline editing capabilities.

Does ExtendScript Provide Razor Tool or Clip Splitting Functionality?\n\n**No, there is no direct \"cut\" or \"razor\" function in the official ExtendScript API.**\n\nHowever, there are two approaches:\n\n### Option A: QE DOM Razor Method (Unsupported/Unofficial)\n```javascript\n// Enable Quality Engineering library (unsupported API)\napp.enableQE();\n\n// Get the active QE sequence\nvar sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence();\n\n// Get player time in timecode format \"00:00:03:38\"\nvar playerTime = sqe.CTI.timecode;\n\n// Razor on a specific track\nsqe.getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(playerTime);\n\n// Or razor on all tracks\nsqe.razor(playerTime);\n```\n\n**Warning**: The QE DOM is undocumented and unsupported by Adobe. It was built for internal testing and may break in future versions.\n\n### Option B: Manual Workaround Using TrackItem Properties\n```javascript\n// Adjust the existing clip's end point, then insert a new clip\n// for the remaining portion\n\nvar clip = app.project.activeSequence.videoTracks[0].clips[0];\nvar splitTime = 5.0; // seconds\n\n// Store original values\nvar originalOutPoint = clip.outPoint.seconds;\nvar originalEnd = clip.end.seconds;\n\n// Shorten the first clip\nvar newEnd = clip.end;\nnewEnd.seconds = splitTime;\nclip.end = newEnd;\n\n// Then insert the remaining portion as a new clip\n// (requires the source projectItem and calculating new in/out points)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Timeline Editing APIs Available in ExtendScript for Premiere Pro\n\n### Sequence Object Methods\n| Method | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `insertClip(projectItem, time, vTrackIndex, aTrackIndex)` | Inserts clip, shifts existing clips |\n| `overwriteClip(projectItem, time, vTrackIndex, aTrackIndex)` | Inserts clip, overwrites existing content |\n| `getSelection()` | Returns array of selected TrackItem objects |\n| `linkSelection()` / `unlinkSelection()` | Link/unlink selected clips |\n| `createSubsequence()` | Creates subsequence from in to out point |\n| `getPlayerPosition()` | Gets CTI position in ticks |\n| `setPlayerPosition(time)` | Moves playhead |\n| `setInPoint(time)` / `setOutPoint(time)` | Sets sequence in/out points |\n| `performSceneEditDetectionOnSelection()` | Detects scene cuts |\n\n### Track Object Properties\n- `app.project.activeSequence.videoTracks` - TrackCollection of video tracks\n- `app.project.activeSequence.audioTracks` - TrackCollection of audio tracks\n- Each track has a `clips` property (TrackItemCollection)\n\n### TrackItem Properties (Read/Write)\n| Property | Type | Description |\n|----------|------|-------------|\n| `inPoint` | Time | Source in point (relative to source start) |\n| `outPoint` | Time | Source out point (relative to source start) |\n| `start` | Time | Timeline start position |\n| `end` | Time | Timeline end position |\n| `name` | String | Clip name |\n| `projectItem` | ProjectItem | Reference to source media |\n\n---\n\n## 3. Using app.project.activeSequence for Clip Manipulation\n\n### Basic Access Pattern\n```javascript\n// Get active sequence\nvar seq = app.project.activeSequence;\n\n// Access video tracks\nvar videoTrack = seq.videoTracks[0];\n\n// Iterate through clips on track\nfor (var i = 0; i < videoTrack.clips.numItems; i++) {\n    var clip = videoTrack.clips[i];\n    $.writeln(\"Clip: \" + clip.name);\n    $.writeln(\"  Start: \" + clip.start.seconds);\n    $.writeln(\"  End: \" + clip.end.seconds);\n    $.writeln(\"  InPoint: \" + clip.inPoint.seconds);\n    $.writeln(\"  OutPoint: \" + clip.outPoint.seconds);\n}\n\n// Get selected clips\nvar selection = seq.getSelection();\nfor (var j = 0; j < selection.length; j++) {\n    $.writeln(\"Selected: \" + selection[j].name);\n}\n\n// Get current playhead position\nvar playerPos = seq.getPlayerPosition();\nvar playerSeconds = playerPos.seconds;\n```\n\n### Inserting Clips\n```javascript\nvar projectItem = app.project.rootItem.children[0]; // First item in project\nvar insertTime = 10.0; // seconds\nvar videoTrackIndex = 0;\nvar audioTrackIndex = 0;\n\n// Insert (shifts existing clips)\nseq.insertClip(projectItem, insertTime, videoTrackIndex, audioTrackIndex);\n\n// Or overwrite (replaces existing content)\nseq.overwriteClip(projectItem, insertTime, videoTrackIndex, audioTrackIndex);\n```\n\n### Modifying Clip Duration\n```javascript\nvar clip = seq.videoTracks[0].clips[0];\n\n// Extend clip by 3 seconds\nvar newEnd = clip.end;\nnewEnd.seconds = newEnd.seconds + 3;\nclip.end = newEnd;\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Is CEP Still Supported in Premiere Pro 2024/2025?\n\n**Yes, CEP is still fully supported.**\n\n| Version | Status |\n|---------|--------|\n| **CEP 12** | Shipped with Premiere Pro 25.0 (2024/2025) |\n| **CEP Future** | CEP 12 is the last major update; security patches will continue |\n| **ExtendScript** | Supported through at least **September 2026** |\n| **Deprecation** | No retirement schedule announced; Adobe commits to \"significant overlap period\" before any deprecation |\n\n**Key Points**:\n- CEP extensibility is \"very definitely still supported\"\n- Adobe will provide 1.5-2 years of overlap when transitioning (based on Flex-to-CEP precedent)\n- For production panels shipping soon, **CEP remains recommended**\n\n---\n\n## 5. Differences Between CEP and UXP for Premiere Pro\n\n| Feature | CEP (Current) | UXP (Beta/Future) |\n|---------|---------------|-------------------|\n| **Status** | Production-ready, stable | Public beta (Dec 2024) |\n| **Engine** | Chromium Embedded Framework | Adobe's lightweight JS engine |\n| **Performance** | Higher memory usage | Faster load, lower memory |\n| **ExtendScript** | Full access via evalScript() | Not available |\n| **API Completeness** | Full DOM + QE DOM | Limited, growing |\n| **Timeline Editing** | Supported (via ExtendScript) | Limited/incomplete |\n| **Razor/Split** | Via QE DOM (unsupported) | Not yet available |\n| **Async Model** | Synchronous (blocks UI) | Asynchronous (non-blocking) |\n| **Support Timeline** | Through Sept 2026+ | Full release expected 2025 |\n\n### UXP Current Limitations\n- No razor tool or clip splitting API\n- Cannot move clips between tracks\n- Many timeline editing APIs not yet implemented\n- Still in beta with limited documentation\n\n### Recommendation\n- **For production now**: Use CEP + ExtendScript\n- **For future-proofing**: Start testing UXP, provide feedback to Adobe\n- **For timeline manipulation**: CEP + ExtendScript (with QE DOM if needed)\n\n---\n\n## Official Documentation Links\n\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide (ExtendScript)](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [Adobe CEP Samples (GitHub)](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [UXP Developer Forums](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/c/uxp-for-premiere-pro/105)\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [ExtendScript Split Clip Discussion](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/extendscript-split-clip-using-insertclip-method/m-p/14432687)\n- [Perform a Cut from Script](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/perform-a-cut-from-script/td-p/11389974)\n- [CEP Support Status](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/is-cep-still-supported/td-p/14093791)\n- [UXP Current Status](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-current-status-for-premiere/td-p/12121301)\n- [Premiere Pro QE API Guide](https://vakago-tools.com/premiere-pro-qe-api/)\n- [Adobe Tech Blog - CEP Updates](https://medium.com/adobetech/updates-for-creative-cloud-desktop-extensibility-0dd5c663563e)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP Beta Announcement](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/)\n- [Sequence Object Documentation](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/sequence/sequence/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":124,"cache_read_input_tokens":24768,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":124,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWJpCDjCfpU3Ct4EKRf3h","type":"assistant","uuid":"e8363f71-c15c-4df2-a42b-6df5275d0629","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:35:03.937Z"}
