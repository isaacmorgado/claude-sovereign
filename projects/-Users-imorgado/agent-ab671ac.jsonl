I'm ready to help you explore the codebase and design implementation plans for the Suno Premiere Pro Plugin project. Based on the context provided, this is an AI-powered music generation plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro with a web app backend integration.\n\nThe project has completed architecture research and is at the decision/implementation phase. Key areas include:\n- CEP plugin development (with CEP deprecation Sept 2026 consideration)\n- NestJS backend with BullMQ for job queues\n- Suno API integration via middleware proxy\n- Audio analysis with librosa\n- Cloudflare R2 for storage\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or plan? For example:\n- Evaluate CEP vs UXP migration path\n- Design the monorepo structure\n- Plan the NestJS backend API skeleton\n- Architect the audio analysis pipeline\n- Design the plugin UI component structure"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1593,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWDCRMr1bUpBPhaKXBYp7","type":"assistant","uuid":"4dd7df6f-d592-4b67-bf49-508ea1953e6c","timestamp":"2025-12-18T00:22:15.183Z"}
