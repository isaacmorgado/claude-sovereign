However, for this planning session, I'll focus on read-only exploration and design work.\n\n**What would you like me to help you plan or explore?** \n\nFor example:\n- \"Design an approach to add feature X to project Y\"\n- \"Explore how authentication works in this codebase\"\n- \"Plan a refactoring of component Z\"\n- \"Analyze the testing strategy and recommend improvements\"\n\nPlease share:\n1.
