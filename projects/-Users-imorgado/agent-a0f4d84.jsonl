ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.\n\n### 2025 Release Timeline\nThe current plan is to officially release UXP extensibility, approaching 1:1 parity, this calendar year; perhaps even this summer. This information came from Adobe Employee Bruce Bullis in June 2025.\n\nAs of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins. The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available here: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n\n### Development Progress\nPlacing trackItems into sequences has been in UXP for months. Adobe is working on .mogrt APIs right now; the next SDK pre-release will contain that work.(no content)Adobe's first goal is parity with what ExtendScript could already do. Applying effects works, and UXP plugins can make Undo groupings, instead of introducing a new Undo item with each API call.\n\n### Adobe Media Encoder (AME) UXP Support\nAME will soon be onboarding with UXP. The private beta was tentatively scheduled for December, with general availability (GA) coinciding with the Premiere Pro release. For pre-release access, developers can reach out to ppro-uxp-extensibility@adobe.com.\n\n### CEP Transition\nAdobe has no plans to decommission support for CEP, without first allowing for a significant overlap period.(no content)Even once UXP is fully supported, Adobe will provide an overlapping period during which both mechanisms are supported; with the Flex to CEP transition, that was about 1.75 years of overlap.\n\n### Resources\n- Official documentation: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/\n- Sample plugins: https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples\n- UXP Dev Forum: https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/c/uxp-for-premiere-pro/105\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5892bfde-5184-4723-8b3f-e73a7e3691d8","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:30:45.928Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP Premiere Pro support timeline 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01HqA8NgZ95Gnxs54BkFb1QG","content":[{"title":"Solved: Re: Full UXP support ETA - Adobe Product Community - 15352929","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/full-uxp-support-eta/m-p/15417359"},{"title":"Solved: Full UXP support ETA - Adobe Product Community - 15352929","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/full-uxp-support-eta/td-p/15352929"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"Premiere Pro feature summary (September 2025 release)","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/whats-new/2025-5.html"},{"title":"Solved: UXP current status for premiere? - Adobe Product Community - 12121301","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-current-status-for-premiere/td-p/12121301"},{"title":"Premiere and UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/"},{"title":"Updates for Creative Cloud Desktop Extensibility | by Padma Krishnamoorthy | Adobe Tech Blog | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/adobetech/updates-for-creative-cloud-desktop-extensibility-0dd5c663563e"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Solved: UXP: Everything I need to know? - Adobe Product Community - 15476462","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-everything-i-need-to-know/m-p/15476462"}]},"Based on the search results, here's the information about Adobe UXP support for Premiere Pro timeline in 2025:\n\n## Adobe UXP for Premiere Pro - 2025 Timeline\n\n### Current Status\nUXP is the current extensibility standard for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, supported by a constantly growing set of applications, including Premiere (version 25.6), Photoshop, and InDesign.(no content)As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).

The HTML Extension Cookbook section on Debugging Unsigned Extensions explains this process: Windows: Open regedit > HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Adobe/CSXS.8, then add a new entry PlayerDebugMode of type \"string\" with the value of \"1\". Mac: In the Terminal, type: defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.8 PlayerDebugMode 1\n\n### Creating a .debug File\n\nTo enable panel debugging, just create a file called .debug in the root of your extension folder, containing XML like this: The ID should match the Extension ID in your manifest (not the ExtensionBundleID), while the host name specifies which tool you're testing in.(no content)List the Host IDs for each app your extension supports, with a corresponding port of your choosing for debugging. In this example, we've listed the Host IDs for Photoshop. The full list of host application ports is available in the CEP Cookbook.\n\n### Connecting to Chrome DevTools\n\nOpen Chrome and go to http://localhost:8088/ or whichever port you set in your .debug file in the previous section. If your panel is working, you'll see the name of your extension as a link you can click on.(no content)The link will take you to the JavaScript Console within Chromium DevTools. The JavaScript Console is where, among other things, you will see your extension's log and error output.\n\n### Testing Workflow\n\nIf you make changes to your index.html or index.js file, you'll need to open and close your panel within the application (in this case Photoshop) to see the changes. Then, refresh your debugging tab in Chrome. However, if you make a change in the manifest.xml file, or the index.jsx file, you'll have to quit out of Photoshop (or whichever application) and relaunch it. Then you'll have to open a new Chrome tab or window and go to the localhost page again.\n\n### Debugging Different Code Types\n\nCEP Extension / ES6 == Debugging in Chrome Dev Tools. ExtendScript / ES3 == Debugging in VS Code with Adobe's ExtendScript debugger extension. You can run these both at the same time if you like.\n\n### Why Chrome DevTools Works\n\nThe reason you use the Chrome DevTools for CEP development is because the panels themselves have a version of Chromium built in: the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). Regardless of the integration approach, the engine itself is Chromium and it supports the Chrome DevTools protocols.

The HTML Extension Cookbook section on Debugging Unsigned Extensions explains this process: Windows: Open regedit > HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Adobe/CSXS.8, then add a new entry PlayerDebugMode of type \"string\" with the value of \"1\". Mac: In the Terminal, type: defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.8 PlayerDebugMode 1\n\n### Creating a .debug File\n\nTo enable panel debugging, just create a file called .debug in the root of your extension folder, containing XML like this: The ID should match the Extension ID in your manifest (not the ExtensionBundleID), while the host name specifies which tool you're testing in.(no content)List the Host IDs for each app your extension supports, with a corresponding port of your choosing for debugging. In this example, we've listed the Host IDs for Photoshop. The full list of host application ports is available in the CEP Cookbook.\n\n### Connecting to Chrome DevTools\n\nOpen Chrome and go to http://localhost:8088/ or whichever port you set in your .debug file in the previous section. If your panel is working, you'll see the name of your extension as a link you can click on.(no content)The link will take you to the JavaScript Console within Chromium DevTools. The JavaScript Console is where, among other things, you will see your extension's log and error output.\n\n### Testing Workflow\n\nIf you make changes to your index.html or index.js file, you'll need to open and close your panel within the application (in this case Photoshop) to see the changes. Then, refresh your debugging tab in Chrome. However, if you make a change in the manifest.xml file, or the index.jsx file, you'll have to quit out of Photoshop (or whichever application) and relaunch it. Then you'll have to open a new Chrome tab or window and go to the localhost page again.\n\n### Debugging Different Code Types\n\nCEP Extension / ES6 == Debugging in Chrome Dev Tools. ExtendScript / ES3 == Debugging in VS Code with Adobe's ExtendScript debugger extension. You can run these both at the same time if you like.\n\n### Why Chrome DevTools Works\n\nThe reason you use the Chrome DevTools for CEP development is because the panels themselves have a version of Chromium built in: the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). Regardless of the integration approach, the engine itself is Chromium and it supports the Chrome DevTools protocols. This means that you can debug a CEP panel with any application that supports the Chrome Debugger Protocol.\n\n### Troubleshooting\n\nIf your debug console in Chrome appears blank, check the contents of your .debug file one more time: Does your extension ID in the .debug file match what's in manifest.xml? Are you listing the supported host app(s) correctly with the right Host ID(s)? Are you attempting to access localhost on the same port that you have indicated in your debug console?\n\n### VS Code Alternative\n\nThe PProPanel sample contains a JavaScript debugging configuration, for use with Visual Studio Code.(no content)A typical VS Code launch.json configuration for debugging includes both ExtendScript and Chrome attachment configurations, using a port like 7777 for Chrome attachment."],"durationSeconds":30.360074416000398}}

This means you are free to use it in your free or commercial projects.\n\n## Configuration Setup\n\n### Enabling Debug Mode\nAdobe CEP's PlayerDebugMode must be enabled on your machine to test `yarn build` or `yarn dev` builds. Only an installed ZXP with `yarn zxp` will work without PlayerDebugMode enabled.(no content)Enable this easily with the aescripts ZXP Installer > Settings > Debug > Enable Debugging, or enable manually per OS by following the CEP Cookbook Instructions: Adobe CEP 12 Cookbook.\n\n### Building and Running\nBuild the extension (must run before dev, can also run after for panel to work statically without the process). Symlink is created to extensions folder. Run the extension in HMR Hot-reload mode for rapid development. Both JS and ExtendScript folders re-build on changes. Viewable in browser via localhost:3000/panel/.\n\n### Configuration File\nAdd the host to your cep.config.ts file.(no content)Panels are configured in the cep.config.ts. Each panel can be edited in their respective folders in the `src/js/` directory. To add panels, add an item to the panels object in cep.config.ts, and duplicate the folder structure and adjust as needed.\n\n### ExtendScript Functions\nAs demonstrated in main.tsx, ExtendScript functions can be called with the evalES() function that will append your panel's namespace in the background to avoid namespace clashes. If you wish to skip this scoping and call a global function directly, simply pass true to the second parameter.\n\n## Getting Started\nTo try out Bolt CEP for yourself, head over to the GitHub and clone the repo and follow the QuickStart and Config steps to get up and running.(no content)If you have questions with getting started using Bolt CEP, feel free to ask and discuss in the free Discord community.\n\n## Additional Resources for Premiere Pro\n\nMultiple Premiere Pro tools have been built using Bolt CEP, including captioning tools like Captioneer, which utilized Bolt CEP leading to a \"way faster development process.\"(no content)In order for CEP Extensions to get information or send commands to the host application, such as After Effects or Premiere Pro, they must call functions in the ExtendScript layer.\n\nWould you like more specific information about any aspect of the Bolt CEP configuration or setup process?\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"f34472e2-4c27-4198-b290-05dd5cfcd89a","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:33:04.367Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"Bolt CEP\" Premiere Pro configuration setup tutorial","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01EubJ8fLGxzraQ9qVSvDseX","content":[{"title":"Building Adobe Extensions — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/building-adobe-extensions/"},{"title":"Bolt CEP — Resources | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/resources/bolt-cep/"},{"title":"GitHub - hyperbrew/bolt-cep: A lightning-fast framework for building Adobe CEP Extensions in Svelte, React, or Vue built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass","url":"https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-cep"},{"title":"Bolt CEP | Build Extensions Faster — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/bolt-cep-build-extensions-faster/"},{"title":"Develop Your First Premiere Pro Extension: A Step-by-Step Guide","url":"https://vakago-tools.com/develop-your-first-premiere-pro-extension-a-step-by-step-guide/"},{"title":"autoEdit Adobe CEP Panel dev setup | autoEdit 2 Documentation","url":"https://autoedit.gitbook.io/documentation/adobe-panel/autoedit-adobe-cep-panel-dev-setup"},{"title":"bolt-cep - npm","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/bolt-cep/v/0.3.0"},{"title":"how to install the CEP extension properly · Issue #47 · Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/issues/47"},{"title":"Bolt CEP | Build Extensions Faster | by Hyper Brew | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@hyperbrew/bolt-cep-build-extensions-faster-feb905ac42d0"},{"title":"GitHub - hyperbrew/bolt-uxp: A lightning-fast boilerplate for building Adobe UXP Plugins in Svelte, React, or Vue built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass","url":"https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp"}]},"Here are the search results for \"Bolt CEP\" Premiere Pro configuration setup tutorial:\n\n## Bolt CEP Overview\n\nBolt CEP is a lightning-fast boilerplate for building Adobe CEP Extensions in Svelte, React, or Vue built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass.(no content)Bolt CEP is 100% free and open source, being released under the MIT license with no attribution required.

Let me compile this into a thorough research report.\n\n# Adobe CEP and UXP Panel Development for Premiere Pro\n\n**Documented for:** CEP 12, UXP for Premiere Pro (beta as of late 2025)\n\n---\n\n## 1. CEP vs UXP - Which to Use for Premiere Pro in 2024/2025\n\n### Current Status (Late 2025)\n\n**UXP is the future, but CEP remains viable for now:**\n\n| Platform | Status | Recommended For |\n|----------|--------|-----------------|\n| **CEP** | Fully supported through at least September 2026 | Production extensions, existing projects, full feature access |\n| **UXP** | Beta in Premiere Pro 25.6+ | New development, forward-looking projects |\n\n### Key Timeline Information\n\n- **UXP official release:** Expected before end of 2025 with near 1:1 parity to ExtendScript capabilities\n- **CEP deprecation:** Adobe committed to a ~1.75 year overlap period (similar to Flex-to-CEP transition)\n- **ExtendScript support:** Continuing through September 2026\n- **UXP requirement:** Currently requires Premiere Pro BETA builds\n\n### Recommendation\n\n**For immediate production needs:** Use CEP with Bolt CEP framework. CEP is mature, well-documented, and has full feature access.\n\n**For new projects with longer timelines:** Consider UXP if you can work with beta builds. Adobe is actively adding APIs (track items, .mogrt support, undo groupings, effects application).\n\n---\n\n## 2. React/Vue Integration with Adobe Panels\n\n### Bolt CEP - The Modern Standard\n\n[Bolt CEP](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-cep) is the recommended framework for modern CEP development, officially endorsed by Adobe's CEP-Resources repository.\n\n**Installation:**\n```bash\n# Using Yarn (recommended)\nyarn create bolt-cep\n\n# Using NPM\nnpx create-bolt-cep\n\n# Using PNPM\npnpm create bolt-cep\n```\n\n**Supported Frameworks:**\n- React + TypeScript\n- Vue + TypeScript\n- Svelte + TypeScript\n\n**Key Features:**\n- Vite-powered builds (10-100x faster than webpack)\n- Hot Module Replacement (HMR)\n- Type-safe ExtendScript communication via `evalTS()`\n- Multi-panel support\n- Built-in ZXP packaging\n- GitHub Actions workflows for releases\n\n### Project Structure\n```\nsrc/\n  js/\n    [panelName]/\n      main.tsx       # React/Vue entry point\n  jsx/\n    index.ts         # ExtendScript functions\ncep.config.ts        # Panel configuration\n```\n\n### Configuration (`cep.config.ts`)\n```typescript\nexport default {\n  id: \"com.company.extension\",\n  displayName: \"My Extension\",\n  version: \"1.0.0\",\n  hosts: [\n    { name: \"PPRO\", version: \"[22.0,99.9]\" }  // Premiere Pro\n  ],\n  panels: {\n    main: {\n      name: \"Main Panel\",\n      root: \"./src/js/main/index.html\",\n      // ... panel config\n    }\n  }\n};\n```\n\n### Bolt UXP (For UXP Development)\n\n[Bolt UXP](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp) provides the same modern workflow for UXP plugins:\n\n```bash\nyarn create bolt-uxp\n```\n\n**Supported Adobe apps:** Photoshop, InDesign, Premiere Pro (beta)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Drag and Drop Implementation in CEP Panels\n\n### Dragging FROM Panel TO Premiere Pro\n\nThis is the well-supported direction. Use the `com.adobe.cep.dnd.file.X` data transfer property:\n\n```javascript\n// In your panel JavaScript\nelement.addEventListener('dragstart', (event) => {\n  // Single file\n  event.dataTransfer.setData('com.adobe.cep.dnd.file.0', '/path/to/local/file.mp4');\n  \n  // Multiple files\n  event.dataTransfer.setData('com.adobe.cep.dnd.file.0', '/path/to/file1.mp4');\n  event.dataTransfer.setData('com.adobe.cep.dnd.file.1', '/path/to/file2.mp4');\n});\n```\n\n**Important:** Files must be local. For remote assets, download first, then set the local path.\n\n### Dragging FROM Premiere Pro TO Panel\n\n**Not supported.** The `event.dataTransfer` object is empty when dragging from Premiere Pro to a CEP panel.\n\n### Dragging FROM OS (Finder/Explorer) TO Panel\n\nStandard HTML5 drag and drop works:\n\n```javascript\ndropzone.addEventListener('dragover', (e) => {\n  e.preventDefault();\n});\n\ndropzone.addEventListener('drop', (e) => {\n  e.preventDefault();\n  const files = e.dataTransfer.files;\n  \n  for (let i = 0; i < files.length; i++) {\n    console.log('File path:', files[i].path);  // Node.js gives us .path\n  }\n});\n```\n\n### Application-Specific Notes\n\n- **Premiere Pro:** Full support for `com.adobe.cep.dnd.file.X`\n- **After Effects:** Limited drag-drop API support\n- **InDesign:** Only supports `text/plain` data type\n\n---\n\n## 4. Communication Between Panel UI and ExtendScript\n\n### Traditional CSInterface Pattern\n\n```javascript\n// Load CSInterface\nconst csInterface = new CSInterface();\n\n// Basic call (string-based, callback required)\ncsInterface.evalScript('myFunction(\"arg1\", \"arg2\")', (result) => {\n  console.log('Result:', result);\n});\n```\n\n### Promise Wrapper Pattern (Recommended)\n\n```javascript\n// Utility function\nfunction evalScript(script) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    const csInterface = new CSInterface();\n    csInterface.evalScript(script, (result) => {\n      if (result === 'EvalScript error.') {\n        reject(new Error('ExtendScript error'));\n      } else {\n        resolve(result);\n      }\n    });\n  });\n}\n\n// Usage with async/await\nasync function getProjectName() {\n  const result = await evalScript('app.project.name');\n  return result;\n}\n```\n\n### Bolt CEP's Type-Safe evalTS()\n\nBolt CEP provides `evalTS()` for type-safe ExtendScript communication:\n\n```typescript\n// In panel JavaScript (React/Vue/Svelte)\nimport { evalTS } from '../lib/utils/bolt';\n\n// Type-safe call - TypeScript validates function name and arguments\nconst result = await evalTS('getSequenceInfo', sequenceId);\n```\n\n```typescript\n// In ExtendScript (src/jsx/index.ts)\nexport function getSequenceInfo(sequenceId: string) {\n  const sequence = app.project.sequences[sequenceId];\n  return JSON.stringify({\n    name: sequence.name,\n    duration: sequence.end\n  });\n}\n```\n\n### Platform Behavior Warning\n\n**Critical:** `evalScript` behaves differently across platforms:\n- **Windows:** Asynchronous (as expected)\n- **macOS:** Synchronous but still requires callback for return values\n\n### Best Practices\n\n1. **Minimize ExtendScript calls** - Do calculations in JavaScript layer\n2. **Batch operations** - Group related calls to reduce overhead\n3. **Use JSON** - Serialize complex data for transfer\n4. **Handle errors** - ExtendScript lacks modern error handling\n\n```typescript\n// ExtendScript with JSON return\nfunction getProjectData() {\n  try {\n    return JSON.stringify({\n      success: true,\n      data: { name: app.project.name }\n    });\n  } catch (e) {\n    return JSON.stringify({\n      success: false,\n      error: e.toString()\n    });\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Debugging and Testing Workflows\n\n### Setup Requirements\n\n**1. Enable PlayerDebugMode**\n\n**Windows:**\n```\nRegistry: HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Adobe\\CSXS.12\nAdd String: PlayerDebugMode = 1\n```\n\n**macOS:**\n```bash\ndefaults write com.adobe.CSXS.12 PlayerDebugMode 1\n```\n\nOr use [aescripts ZXP Installer](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer/) > Settings > Debug > Enable Debugging\n\n**2.
