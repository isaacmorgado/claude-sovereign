At the heart of the partnership is NVIDIA's Music Flamingo technology, which provides tools to analyze, describe, and share music with unprecedented depth.\n\nUniversal Music Group and the creation platform Splice are collaborating on the next generation of AI-powered music creation tools. Additionally, UMG inked deals with AI music platform KLAY and AI-powered music creation platform Splice to develop AI-powered music tools, in November and December, respectively.\n\n## Key 2026 Product Launches\n\nUMG settled its copyright infringement lawsuit against AI music platform Udio, with the companies agreeing to collaborate on a new licensed AI music platform slated to launch in 2026. In 2026, Suno will release a new version of its model, trained only on licensed material, and it will retire its current model, which has not licensed its training data.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nThe deals point towards what's likely to be a significant AI-music trend in 2026: the evolution of GenAI music services into tools more akin to the software already used by professional musicians.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6d993c28-3783-4467-8432-5b5414d010ec","timestamp":"2026-01-14T05:09:21.760Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"music AI tools 2026 beta launch announcements emerging","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01ABAAQwaQMvjB4Ygog5s2vb","content":[{"title":"UMG & Splice To Collaborate On Next Generation Of AI-Powered Music Creation Tools -

At the heart of the partnership is NVIDIA's Music Flamingo technology, which provides tools to analyze, describe, and share music with unprecedented depth.\n\nUniversal Music Group and the creation platform Splice are collaborating on the next generation of AI-powered music creation tools. Additionally, UMG inked deals with AI music platform KLAY and AI-powered music creation platform Splice to develop AI-powered music tools, in November and December, respectively.\n\n## Key 2026 Product Launches\n\nUMG settled its copyright infringement lawsuit against AI music platform Udio, with the companies agreeing to collaborate on a new licensed AI music platform slated to launch in 2026. In 2026, Suno will release a new version of its model, trained only on licensed material, and it will retire its current model, which has not licensed its training data.\n\n## Industry Trends\n\nThe deals point towards what's likely to be a significant AI-music trend in 2026: the evolution of GenAI music services into tools more akin to the software already used by professional musicians."],"durationSeconds":9.262748541000008},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"21461441-63bf-4b0d-bbb9-e222fbe3fe23"}
