Here's a summary of the findings:\n\n## Export Format Support (MP3, WAV, Stems)\n\nAIVA supports exporting in MIDI, MP3, WAV, and stems, making it versatile for DAW integration. Users can export tracks in various formats including MP3, WAV, and as separate STEM packs with individual instrument tracks and MIDI files.\n\nFor Suno specifically, Suno allows users to extract up to 12 time-aligned WAV stems, which can be used seamlessly in DAWs like Ableton, Logic, or any other professional workflow.\n\n## Key Platforms and Features (2025)\n\nHigh-quality audio export formats, including WAV or stem tracks are considered important criteria when selecting tools.
