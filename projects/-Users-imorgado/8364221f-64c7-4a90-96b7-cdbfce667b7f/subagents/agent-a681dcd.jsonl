For serious creators, the Premier plan is approximately $24 per month and grants access to 10,000 monthly credits along with priority support.\n\nSuno also offers flexible yearly pricing plans that allow users to save 20% on their subscription fees. Annual plans cost as low as $7.30/month when billed yearly, while quarterly options are $11.60/month.\n\n## Key Features\n\nThe latest version, Suno v5, delivers studio-quality audio (the same as CDs), supports songs up to 8 minutes long, and includes pro editing tools where you can split songs into 12 different parts, like separating vocals from instruments.\n\nSuno is a platform that empowers users to create original songs using artificial intelligence by entering a simple text prompt to generate full tracks that include lyrics, vocals, and musical arrangements.\n\n## Commercial Use\n\nThe free plan has a catch where Suno owns songs you make and you can't sell or use them for business; however, paid plans allow you to own the music and use it however you want, including for commercial purposes.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"86c42535-c525-4a89-9257-52468622da3e","timestamp":"2026-01-14T05:09:30.972Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Suno AI music generator pricing features 2026","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01WCsJPqzjahuHm7Y7zrvPBA","content":[{"title":"Suno | Pricing","url":"https://suno.com/pricing"},{"title":"Suno AI Music Pricing | SunoCC.com","url":"https://sunocc.com/pricing"},{"title":"Suno AI: Suno AI Pricing Plans | Subscription","url":"https://sunnoai.com/pricing/"},{"title":"Suno AI Review 2025: Is Suno AI Worth It?

For serious creators, the Premier plan is approximately $24 per month and grants access to 10,000 monthly credits along with priority support.\n\nSuno also offers flexible yearly pricing plans that allow users to save 20% on their subscription fees. Annual plans cost as low as $7.30/month when billed yearly, while quarterly options are $11.60/month.\n\n## Key Features\n\nThe latest version, Suno v5, delivers studio-quality audio (the same as CDs), supports songs up to 8 minutes long, and includes pro editing tools where you can split songs into 12 different parts, like separating vocals from instruments.\n\nSuno is a platform that empowers users to create original songs using artificial intelligence by entering a simple text prompt to generate full tracks that include lyrics, vocals, and musical arrangements.\n\n## Commercial Use\n\nThe free plan has a catch where Suno owns songs you make and you can't sell or use them for business; however, paid plans allow you to own the music and use it however you want, including for commercial purposes."],"durationSeconds":9.16734745900001},"sourceToolAssistantUUID":"f9914200-3a4c-48f6-9757-0511a9cd8545"}
