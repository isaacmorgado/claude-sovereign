Additionally, Mubert Studio allows users to upload loops and samples to be used by the AI in future generations, making it particularly useful for musicians and producers who want to contribute their own content.\n\n**Soundraw:**\nThe search results don't indicate that Soundraw has a specific upload feature for images or audio samples. Users simply instruct the AI music generator on the kind of music they want by choosing their preferred genre, mood, theme, tempo, and track length, and Soundraw will generate dozens of tracks that match their description.\n\n**Amper Music:**\nThe search results don't mention specific upload features for Amper Music. Amper builds tracks from scratch with no pre-made loops in its library and no licensed material gets recycled, meaning content creators get unique compositions every time.\n\nIn summary, **Mubert stands out for its upload capabilities**, offering both image uploads for inspiration and the ability to upload loops and samples through Mubert Studio. Soundraw and Amper Music don't appear to offer these same upload features based on the available information.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"381892c6-bc79-4030-a3c6-ef9c2f2f5cd5","timestamp":"2026-01-14T05:09:19.053Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Mubert vs Soundraw vs Amper music upload features","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01CHHkPPdvYcBK945fVSgmzi","content":[{"title":"Best AI Music Generator Software in 2025","url":"https://www.audiocipher.com/post/ai-music-app"},{"title":"Comparing the Top AI Music Generators for Beginners","url":"https://vertu.com/ai-tools/top-ai-music-generation-tools-beginners/"},{"title":"8 Best AI Music Generators in 2024 - Geek Metaverse News","url":"https://www.geekmetaverse.com/best-ai-music-generators-in-2023/"},{"title":"Top 25 AI Tools For Musicians (2026) – KraftGeek","url":"https://kraftgeek.com/blogs/musician-guide/top-25-ai-tools-for-musicians-2025"},{"title":"7 Best AI Music Generators for Creators - SOUNDRAW Blog","url":"https://blog.soundraw.io/post/best-ai-music-generators-2024"},{"title":"Top 15 Suno AI Alternatives in 2025 for Music Creation","url":"https://www.biz4group.com/blog/sunoai-alternatives"},{"title":"Top 10 AI music generators- A comprehensive review - iFoto's Blog","url":"https://www.ifoto.ai/blog/ai-music-generator/"},{"title":"10 Best Soundraw Free Alternatives for AI Music Generation in 2025","url":"https://vozart.ai/blog/best-soundraw-free-alternatives"},{"title":"Mubert: AI Music Generator for Content Creators","url":"https://www.trendingaitools.com/ai-tools/mubert/"},{"title":"9 AI Music Generators You Need to Know About | AIM","url":"https://analyticsindiamag.com/9-ai-music-generators-you-need-to-know-about/"}]},{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01B6yASFfj3fHZ4DDgWbvbfX","content":[{"title":"Best AI Music Generator Software in 2025","url":"https://www.audiocipher.com/post/ai-music-app"},{"title":"Comparing the Top AI Music Generators for Beginners","url":"https://vertu.com/ai-tools/top-ai-music-generation-tools-beginners/"},{"title":"8 Best AI Music Generators in 2024 - Geek Metaverse News","url":"https://www.geekmetaverse.com/best-ai-music-generators-in-2023/"},{"title":"Top 25 AI Tools For Musicians (2026) – KraftGeek","url":"https://kraftgeek.com/blogs/musician-guide/top-25-ai-tools-for-musicians-2025"},{"title":"7 Best AI Music Generators for Creators - SOUNDRAW Blog","url":"https://blog.soundraw.io/post/best-ai-music-generators-2024"},{"title":"Top 15 Suno AI Alternatives in 2025 for Music Creation","url":"https://www.biz4group.com/blog/sunoai-alternatives"},{"title":"Top 10 AI music generators- A comprehensive review - iFoto's Blog","url":"https://www.ifoto.ai/blog/ai-music-generator/"},{"title":"10 Best Soundraw Free Alternatives for AI Music Generation in 2025","url":"https://vozart.ai/blog/best-soundraw-free-alternatives"},{"title":"Mubert: AI Music Generator for Content Creators","url":"https://www.trendingaitools.com/ai-tools/mubert/"},{"title":"9 AI Music Generators You Need to Know About | AIM","url":"https://analyticsindiamag.com/9-ai-music-generators-you-need-to-know-about/"}]},"Based on the web search results, here's a comparison of the upload features for these three AI music generators:\n\n## Upload Features Comparison\n\n**Mubert:**\nUsers can upload an image that illustrates the concept or mood of their song if they don't want to use a text prompt.
