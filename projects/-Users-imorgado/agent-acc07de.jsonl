This release represents a major step forward in modernizing Adobe's extensibility ecosystem.(no content)As of Premiere Pro 25.6 (November 2025), CEP extensions to Premiere Pro have been superseded by UXP Extensibility. If you are starting new development, you should start in UXP. CEP extensions continue to be supported, with the plan to support both CEP and UXP for a calendar year, after which Adobe will remove support for CEP extensibility.\n\n### CEP vs UXP Architecture\n\nCEP Extensions are comprised of a JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend built on Node.js + Chromium (similar to NW.js) and an ExtendScript backend for interacting with the host application. UXP Plugins are also JavaScript/HTML/CSS based, however they are built on Adobe's own unique stack which makes them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack. Additionally, instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has one unified environment for your frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction back and forth.\n\n### HTTP Server Communication with MCP\n\nFor communication between an MCP server and Premiere Pro, you need to install the CEP extension to allow communication. The UXP implementation is experimental and has fewer features than the CEP extension version.\n\n### Key Differences in Execution Model\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, blocking the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous and does not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition between the ExtendScript DOM and the UXP DOM, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### CEP Update Information\n\nCEP 12 shipped with Photoshop 25.12, Premiere Pro 25.0, and After Effects 25.0 (InDesign and Illustrator will come later). CEP 12 will be the last major update to CEP, although critical security issues will continue to be addressed.\n\n### Resources for Developers\n\nAdobe provides sample UXP plugins at https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples/tree/main, documentation at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/, and a PPro UXP Dev Forum at https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/c/uxp-for-premiere-pro/105.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6098d950-f2c2-41bd-8851-f4a4c3dca8eb","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:32:11.104Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe Premiere Pro UXP CEP extension HTTP server communication 2024 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Xd8pYe52PJaLQCP6Us9p2J","content":[{"title":"Updates for Creative Cloud Desktop Extensibility | by Padma Krishnamoorthy | Adobe Tech Blog | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/adobetech/updates-for-creative-cloud-desktop-extensibility-0dd5c663563e"},{"title":"Adobe Premiere Pro MCP server for AI agents","url":"https://playbooks.com/mcp/adobe-premiere-pro"},{"title":"Premiere Pro UXP Beta — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Extensions - To UXP or not to UXP - Adobe Product Community - 11326933","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-extensions-to-uxp-or-not-to-uxp/td-p/11326933"},{"title":"Solved: Full UXP support ETA - Adobe Product Community - 15352929","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/full-uxp-support-eta/td-p/15352929"},{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"Building Adobe Extensions — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/building-adobe-extensions/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro panels - Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/ReadMe.md"},{"title":"UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development"},{"title":"Premiere and UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/"}]},"Here are the search results for Adobe Premiere Pro UXP CEP extension HTTP server communication:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### UXP in Premiere Pro - Current Status\n\nThe Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP) has officially graduated from beta and is now available in Adobe Premiere 25.6.

CEP Panel with Node.js Child Process\nYou can access the command line from Premiere Pro through Node.js child process exec and execSync. You'll need a CEP panel with Node.js enabled, and then you can run commands to execute Python scripts.\n\nUsing 'node.js' and 'child_process' is the way to go if you want to run CLI commands in JavaScript. You need to go to your XML file and enable it.\n\n### 2. Pymiere - Python Library for Premiere Pro\nThe Pymiere Link extension is essentially a node.js server which receives the ExtendScript code and executes it within Premiere Pro. Where required, Pymiere Link will return data as a JSON encoded response back to Pymiere.(no content)Pymiere includes a mirror of all Premiere Pro ExtendScript objects in Python which were autogenerated from the ExtendScript objects interface.(no content)You must have Premiere Pro running for Pymiere to work - it can't run \"headlessly\".\n\n### 3. CEP Architecture Overview\nIn order for CEP Extensions to get information or send commands to the host application, such as After Effects or Premiere Pro, they must call functions in the ExtendScript layer.(no content)Debugging the JavaScript Layer (Chromium + Node.js) is accomplished with Chrome Dev Tools.(no content)It's important to note that CEP Extensions are in the process of being replaced with UXP extensions (aka UXP Plugins), which no longer use ExtendScript or Node.js, but instead use Adobe's own updated builds of JavaScript and HTML.\n\n### 4. PremiereRemote - WebSocket/HTTP Approach\nSince the release of v2.1.0, a WebSocket server was added to PremiereRemote. This enables you to trigger CEP code with minimal delay, e.g., when integrating PremiereRemote with Controller Hardware like the Elgato Stream Deck +.(no content)Any function that can be called via HTTP can also be called via WebSocket using port 8082 by default.\n\n### 5. General Node.js-Python Bridge Libraries\n- **JSPyBridge**: You can operate on objects on the other side of the bridge as if the objects existed on your side. This is achieved through real interop support: you can call callbacks, and do loss-less function calls with any arguments you like.\n\n- **python-bridge (npm)**: Evaluates Python code, returning the value back to Node.

CEP Panel with Node.js Child Process\nYou can access the command line from Premiere Pro through Node.js child process exec and execSync. You'll need a CEP panel with Node.js enabled, and then you can run commands to execute Python scripts.\n\nUsing 'node.js' and 'child_process' is the way to go if you want to run CLI commands in JavaScript. You need to go to your XML file and enable it.\n\n### 2. Pymiere - Python Library for Premiere Pro\nThe Pymiere Link extension is essentially a node.js server which receives the ExtendScript code and executes it within Premiere Pro. Where required, Pymiere Link will return data as a JSON encoded response back to Pymiere.(no content)Pymiere includes a mirror of all Premiere Pro ExtendScript objects in Python which were autogenerated from the ExtendScript objects interface.(no content)You must have Premiere Pro running for Pymiere to work - it can't run \"headlessly\".\n\n### 3. CEP Architecture Overview\nIn order for CEP Extensions to get information or send commands to the host application, such as After Effects or Premiere Pro, they must call functions in the ExtendScript layer.(no content)Debugging the JavaScript Layer (Chromium + Node.js) is accomplished with Chrome Dev Tools.(no content)It's important to note that CEP Extensions are in the process of being replaced with UXP extensions (aka UXP Plugins), which no longer use ExtendScript or Node.js, but instead use Adobe's own updated builds of JavaScript and HTML.\n\n### 4. PremiereRemote - WebSocket/HTTP Approach\nSince the release of v2.1.0, a WebSocket server was added to PremiereRemote. This enables you to trigger CEP code with minimal delay, e.g., when integrating PremiereRemote with Controller Hardware like the Elgato Stream Deck +.(no content)Any function that can be called via HTTP can also be called via WebSocket using port 8082 by default.\n\n### 5. General Node.js-Python Bridge Libraries\n- **JSPyBridge**: You can operate on objects on the other side of the bridge as if the objects existed on your side. This is achieved through real interop support: you can call callbacks, and do loss-less function calls with any arguments you like.\n\n- **python-bridge (npm)**: Evaluates Python code, returning the value back to Node. Pipes going into the Python process, separate from execution & evaluation. This can be used to stream data between processes, without buffering.\n\n- **UNIX Sockets**: UNIX sockets can be used where a socket server written for Node.js can successfully communicate with Python scripts.\n\n### Key Resources\n- **Pymiere**: https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere\n- **PremiereRemote**: https://github.com/sebinside/PremiereRemote\n- **JSPyBridge**: https://github.com/extremeheat/JSPyBridge\n- **python-bridge npm package**: https://www.npmjs.com/package/python-bridge"],"durationSeconds":27.906051749999985}}

Starting from CEP 4.0, HTML/CSS and JavaScript (ECMAScript 5) can be used to develop extensions.\n\n## Current CEP Versions\n\nCEP 12 is available for developing extensions and add-ons in latest versions of Creative Cloud Applications. Refer to the table for Creative Cloud products integration with CEP 12.\n\n## Extension Types\n\nThe Panel type behaves like any other application panel. It can be docked, participates in workspaces, has fly-out menus, and is re-opened at start-up if open at shutdown.(no content)A Modal Dialog type opens a new extension window and forces the user to interact only with the extension window before returning control to the host application. User can interact with host application only after closing extension window.(no content)A Modeless Dialog type opens a new extension window but doesn't force the user to interact with the extension window.\n\n## Architecture & Development\n\nCEP HTML engine is based on Chromium Embedded Framework version 3 (CEF3).(no content)You need to download the latest version of CEP's CSInterface.js library, which enables you to control the extension and communicate with the application. You can include this library wherever you like within your codebase, as long as you include it as a `<script>` dependency in your index.html file.(no content)Your CSInterface instance will give you access to methods and properties useful for building your extension. One of those methods, evalScript(), will let you communicate from your client-side JavaScript to your ExtendScript code and back.\n\n## ExtendScript Communication\n\nWhile this JavaScript layer of CEP is up-to-date and flexible to use, unfortunately when it comes to communicating with the host application, ExtendScript is still needed. In order for CEP Extensions to get information or send commands to the host application, such as After Effects or Premiere Pro, they must call functions in the ExtendScript layer.(no content)ExtendScript is Adobe's custom flavor of JavaScript, which is based off of the much older ES3 version of JavaScript (released in 1999). This means the latest ES6 features such as arrow functions, the const and let keywords, modern array functions, and more are not available.\n\n## Modern Development with Bolt CEP\n\nBolt CEP allows you to write Modern ES6 in both the JavaScript and ExtendScript layers, choose Svelte, React, or Vue for your frontend framework, and get type-safe ExtendScript with Types-for-Adobe.(no content)It supports Adobe CC Apps version 2024 or later on Windows, Mac Intel, and Mac Arm64 (M1-M4).\n\n## Future: UXP Extensions\n\nIt's important to note that CEP Extensions are in the process of being replaced with UXP extensions (aka UXP Plugins), which no longer use ExtendScript or Node.js, but instead use Adobe's own updated builds of JavaScript and HTML. At the time of this writing, Photoshop and XD are the only apps that run UXP panels. Adobe has made it clear that there will be a few years of overlap where both UXP and CEP are supported.\n\n## Key Resources\n- [Adobe CEP Resources on GitHub](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources)\n- [Getting Started Guides](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides)\n- [Bolt CEP Framework](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-cep) - Modern build tool for CEP extensions\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e3ba6eb9-4ff4-4a9b-b375-4fd5d86b2218","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:32:51.136Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe CEP panel architecture custom extensions HTML JavaScript 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_017UsLcbhBLYuGcukJ5poucY","content":[{"title":"GitHub - Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources: Tools and documentation for building Creative Cloud app extensions with CEP","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources"},{"title":"GitHub - Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides: Getting Started guides and samples for CEP extensions","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides"},{"title":"CEP-Resources/CEP_8.x/Documentation/CEP 8.0 HTML Extension Cookbook.md at master · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_8.x/Documentation/CEP 8.0 HTML Extension Cookbook.md"},{"title":"CEP-Resources/CEP_10.x/Documentation/CEP 10.0 HTML Extension Cookbook.md at master · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_10.x/Documentation/CEP 10.0 HTML Extension Cookbook.md"},{"title":"GitHub - hyperbrew/bolt-cep: A lightning-fast framework for building Adobe CEP Extensions in Svelte, React, or Vue built on Vite + TypeScript + Sass","url":"https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-cep"},{"title":"Extension SDK Documentation (CEP) — Photoshop Scripting Reference documentation","url":"https://theiviaxx.github.io/photoshop-docs/cep.html"},{"title":"CEP-Resources/CEP_9.x/Documentation/CEP 9.0 HTML Extension Cookbook.md at master · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_9.x/Documentation/CEP 9.0 HTML Extension Cookbook.md"},{"title":"CEP-Resources/CEP_11.x/Documentation/CEP 11.1 HTML Extension Cookbook.md at master · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_11.x/Documentation/CEP%2011.1%20HTML%20Extension%20Cookbook.md?plain=1"},{"title":"Enabling CEP extensions while working in Audition","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/audition/using/enabling-cep-extensions.html"},{"title":"Building Adobe Extensions — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/building-adobe-extensions/"}]},"Here's what I found about Adobe CEP panel architecture and custom extensions development with HTML/JavaScript:\n\n## Adobe CEP Overview\n\nCEP (formerly CSXS) Extensions extend the functionality of the Adobe point products in which they run.(no content)Extensions are loaded into applications through the PlugPlug Library architecture.

And you can emit one just as easily, via `Socket.emit('EventName', data)`.\n\n### Use Cases\n\nYou can make a panel that auto-starts when Premiere does and doesn't require any user input. It could either always run a certain action, or communicate with an external app to get instructions through a WebSocket.(no content)You can build a simple websocket connection to Adobe Premiere (or other Adobe apps) that will allow you to control certain features within your open application.(no content)You can control these features from anywhere with an internet connection and a browser.\n\n### Adobe CEP Samples\n\nAdobe provides official CEP samples that demonstrate using web sockets in an extension.

Luckily, CEP injects the `cep_node` object into the browser which allows you to load code into the Node.js context.\n\n### Client-Server Architecture\n\nFor a client-server architecture, you'll need to define two \"extensions\" in your manifest: one for the \"client\", and one for the \"server\". In your server manifest configuration, you'll need the `<Parameter>--enable-nodejs</Parameter>` setting.\n\n### Using http.createServer\n\nExample code for creating a basic Node.js HTTP server in CEP includes using `http.createServer` with code like:\n```javascript\nconst http = require('http');\nconst hostname = '127.0.0.1';\nconst port = 3000;\nconst server = http.createServer((req, res) => {\n  res.statusCode = 200;\n  res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');\n  res.end('Hello World\\n');\n});\n```\n\n### Express Server Setup\n\nYou can run an Express server in a CEP extension. This minimal extension implements a server-client infrastructure using Express and React.\n\n### Loading Node.js Modules\n\nNode runs in the same VM as JavaScript in your HTML panel. No setup is needed to call core libraries - just require them and use them. Calling external Node libraries works exactly the same as with built-in APIs.(no content)To add external libraries manually, just add the library to a folder called `node_modules` in your extension source.\n\n### Development Considerations\n\nSince you may run your Express server in a separate terminal for hot-reloading, you won't see logs from Chrome Debug Tools. This requires a separate entry point `index.server.dev.html` for your development setup that doesn't load the server into the Node.js context using the `cep_node` object.\n\n### Helpful Resources\n\n- Bolt-CEP is a popular modern framework choice for CEP development, supporting TypeScript, Vue3/React/Svelte.\n- The adobe-cep-react-create project bootstraps Adobe CC extensions with modern web technologies and native Node.js modules.\n\n### Known Issues\n\nSome native Node modules like 'node:events' may not be available in the CEP context, which can cause issues with certain npm packages.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b2b7a79c-4c48-481a-813f-226d5b66ce2c","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:34:11.085Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe CEP extension Node.js http.createServer express localhost API","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01PA74MrEPKkeKGhLCeuQSyc","content":[{"title":"Solved: How to enable Node.js in a CEP Extension - Adobe Product Community - 13780138","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/illustrator-discussions/how-to-enable-node-js-in-a-cep-extension/td-p/13780138"},{"title":"Using web technologies to build Adobe extensions | Theodo","url":"https://blog.theodo.com/2025/building-adobe-extensions/"},{"title":"CEP Guide Part 4: Working with Node.js | fenomas.com","url":"https://fenomas.com/2014/08/cep-5-node-js-en/"},{"title":"Solved: cannot get CSInterface to open extension server in... - Adobe Support Community - 10437661","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/cannot-get-csinterface-to-open-extension-server-invisibly-alongside-panel/td-p/10437661"},{"title":"CEP-Resources/CEP_8.x/Samples/CEP_HTML_Test_Extension-8.0/html/Nodejs.html at master · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_8.x/Samples/CEP_HTML_Test_Extension-8.0/html/Nodejs.html"},{"title":"Solved: Re: How to start node js server in CEP - Adobe Product Community - 15003371","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/how-to-start-node-js-server-in-cep/m-p/15004229"},{"title":"GitHub - HendrixString/adobe-cep-react-create: Create Adobe-CEP extension with React, Material-UI, Native Node modules, Webpack, Babel and ExtendScript","url":"https://github.com/HendrixString/adobe-cep-react-create"},{"title":"CEP Extension with Node.js not allowed to run on A... - Adobe Product Community - 12360236","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/exchange-discussions/cep-extension-with-node-js-not-allowed-to-run-on-after-effects-2020-by-apple-macos/td-p/12360236"},{"title":"Extension SDK Documentation (CEP) — Photoshop Scripting Reference documentation","url":"https://theiviaxx.github.io/photoshop-docs/cep.html"},{"title":"node.js error - cep_node.require(...) is not a function · Issue #435 · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/issues/435"}]},"Here are the search results for Adobe CEP extension Node.js http.createServer express localhost API:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Setting up Node.js in CEP Extensions\n\nThe setup for running Node.js in CEP is interesting: since the entry point to a CEP extension is always an index.html file, you need to load your Node.js app inside a browser.

Creating a Local HTTP Server for Premiere Pro Extensions\n\n**CEP (Legacy but Still Supported through Sept 2026):**\n\nYou can create an HTTP server within a CEP extension using Node.js. The architecture requires:\n\n1. Enable Node.js in your manifest.xml with `<Parameter>--enable-nodejs</Parameter>`\n2. Create a server extension (invisible) alongside your panel extension\n3. Load Node.js code through the `cep_node` object\n\n```javascript\n// Server entry point bootstrapping\nconst path = cep_node.require(\"path\");\nconst csInterface = new CSInterface();\nconst extensionRoot = csInterface.getSystemPath(SystemPath.EXTENSION);\ncep_node.require(path.join(extensionRoot, \"server\", \"main.js\"));\n```\n\n**UXP (New Standard for Premiere Pro 25.6+):**\n\nUXP supports `fetch()`, `XMLHttpRequest`, and `WebSocket` APIs for network communication. However, there's an important limitation: **only HTTPS is supported** (localhost HTTP won't work natively). You must declare domains in the manifest:\n\n```json\n\"requiredPermissions\": {\n  \"network\": {\n    \"domains\": [\"https://yourdomain.com\"]\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 2. Bridging Extensions with External Processes (Python, Node.js)\n\n**Option A: Pymiere (Python to Premiere Pro)**\n- GitHub: [github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere](https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere)\n- Architecture: Python commands are converted to ExtendScript, sent via HTTP to a Node.js server (Pymiere Link extension), executed in Premiere Pro, and results returned as JSON\n- Limitation: Premiere Pro must be running (no headless operation)\n\n**Option B: PremiereRemote (HTTP/WebSocket API)**\n- GitHub: [github.com/sebinside/PremiereRemote](https://github.com/sebinside/PremiereRemote)\n- HTTP Server: Port 8081 (default)\n- WebSocket Server: Port 8082 (default)\n- Swagger UI: `http://localhost:8081/api-docs/`\n- Triggering functions:\n  - HTTP: `http://localhost:8081/functionName?param1=value1`\n  - WebSocket: `ws.send('functionName,param1Value,param2Value')`\n\n**Option C: CEP Child Process**\nUsing Node.js `child_process` module in CEP to spawn Python or other executables:\n```javascript\nconst { exec } = require('child_process');\nexec('python /path/to/script.py', (error, stdout, stderr) => {\n  // handle output\n});\n```\n\n**Option D: Socket.io / WebSocket**\nSet up WebSocket listeners in your CEP panel that communicate with external applications:\n```javascript\nSocket.on('EventName', (data) => {\n  // Execute ExtendScript based on received data\n});\nSocket.emit('ResponseEvent', responseData);\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. Existing Frameworks for Custom Premiere Pro APIs\n\n| Framework | Type | Description |\n|-----------|------|-------------|\n| **PremiereRemote** | CEP | HTTP + WebSocket server with auto-generated API docs |\n| **Pymiere** | Python Library | Full ExtendScript object mirror in Python |\n| **Bolt CEP** | Build Tool | Modern TypeScript/React/Vue framework with `evalTS()` for type-safe ExtendScript calls |\n| **Adobe-CEP Samples** | Official | Reference implementations including PProPanel |\n| **MCP Server for Premiere** | AI Integration | Model Context Protocol server for AI agents |\n\n**Bolt CEP** ([github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-cep](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-cep)) is recommended for modern development:\n- ES6+ syntax in both JavaScript and ExtendScript layers\n- Type-safe ExtendScript calls with `evalTS()`\n- Bidirectional communication with `listenTS()` and `dispatchTS()`\n- Automatic Node.js module bundling\n\n---\n\n### 4. Adobe Panel Architecture for Custom Extensions\n\n**CEP Architecture (Legacy):**\n- Built on NW.js (Chromium + Node.js)\n- Two-layer system: JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend + ExtendScript backend\n- Communication via `CSInterface.evalScript()` method\n- Panel types: Panel (dockable), Modal Dialog, Modeless Dialog\n- Extension location: `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/` (Mac)\n\n**UXP Architecture (Current - Premiere Pro 25.6+):**\n- Unified JavaScript engine (no ExtendScript bridge needed)\n- Direct access to both UXP Core APIs and Premiere DOM APIs\n- Lighter weight than CEP (no Chromium overhead)\n- All API calls are asynchronous (unlike synchronous ExtendScript)\n- Access via `require()` modules\n\n```javascript\n// UXP example\nconst premiere = require('premiere');\nconst project = await premiere.project.getActiveProject();\n```\n\n**Timeline:**\n- CEP and UXP will be supported concurrently for approximately one calendar year (through ~Sept 2026)\n- New development should use UXP\n- CEP 12 is the final major CEP version\n\n---\n\n### 5. IPC Methods That Work Best with Premiere Pro\n\n**Recommended IPC Methods (by reliability):**\n\n1. **WebSocket** - Best for real-time, bidirectional communication\n   - Low latency (suitable for hardware controllers like Stream Deck)\n   - Persistent connection\n   - Supported in both CEP (via Node.js) and UXP\n\n2. **HTTP/REST** - Best for request-response patterns\n   - Works in CEP via Express/Node.js\n   - UXP supports via `fetch()` (HTTPS only)\n   - Good for external tool integration\n\n3. **Named Pipes / Unix Sockets** - Platform-specific, low-level\n   - Available through Node.js in CEP\n   - Good for local-only communication\n\n4. **Child Process** - For spawning external scripts\n   - `child_process.exec()` or `spawn()` in CEP\n   - Good for Python, shell scripts, CLI tools\n\n**Not Recommended:**\n- Shared memory (complex, not supported in extension contexts)\n- File-based IPC (slow, requires polling)\n\n---\n\n### Key Implementation Example: PremiereRemote Architecture\n\n```typescript\n// Define functions in host/index.tsx that become API endpoints\nconst host = {\n  getSequenceList: () => {\n    // ExtendScript to get sequences\n    return app.project.sequences;\n  },\n  exportToAME: (sequenceName: string, preset: string) => {\n    // Queue export\n  }\n};\n```\n\nAccess via:\n- HTTP: `GET http://localhost:8081/getSequenceList`\n- WebSocket: `ws://localhost:8082` then send `getSequenceList`\n\n---\n\n### Sources\n\n- [Adobe UXP for Premiere Pro Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Premiere API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [Pymiere - Python for Premiere Pro](https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere)\n- [PremiereRemote - HTTP/WebSocket Framework](https://github.com/sebinside/PremiereRemote)\n- [Bolt CEP Framework](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-cep)\n- [Adobe CEP Resources](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources)\n- [Adobe CEP Getting Started Guides](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides)\n- [PProPanel Sample](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/ReadMe.md)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro Samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [UXP in Premiere Announcement](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n- [Building Adobe Extensions - Theodo](https://blog.theodo.com/2025/building-adobe-extensions/)\n- [PremiereOnScript - WebSocket Tutorial](https://premiereonscript.com/control-premiere-remotely-with-websockets/)\n- [Hyper Brew - Building Adobe Extensions](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/building-adobe-extensions/)\n- [UXP Network APIs - InDesign (similar to Premiere)](https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/resources/recipes/network/)\n- [Photoshop UXP Network I/O Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/network-io/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1092,"cache_read_input_tokens":26110,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1092,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWJpCpoqgdNwPejmdqfLQ","type":"assistant","uuid":"1bc42c88-24f7-452e-b6e7-9f49a021d74b","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:35:13.067Z"}
