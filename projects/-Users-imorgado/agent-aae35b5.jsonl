I'm ready to help you explore your codebase and design implementation plans for the Suno Premiere Pro Plugin project. Based on the context, this is an AI-powered music generation plugin for Adobe Premiere Pro with a web app backend integration.\n\nThe project appears to be in the research/planning phase with architecture decisions made around:\n- CEP plugin approach (with Bolt CEP build tool)\n- NestJS backend with BullMQ for job queues\n- Cloudflare R2 for storage\n- SSE for real-time communication\n- OAuth 2.0 Device Flow for authentication\n\nWhat would you like me to explore or help plan? I can:\n\n1. Investigate existing patterns in your codebase\n2. Design implementation plans for specific components\n3. Research how to structure the monorepo\n4. Plan the backend API skeleton\n5. Design the audio analysis pipeline architecture\n6. Plan the CEP panel UI structure\n\nJust let me know what aspect you'd like to focus on, and I'll explore the codebase and provide a detailed implementation plan."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1593,"cache_creation_input_tokens":0,"cache_read_input_tokens":0,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":0,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWDDzLxDermgjUDcEwyoM","type":"assistant","uuid":"4e3ac844-865e-43ac-9bec-88e4f2746424","timestamp":"2025-12-18T00:42:50.978Z"}
