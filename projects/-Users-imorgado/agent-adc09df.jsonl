It enables conversation continuity, cross-model workflows, and strategic delegation of tasks like code reviews, planning, and debugging, all while keeping your CLI in charge of the workflow.(no content)PAL MCP (Provider Abstraction Layer – Model Context Protocol) acts as an intelligent \"connectivity layer\" and \"command center.\" It empowers you to flexibly mobilize and coordinate multiple AI models through your favorite CLI tool (like Claude Code, Codex CLI, or Gemini CLI) to tackle complex development problems together.\n\n## Key Features with Gemini Integration\n\nMulti-Model Orchestration allows Claude to coordinate with Gemini Pro, O3, GPT-5, and 50+ other models to get the best analysis for each task. It also offers Extended Context Windows that break Claude's limits by delegating to Gemini (1M tokens) or O3 (200K tokens) for massive codebases.(no content)You can use the CLI you love (Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Codex CLI, Qwen Code CLI, Cursor, and more) with multiple models within a single prompt including Gemini, OpenAI, Anthropic, Grok, Azure, Ollama, and OpenRouter. Claude Code can spawn Codex subagents, Codex can spawn Gemini CLI subagents, etc.\n\n## Recommended Model Pairings\n\nFor model pairings, Claude 3.5 Sonnet can serve as the Lead Architect/Orchestrator handling all agentic coordination and final decision-making, while Gemini 3.0 Pro or GPT-5-Pro serves as Chief Technical Expert/Auditor responsible for deep thinking, complex code reviews, debugging validation, and final pre-commit analysis.\n\n## Workflow Example\n\nIn a typical workflow, Claude performs the actual work of fixing highlighted issues, and when done, Claude returns to Gemini Pro for a precommit review—all within a single conversation thread. Gemini Pro in step 11 knows what was recommended by O3 in step 7, taking that context and review into consideration to aid with its final pre-commit review.\n\n## The clink Tool for CLI Orchestration\n\nThe clink tool transforms your CLI into a multi-agent orchestrator. It lets you launch isolated Codex instances from within Codex, delegate to Gemini's 1M context, or run specialized Claude agents—all while preserving conversation continuity. Instead of context-switching or token bloat, you can spawn fresh subagents that handle complex tasks in isolation and return only the results you need.\n\n## Installation\n\nPrerequisites include Python 3.10 or newer, Git, and uv (or an equivalent runtime). The recommended installation approach is to clone and use automatic setup: `git clone https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server.git` and then run `./run-server.sh`.\n\nThe GitHub repository is available at: https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e94ddf10-e18f-423a-b77f-991062732caa","timestamp":"2025-12-29T22:30:48.527Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"PAL MCP orchestration Gemini models","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01BRNHRngUkMxsewUbcyS9Eg","content":[{"title":"PAL MCP Server - playbooks","url":"https://playbooks.com/mcp/beehiveinnovations-gemini"},{"title":"PAL MCP Guide: Orchestrate Multiple AI Models (Claude, GPT-5, Gemini) to Supercharge Development | Efficient Coder","url":"https://www.xugj520.cn/en/archives/pal-mcp-guide-orchestrate-ai-models.html"},{"title":"GitHub - BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server: The power of Claude Code / GeminiCLI / CodexCLI + [Gemini / OpenAI / OpenRouter / Azure / Grok / Ollama / Custom Model / All Of The Above] working as one.","url":"https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server"},{"title":"PAL | Orchestrate AI Models for CLI Dev & Code Analysis","url":"https://mcpmarket.com/server/pal"},{"title":"PAL MCP: Many Workflows.

This allows Gemini 2.5 models (via Gemini CLI) to collaborate with OpenRouter-based models like OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, and others.\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe Gemini MCP server is a lightweight, local server that acts as a bridge, or an intelligent intermediary, between your Claude desktop application and the Google Gemini Pro API.(no content)The magic enabling this AI collaboration is the Model Context Protocol (MCP). In computing, a protocol is simply a standardized set of rules for communication. MCP is an open standard designed specifically to allow different AI models and development tools to talk to each other, sharing context and passing tasks back and forth.\n\n### Setup Guides Available\n\nThere are complete setup guides for integrating Google's Gemini CLI with Claude Code through an MCP server. This provides automatic second opinion consultation when Claude expresses uncertainty or encounters complex technical decisions.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- Start Collaborative Sessions to initiate new discussions with Gemini on a specific topic. Consult Gemini by asking questions or providing context within an ongoing collaboration. Retrieve Conversation History to access the full transcript of a collaborative session.\n\n- This creates a bridge between Claude Code and Google's Gemini AI models, giving you access to Gemini's powerful 1M+ token context window and latest AI capabilities directly within your Claude Code development environment.\n\n### Alternative Perspective\n\nGemini CLI now offers a Claude Code alternative experience at zero cost. MCP servers are taking it to the next level, bringing the barriers of entry to premium terminal AI coding to zero.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8256c078-322a-4108-87b2-afd4bdb87201","timestamp":"2025-12-29T22:30:48.789Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"MCP server Gemini CLI Claude Code integration","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01BUksKBnY2LbxW6yvnRL1ur","content":[{"title":"Gemini MCP: How to Use Gemini 2.5 Pro with Claude Code","url":"https://apidog.com/blog/gemini-mcp-claude-code/"},{"title":"GitHub - jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool: MCP server that enables AI assistants to interact with Google Gemini CLI, leveraging Gemini's massive token window for large file analysis and codebase understanding","url":"https://github.com/jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool"},{"title":"Gemini CLI Integration for Claude Code MCP Server","url":"https://gist.github.com/AshikNesin/f15e1bf564da5f72295f65b63f266fe7"},{"title":"GitHub - RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp: MCP Server that enables Claude code to interact with Gemini","url":"https://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp"},{"title":"Claude Code and Gemini CLI Integration · GitHub","url":"https://gist.github.com/shoveller/5b231d90b96af092fe64019d7ff45100"},{"title":"Claude-Gemini Collaborative Integration | MCP Servers · LobeHub","url":"https://lobehub.com/mcp/jamiewonderchild-claude-gemini-mcp"},{"title":"Claude Gemini MCP Integration | MCP Servers · LobeHub","url":"https://lobehub.com/mcp/cmdaltctr-claude-gemini-mcp-slim"},{"title":"How I‘m Using Gemini CLI + MCP Servers To Level Up to Claude Code (FREE Effective Alternative) | by Joe Njenga | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@joe.njenga/how-i-m-using-gemini-cli-mcp-servers-to-level-up-to-claude-code-free-effective-alternative-0020f5d2a721"},{"title":"Claude Code + Gemini MCP Server","url":"https://github.com/RaiAnsar/claude_code-gemini-mcp"},{"title":"GitHub - centminmod/gemini-cli-mcp-server","url":"https://github.com/centminmod/gemini-cli-mcp-server"}]},"Here are the results for your search on \"MCP server Gemini CLI Claude Code integration\":\n\n## Overview\n\nThere are several MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers available that enable integration between Google's Gemini CLI and Claude Code, allowing both AI systems to work together collaboratively.\n\n### Key Projects\n\n1. **RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp** (GitHub)\n   A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for integrating Google's Gemini models with Claude Code, enabling powerful collaboration between both AI systems.(no content)Features include Direct Query, Collaborative Brainstorming, Code Analysis, Text Analysis, Content Summarization, and Image Prompt Generation.(no content)This MCP server allows Claude to access Gemini's capabilities directly within your Claude Code environment.

This allows Gemini 2.5 models (via Gemini CLI) to collaborate with OpenRouter-based models like OpenAI GPT-4, Anthropic Claude, and others.\n\n### How It Works\n\nThe Gemini MCP server is a lightweight, local server that acts as a bridge, or an intelligent intermediary, between your Claude desktop application and the Google Gemini Pro API.(no content)The magic enabling this AI collaboration is the Model Context Protocol (MCP). In computing, a protocol is simply a standardized set of rules for communication. MCP is an open standard designed specifically to allow different AI models and development tools to talk to each other, sharing context and passing tasks back and forth.\n\n### Setup Guides Available\n\nThere are complete setup guides for integrating Google's Gemini CLI with Claude Code through an MCP server. This provides automatic second opinion consultation when Claude expresses uncertainty or encounters complex technical decisions.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- Start Collaborative Sessions to initiate new discussions with Gemini on a specific topic. Consult Gemini by asking questions or providing context within an ongoing collaboration. Retrieve Conversation History to access the full transcript of a collaborative session.\n\n- This creates a bridge between Claude Code and Google's Gemini AI models, giving you access to Gemini's powerful 1M+ token context window and latest AI capabilities directly within your Claude Code development environment.\n\n### Alternative Perspective\n\nGemini CLI now offers a Claude Code alternative experience at zero cost. MCP servers are taking it to the next level, bringing the barriers of entry to premium terminal AI coding to zero."],"durationSeconds":30.837134708000345}}

It leverages the existing AgentExecutor as the core runtime and the AgentDefinition as the blueprint for specialized agents. The architecture is modeled after a software development team.

I now have comprehensive research. Let me compile the findings into a well-organized report.\n\n## Comprehensive Research Report: Parallel Gemini Agents, MCP Servers, and Multi-Model Orchestration\n\nI've conducted a thorough search across GitHub, npm, documentation, and recent blog posts. Here's what I found:\n\n---\n\n### 1. SPAWNING MULTIPLE AI AGENTS IN PARALLEL WITH GEMINI\n\n#### Official Gemini CLI Subagents (In Development)\n- **Status**: Partially implemented, with active pull requests for enhanced parallel execution\n- **Key Feature**: Pull Request #4883 enables creation of specialized AI agents with task delegation, parallel execution, and independent contexts\n- **Current Limitation**: Tool calls execute sequentially; a feature request (Issue #14963) specifically asks for parallel subagent execution support\n- **Authentication**: Uses Google OAuth2 (no API key required) with secure token storage via MCPOAuthTokenStorage\n- **Free Tier**: 60 requests/minute, 1,000 requests/day with Google account login\n\n#### How Subagents Currently Work:\nWhen `/agents:run` is executed, Gemini CLI launches a new independent instance with a specific extension (e.g., `-e coder-agent`) in `--yolo` mode. Each agent operates with its own context window.\n\n#### Community Fork with Better Support:\n- **tudoanh/gemini-cli-subagents** (GitHub) - Community fork with built-in subagents and skills support, Gemini 2.5 Pro with 1M token context\n\n**Sources:**\n- [google-gemini/gemini-cli PR #4883 (Sub-Agents)](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/pull/4883)\n- [Parallel subagent execution feature request](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli/issues/14963)\n- [tudoanh/gemini-cli-subagents](https://github.com/tudoanh/gemini-cli-subagents)\n\n---\n\n### 2. MCP SERVERS WRAPPING GEMINI CLI FOR CLAUDE CODE INTEGRATION\n\n#### Primary MCP Projects\n\n**RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp** (Most Recommended)\n- Official MCP server integrating Gemini with Claude Code\n- One-line installation: `claude mcp add gemini`\n- Features: Direct Query, Collaborative Brainstorming, Code Analysis, Text Analysis, Summarization, Image Prompt Generation\n- Leverages Gemini's 1M+ token context window for large file analysis\n\n**jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool**\n- Focused on leveraging Gemini's massive token window for codebase analysis\n- Simpler alternative designed to save Claude tokens on large files\n- Acts as intelligent intermediary between Claude and Gemini Pro API\n\n**centminmod/gemini-cli-mcp-server**\n- Advanced implementation with 33 specialized MCP tools\n- Supports 400+ AI models via OpenRouter integration\n- Features multi-AI collaboration tool enabling Gemini to work with GPT-4, Claude, and others\n- Redis-backed conversation history storage\n\n#### How It Works:\nMCP acts as a bridge using the Model Context Protocol—standardized communication rules allowing different AI systems to share context and delegate tasks. This enables Claude Code to access Gemini's capabilities directly in the IDE.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Gemini MCP: How to Use Gemini 2.5 Pro with Claude Code](https://apidog.com/blog/gemini-mcp-claude-code/)\n- [RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp](https://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp)\n- [jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool](https://github.com/jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool)\n- [centminmod/gemini-cli-mcp-server](https://github.com/centminmod/gemini-cli-mcp-server)\n\n---\n\n### 3.
