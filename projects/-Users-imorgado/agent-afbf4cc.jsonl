It will not shift anything around, it will just place it on top and delete whatever was there before it. This can be accomplished through `app.project.activeSequence.videoTracks[x].overwriteClip(clip, timecode in seconds)`.(no content)If you would like to place the clip at the current player position, you can use:\n```javascript\nvar playerPosition = app.project.activeSequence.getPlayerPosition();\napp.project.activeSequence.videoTracks[x].overwriteClip(clip, playerPosition.seconds)\n```\nNote the `.seconds` after the player position timecode - this converts the time from TICKS to SECONDS.\n\n### Getting In/Out Points from Selected Clips\n\nYou can loop through a trackItemCollection and check for the `isSelected()` property. It returns a boolean, and if true, you can get the trackItem's both inPoint and outPoint.\n\n### Alternative Approaches\n\nMimicking in-timeline editing is not possible through ExtendScript as of today, but you can try to mimic classical 3-point editing through a script if your marker information is of such quality that you can calculate the time values for the source clips.(no content)One workaround is to select the current clip, create a subclip of it with the new in point, move it to a specific bin in the projects, then overwrite it on the track right next to the last clip.(no content)Another option is to perform editing outside of Premiere with shell scripts and create FCP XML sequences that you can import to Premiere afterwards.\n\n### Using createSubClip()\n\nWith `createSubClip()` you can split a piece of imported footage into as many sections as you want, and you can set In and Out points for each of them separately.\n\n### Nesting/Subsequences\n\nWhen working with sequences, you need to store the current inPoint and outPoint of the active sequence if you plan to change them, then get the start and end times of the selection to set new inPoint and outPoint values.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5ecc27b0-2599-4763-9757-531bc0a6bf8d","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:30:45.838Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro scripting add clips to timeline in out points ExtendScript","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_014nvuyR6EzQY6yWjbpThh7k","content":[{"title":"Solved: Editing clips with ExtendScript - Adobe Product Community - 9056625","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/editing-clips-with-extendscript/td-p/9056625"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting: Set In and Out Points of Clip","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-set-in-and-out-points-of-clip/td-p/10490225"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Scripting ExtendScript question - Adobe Product Community - 13379442","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-extendscript-question/td-p/13379442"},{"title":"How to Nest a Sequence using ExtendScript in Premiere Pro","url":"https://vakago-tools.com/how-to-nest-a-sequence-using-extendscript-in-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Using Adobe ExtendScript to Automate Video Editing in Premiere Pro","url":"https://metadesignsolutions.com/using-adobe-extendscript-to-automate-video-editing-in-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Solved: Selected clip in timeline? - Adobe Product Community - 8233928","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/selected-clip-in-timeline/td-p/8233928"},{"title":"Solved: Re: Premiere Pro Scripting ExtendScript question - Adobe Support Community - 13379442","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-extendscript-question/m-p/13380994"},{"title":"Having fun with the Active Sequence, Mute Tracks, Place Clips - PremiereOnScript","url":"https://premiereonscript.com/log-11/"},{"title":"Solved: Selected clip in timeline? - Adobe Support Community - 8233928","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/selected-clip-in-timeline/m-p/8233928"},{"title":"Re: Premiere Pro Scripting: Set In and Out Points of Clip","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-set-in-and-out-points-of-clip/m-p/10490227"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about adding clips to the timeline with in/out points using ExtendScript in Adobe Premiere Pro:\n\n## Key Methods for Adding Clips with In/Out Points\n\n### Setting In/Out Points Before Adding to Timeline\n\nThe recommended approach is to set the in/out points of the projectItem before you insert a clip into the sequence.(no content)The `setInPoint()` and `setOutPoint()` methods work in CC 2019 and later, but don't exist for project items in CC 2017.\n\n### Adding Clips to Timeline\n\nOverwriting a clip will place that clip in the timeline wherever you specify, with no regards to what was there before it.

ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.(no content)No further changes or improvements to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled. Any such changes will be reconsidered once Premiere Pro moves to UXP-based extensibility.\n\n### ExtendScript API Capabilities\nPremiere Pro provides an ExtendScript API, allowing for the access and manipulation of most project elements, including metadata, exporting and rendering options.\n\nThe API provides access to timeline elements such as:\nNew API to move a trackItem, and new APIs to set the disabled state of a trackItem.\n\n### Timeline Manipulation Limitations\nThere is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks.

So it would look like this: `app.project.rootItem.children[index].children[index]`.\n\n### Project Item Types\n\nThe `children` property is a `ProjectItemCollection` referencing the children (if any) of this item; only valid for bins. The type of the `projectItem` will be `BIN`, `CLIP`, `FILE` or `ROOT`.\n\n### Iterating Through Items\n\nYou can iterate through items using: `for (i = 0; i <= app.project.rootItem.children.numItems; i++)`.(no content)`getMediaPath()` returns undefined when your current item is a folder, sequence or title, so you need to do checks when iterating.\n\n### Example: Searching Bins Recursively\n\nHere's an example of searching through bins recursively:\n```javascript\nsearchBinForProjItemByName : function(i, currentItem, nameToFind){\n    for (var j = i; j < currentItem.children.numItems; j++){\n        var currentChild = currentItem.children;\n        if (currentChild.type == ProjectItemType.BIN){\n            return $._PPP_.searchBinForProjItemByName(0, currentChild, nameToFind);\n        } else if (currentChild.name == nameToFind){\n            return currentChild;\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Working with Bins\n\n`app.project.rootItem.children[index].createBin(name)` creates an empty bin within the project item. Only works within bins. Returns a project item representing the new bin if successful, or 0 if unsuccessful.(no content)`app.project.rootItem.children[index].moveBin(newParentBinProjectItem)` moves the projectItem into a new parent bin and returns 0 if move was successful.\n\n### Reference Resources\n\nFor a complete example, take a look at how PProPanel walks all project bins and items to dump their XMP; it checks whether bins have children. The sample code is available at https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/e60d6a22ef44d8eb4cca3904c35a0c050576b697/PProPanel/jsx/PPR...\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"a6b8f4b2-5a9d-4359-b6e5-777d1d9802d7","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:32:47.170Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro ExtendScript project rootItem children iterate clips bins example","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_018Hj916NYdu8LYX9fdoVhrA","content":[{"title":"Solved: Accessing clips inside bins using Extendscript - Adobe Product Community - 13761308","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/accessing-clips-inside-bins-using-extendscript/td-p/13761308"},{"title":"Samples/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx at master · Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx"},{"title":"ProjectItem object - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/item/projectitem/"},{"title":"Samples/TypeScript/PProPanel-vscode/payloads/api_doc.html at master · Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/TypeScript/PProPanel-vscode/payloads/api_doc.html"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Jsx functions for Adobe CEP autoEdit adobe Panel | autoEdit 2 Documentation","url":"https://autoedit.gitbook.io/documentation/adobe-panel/adobe-cep-jsx-functions-for-autoedit-adobe-panel"},{"title":"extendscript-starter/src/Premiere/index.ts at master · adobe-extension-tools/extendscript-starter","url":"https://github.com/adobe-extension-tools/extendscript-starter/blob/master/src/Premiere/index.ts"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro & ExtendScript - Adobe Product Community - 8637661","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-extendscript/m-p/8637661"},{"title":"ExtendScript: How to create a sequence directly to a specific bin?","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/extendscript-how-to-create-a-sequence-directly-to-a-specific-bin/td-p/14610357"},{"title":"Creating Bins, Sequences, and Moving them Around - PremiereOnScript","url":"https://premiereonscript.com/log-04/"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about iterating through Premiere Pro project items, clips, and bins using ExtendScript:\n\n## Accessing Project Items and Bins\n\nTo access items in the project window, you use `app.project.rootItem.children[index]`.\n\n### Accessing Items Inside Bins\n\nTo access clips inside bins, you need to add `.children` a second time.

ExtendScript integrations remain supported through September 2026, but no further improvements are planned. Consider this when starting new projects.\n\n---\n\n## 1. ExtendScript/JSX API Overview\n\n### Development Environment Setup\n\nExtendScript Toolkit (ESTK) is deprecated. The recommended approach:\n\n1. **Microsoft Visual Studio Code** with the **ExtendScript Debugger extension**\n2. Execute scripts via **CEP panels** (recommended) or place `.jsx` files in:\n   - Window > Utilities > Scripts > User Scripts folder\n\n### Core Objects Hierarchy\n\n```\napp.project\n├── rootItem (ProjectItem - root bin)\n│   └── children (ProjectItemCollection)\n├── sequences (SequenceCollection)\n│   └── activeSequence (Sequence)\n│       ├── videoTracks (TrackCollection)\n│       ├── audioTracks (TrackCollection)\n│       └── markers (MarkerCollection)\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Adding Clips to Timeline with In/Out Points\n\n### Method 1: Sequence-Level Insert/Overwrite\n\n```javascript\n// Insert clip - pushes existing clips forward\napp.project.activeSequence.insertClip(\n    projectItem,    // ProjectItem object\n    time,           // Time in ticks or seconds\n    vTrackIndex,    // Video track index (0-based)\n    aTrackIndex     // Audio track index (0-based)\n);\n\n// Overwrite clip - replaces existing content\napp.project.activeSequence.overwriteClip(\n    projectItem,\n    time,\n    vTrackIndex,\n    aTrackIndex\n);\n```\n\n### Method 2: Track-Level Insert/Overwrite\n\n```javascript\nvar seq = app.project.activeSequence;\nvar clip = app.project.rootItem.children[0]; // First project item\n\n// Insert at specific time (seconds)\nseq.videoTracks[0].insertClip(clip, 5.0);\n\n// Overwrite at player position\nvar playerPos = seq.getPlayerPosition();\nseq.videoTracks[0].overwriteClip(clip, playerPos.seconds);\n```\n\n### Setting In/Out Points Before Adding\n\n```javascript\n// Set source in/out points on the ProjectItem BEFORE inserting\nvar projectItem = app.project.rootItem.children[0];\n\n// Set in point at 2 seconds, out point at 10 seconds\nprojectItem.setInPoint(2.0, 4);  // 4 = update UI\nprojectItem.setOutPoint(10.0, 4);\n\n// Now insert - clip will use these in/out points\napp.project.activeSequence.videoTracks[0].insertClip(projectItem, 0);\n```\n\n### Creating Subclips with Specific In/Out Points\n\n```javascript\n// Create a subclip from source footage\nvar sourceClip = app.project.rootItem.children[0];\nvar subclip = sourceClip.createSubClip(\n    \"Subclip Name\",\n    startTime,      // Start time in ticks\n    endTime,        // End time in ticks\n    hasHardBounds,  // Boolean\n    destinationBin  // Optional: target bin ProjectItem\n);\n```\n\n### Modifying TrackItem In/Out Points (After Placement)\n\n```javascript\nvar seq = app.project.activeSequence;\nvar trackItem = seq.videoTracks[0].clips[0];\n\n// Read current values\nvar currentIn = trackItem.inPoint;   // Time object\nvar currentOut = trackItem.outPoint; // Time object\nvar currentStart = trackItem.start;  // Position in sequence\nvar currentEnd = trackItem.end;\n\n// Modify in/out points (Time objects, read/write)\ntrackItem.inPoint.seconds = 5.0;\ntrackItem.outPoint.seconds = 15.0;\n\n// Move clip position in timeline\ntrackItem.move(newStartTime); // Shifts by specified duration\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Setting Clip Colors/Labels Programmatically\n\n### Color Label Values (0-15)\n\n| Value | Color    | Value | Color   |\n|-------|----------|-------|---------|\n| 0     | Violet   | 8     | Cerulean|\n| 1     | Iris     | 9     | Lavender|\n| 2     | Caribbean| 10    | Forest  |\n| 3     | Cerulean | 11    | Rose    |\n| 4     | Forest   | 12    | Mango   |\n| 5     | Rose     | 13    | Purple  |\n| 6     | Mango    | 14    | Blue    |\n| 7     | Purple   | 15    | Yellow  |\n\n### Setting Color on ProjectItems\n\n```javascript\n// Get a project item\nvar projectItem = app.project.rootItem.children[0];\n\n// Set color label (0-15)\nprojectItem.setColorLabel(5);  // Rose\n\n// Get current color label\nvar currentColor = projectItem.getColorLabel();\n```\n\n### Important Limitation\n\n**TrackItems (clips on timeline) do not have a direct API for color labels.** You can only set colors on ProjectItems (clips in Project Panel).\n\n**Workaround:** Enable project-wide color syncing:\n1. File > Project Settings > General\n2. Enable \"Display the project item name and label color for all instances\"\n\nThis ensures color changes on ProjectItems propagate to all timeline instances.\n\n### Batch Color Assignment Example\n\n```javascript\nfunction colorClipsByType(bin, audioColor, videoColor) {\n    for (var i = 0; i < bin.children.numItems; i++) {\n        var item = bin.children[i];\n        \n        if (item.type === ProjectItemType.BIN) {\n            // Recursively process sub-bins\n            colorClipsByType(item, audioColor, videoColor);\n        } else if (item.type === ProjectItemType.CLIP) {\n            // Check if audio or video based on media path\n            var path = item.getMediaPath();\n            if (path && path.match(/\\.(wav|mp3|aiff|m4a)$/i)) {\n                item.setColorLabel(audioColor);\n            } else {\n                item.setColorLabel(videoColor);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Apply: audio = Cerulean (3), video = Forest (4)\ncolorClipsByType(app.project.rootItem, 3, 4);\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. Creating Markers and Annotations\n\n### Sequence Markers\n\n```javascript\nvar seq = app.project.activeSequence;\nvar markers = seq.markers;\n\n// Create marker at 5 seconds\nvar newMarker = markers.createMarker(5.0);\n\n// Set marker properties\nnewMarker.name = \"Scene Start\";\nnewMarker.comments = \"Begin transition here\";\n\n// Set marker type\nnewMarker.setTypeAsComment();    // Comment marker\nnewMarker.setTypeAsChapter();    // Chapter marker\nnewMarker.setTypeAsSegmentation(); // Segmentation marker\nnewMarker.setTypeAsWebLink();    // Web link marker\n\n// Set marker color (0-7)\n// 0=Green, 1=Red, 2=Purple, 3=Orange, 4=Yellow, 5=White, 6=Blue, 7=Cyan\nnewMarker.setColorByIndex(1, 0); // Red color\n\n// Create duration marker (range)\nvar rangeMarker = markers.createMarker(10.0);\nrangeMarker.end.seconds = 15.0; // 5-second duration marker\n```\n\n### Clip/ProjectItem Markers\n\n```javascript\nvar projectItem = app.project.rootItem.children[0];\nvar clipMarkers = projectItem.getMarkers();\n\n// Create marker on source clip\nvar sourceMarker = clipMarkers.createMarker(2.5);\nsourceMarker.name = \"Key Moment\";\nsourceMarker.comments = \"Use this shot\";\n```\n\n### Marker Navigation and Management\n\n```javascript\nvar markers = app.project.activeSequence.markers;\n\n// Get marker count\nvar count = markers.numMarkers;\n\n// Navigate markers\nvar firstMarker = markers.getFirstMarker();\nvar lastMarker = markers.getLastMarker();\nvar nextMarker = markers.getNextMarker(firstMarker);\nvar prevMarker = markers.getPrevMarker(lastMarker);\n\n// Delete a marker\nmarkers.deleteMarker(firstMarker);\n\n// Iterate through all markers\nvar current = markers.getFirstMarker();\nwhile (current) {\n    $.writeln(\"Marker: \" + current.name + \" at \" + current.start.seconds);\n    current = markers.getNextMarker(current);\n}\n```\n\n### Complete Marker Creation Example\n\n```javascript\nfunction createChapterMarkers(sequence, chapters) {\n    // chapters = [{time: 0, name: \"Intro\"}, {time: 30, name: \"Scene 1\"}, ...]\n    \n    for (var i = 0; i < chapters.length; i++) {\n        var chapter = chapters[i];\n        var marker = sequence.markers.createMarker(chapter.time);\n        \n        marker.name = chapter.name;\n        marker.setTypeAsChapter();\n        marker.setColorByIndex(4, 0); // Yellow\n        \n        if (chapter.comment) {\n            marker.comments = chapter.comment;\n        }\n    }\n}\n\n// Usage\ncreateChapterMarkers(app.project.activeSequence, [\n    {time: 0, name: \"Introduction\", comment: \"Opening titles\"},\n    {time: 45.5, name: \"Act 1\"},\n    {time: 120, name: \"Act 2\"},\n    {time: 180, name: \"Conclusion\"}\n]);\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Organizing Clips into Bins/Folders\n\n### Creating Bins\n\n```javascript\nvar rootBin = app.project.rootItem;\n\n// Create top-level bin\nvar footageBin = rootBin.createBin(\"Footage\");\n\n// Create nested bins\nvar bRollBin = footageBin.createBin(\"B-Roll\");\nvar interviewsBin = footageBin.createBin(\"Interviews\");\nvar graphicsBin = rootBin.createBin(\"Graphics\");\n\n// Create smart bin (auto-populates based on query)\nvar recentBin = rootBin.createSmartBin(\n    \"Recent Imports\",\n    \"dateModified:>=2024-01-01\"\n);\n```\n\n### Moving Items Between Bins\n\n```javascript\n// Get source item and destination bin\nvar sourceItem = app.project.rootItem.children[0];\nvar destinationBin = app.project.rootItem.children[1]; // Another bin\n\n// Move item to new bin\nsourceItem.moveBin(destinationBin);\n```\n\n### Finding and Organizing Items\n\n```javascript\n// Recursive function to find item by name\nfunction findItemByName(bin, name) {\n    for (var i = 0; i < bin.children.numItems; i++) {\n        var item = bin.children[i];\n        \n        if (item.name === name) {\n            return item;\n        }\n        \n        if (item.type === ProjectItemType.BIN) {\n            var found = findItemByName(item, name);\n            if (found) return found;\n        }\n    }\n    return null;\n}\n\n// Organize by file extension\nfunction organizeByType() {\n    var root = app.project.rootItem;\n    \n    // Create bins for different types\n    var videoBin = root.createBin(\"Video\");\n    var audioBin = root.createBin(\"Audio\");\n    var imageBin = root.createBin(\"Images\");\n    \n    // Iterate and organize\n    for (var i = root.children.numItems - 1; i >= 0; i--) {\n        var item = root.children[i];\n        if (item.type !== ProjectItemType.CLIP) continue;\n        \n        var path = item.getMediaPath();\n        if (!path) continue;\n        \n        if (path.match(/\\.(mov|mp4|avi|mxf)$/i)) {\n            item.moveBin(videoBin);\n        } else if (path.match(/\\.(wav|mp3|aiff|m4a)$/i)) {\n            item.moveBin(audioBin);\n        } else if (path.match(/\\.(jpg|png|tiff|psd)$/i)) {\n            item.moveBin(imageBin);\n        }\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Bin Management Operations\n\n```javascript\n// Rename bin\nvar myBin = app.project.rootItem.children[0];\nmyBin.renameBin(\"New Name\");\n\n// Delete bin (and all contents!)\nmyBin.deleteBin();\n\n// Check if item is a bin\nif (item.type === ProjectItemType.BIN) {\n    // It's a bin\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 6. Working with Sequences and Nested Sequences\n\n### Creating Sequences\n\n```javascript\n// Create sequence from preset\napp.project.createNewSequence(\"My Sequence\", \"presetPath\");\n\n// Create sequence from clips (uses clip settings)\nvar clips = [\n    app.project.rootItem.children[0],\n    app.project.rootItem.children[1]\n];\napp.project.createNewSequenceFromClips(\"Clip Sequence\", clips);\n```\n\n### Working with Active Sequence\n\n```javascript\nvar seq = app.project.activeSequence;\n\n// Sequence properties\nvar name = seq.name;\nvar duration = seq.end; // Time object in ticks\nvar frameRate = seq.timebase; // Ticks per frame\n\n// Get/Set player position\nvar currentPos = seq.getPlayerPosition();\nseq.setPlayerPosition(currentPos.seconds + 5); // Move 5 seconds forward\n\n// Set in/out points for playback/export\nseq.setInPoint(10);  // 10 seconds\nseq.setOutPoint(60); // 60 seconds\n\n// Get in/out points as Time objects\nvar inPoint = seq.getInPointAsTime();\nvar outPoint = seq.getOutPointAsTime();\n```\n\n### Creating Nested Sequences (Nesting)\n\nThe API does not have a direct \"nest\" function. Use `createSubsequence()` with this pattern:\n\n```javascript\nfunction nestSelection() {\n    var activeSequence = app.project.activeSequence;\n    var selection = activeSequence.getSelection();\n    \n    if (selection.length < 1) {\n        alert(\"Please select clips to nest\");\n        return null;\n    }\n    \n    // Get track of first selected item\n    var trackId = selection[0].parentTrackIndex;\n    \n    // Store original in/out points\n    var oldInPoint = activeSequence.getInPointAsTime();\n    var oldOutPoint = activeSequence.getOutPointAsTime();\n    \n    // Get selection boundaries\n    var start = selection[0].start;\n    var end = selection[selection.length - 1].end;\n    \n    // Set in/out to selection range\n    activeSequence.setInPoint(start.seconds);\n    activeSequence.setOutPoint(end.seconds);\n    \n    // Create subsequence (this becomes the nest)\n    var nestedSequence = activeSequence.createSubsequence(true);\n    \n    // Replace original clips with nested sequence\n    activeSequence.videoTracks[trackId].overwriteClip(\n        nestedSequence.projectItem,\n        start.seconds\n    );\n    \n    // Restore original in/out points\n    activeSequence.setInPoint(oldInPoint.seconds);\n    activeSequence.setOutPoint(oldOutPoint.seconds);\n    \n    return nestedSequence;\n}\n```\n\n### Working with Tracks\n\n```javascript\nvar seq = app.project.activeSequence;\n\n// Access tracks\nvar videoTrack = seq.videoTracks[0];\nvar audioTrack = seq.audioTracks[0];\n\n// Track count\nvar numVideoTracks = seq.videoTracks.numTracks;\nvar numAudioTracks = seq.audioTracks.numTracks;\n\n// Track properties and methods\nvideoTrack.setMute(true);  // Mute track\nvideoTrack.setMute(false); // Unmute\nvar isMuted = videoTrack.isMuted();\n\n// Access clips on track\nvar clips = videoTrack.clips; // TrackItemCollection\nfor (var i = 0; i < clips.numItems; i++) {\n    var clip = clips[i];\n    $.writeln(clip.name + \" starts at \" + clip.start.seconds);\n}\n```\n\n### Selection and Linking\n\n```javascript\nvar seq = app.project.activeSequence;\n\n// Get selected clips (sorted by time)\nvar selection = seq.getSelection();\n\n// Set clip selection state\nvar clip = seq.videoTracks[0].clips[0];\nclip.setSelected(true, true); // selected, updateUI\n\n// Link/unlink selected clips\nseq.linkSelection();\nseq.unlinkSelection();\n```\n\n---\n\n## Complete Working Example: Automated Edit Assembly\n\n```javascript\n// Automated edit assembly from organized bins\nfunction assembleEdit() {\n    var project = app.project;\n    var seq = project.activeSequence;\n    \n    // Find our organized bins\n    var interviewsBin = findBinByName(project.rootItem, \"Interviews\");\n    var bRollBin = findBinByName(project.rootItem, \"B-Roll\");\n    \n    if (!interviewsBin || !bRollBin) {\n        alert(\"Required bins not found!\");\n        return;\n    }\n    \n    var currentTime = 0;\n    \n    // Add interview clips to V1/A1\n    for (var i = 0; i < interviewsBin.children.numItems; i++) {\n        var clip = interviewsBin.children[i];\n        if (clip.type !== ProjectItemType.CLIP) continue;\n        \n        // Set color label\n        clip.setColorLabel(5); // Rose for interviews\n        \n        // Add to timeline\n        seq.videoTracks[0].overwriteClip(clip, currentTime);\n        \n        // Get clip duration and advance time\n        var trackItem = seq.videoTracks[0].clips[seq.videoTracks[0].clips.numItems - 1];\n        currentTime = trackItem.end.seconds;\n        \n        // Add marker at clip start\n        var marker = seq.markers.createMarker(trackItem.start.seconds);\n        marker.name = \"Interview: \" + clip.name;\n        marker.setTypeAsChapter();\n    }\n    \n    // Add B-roll to V2\n    var bRollTime = 5; // Start B-roll at 5 seconds\n    for (var j = 0; j < bRollBin.children.numItems; j++) {\n        var bRoll = bRollBin.children[j];\n        if (bRoll.type !== ProjectItemType.CLIP) continue;\n        \n        bRoll.setColorLabel(4);

no option to insert as individual clips\n4. **No undo grouping**: Scripts cannot group operations into single undo steps\n5. **Multi-cam limitations**: Multi-cam sequences cannot be inserted as nested sequences via API\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [Sequence Object Documentation](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/sequence/sequence/)\n- [ProjectItem Object Documentation](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/item/projectitem/)\n- [Adobe CEP Samples - PProPanel](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx)\n- [PremiereOnScript - Track and Clip Operations](https://premiereonscript.com/log-11/)\n- [Vakago Tools - Nesting Sequences](https://vakago-tools.com/how-to-nest-a-sequence-using-extendscript-in-premiere-pro/)\n- [Adobe Community - insertClip/overwriteClip Discussion](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/track-insertclip-track-overwriteclip-quirks-questions/td-p/10030777)\n- [Adobe Community - Accessing Bins](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/accessing-clips-inside-bins-using-extendscript/td-p/13761308)\n- [Adobe Community - Label Colors API](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/change-label-color-with-api-in-premiere/m-p/12585126)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1196,"cache_read_input_tokens":24858,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1196,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWAgq6yUYKR9faBD7kvqH","type":"assistant","uuid":"0eeac6ba-f5db-4344-8cdb-57b67ebfacd0","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:34:14.906Z"}
