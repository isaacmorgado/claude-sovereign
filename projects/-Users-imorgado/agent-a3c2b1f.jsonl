Whisper models were trained to predict approximate timestamps on speech segments (most of the time with 1-second accuracy), but they cannot originally predict word timestamps.(no content)Whisper is not explicitly trained for word-level timestamps and the current outputs are produced by an inference-time trick, which does not give perfectly accurate timing, especially when dealing with pauses.\n\n### How Word Timestamps Work\n\nThe word-level timestamp extraction system in Whisper provides precise timing information for individual words in transcribed audio. The system uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and cross-attention weights to align text tokens with audio frames, enabling applications like subtitle generation and precise audio-text synchronization.(no content)When `word_timestamps=True`, the pipeline extracts word-level timing information using cross-attention weights and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) alignment.\n\n### Third-Party Solutions for Better Word-Level Timestamps\n\n**WhisperX:**\nWhisperX offers accurate word-level timestamps using wav2vec2 alignment, along with multispeaker ASR using speaker diarization. While Whisper produces highly accurate transcriptions, the corresponding timestamps are at the utterance-level, not per word, and can be inaccurate by several seconds.\n\n**whisper-timestamped:**\nThis repository proposes an implementation to predict word timestamps and provide a more accurate estimation of speech segments when transcribing with Whisper models. Besides, a confidence score is assigned to each word and each segment. The approach is based on Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) applied to cross-attention weights.\n\n### Azure Integration\n\nMicrosoft Azure offers Whisper models with word-level timestamps support. Whisper models are available via the Azure OpenAI in Microsoft Foundry Models or via Azure Speech in Foundry Tools.\n\n### Key Limitations\n\nWhile Whisper does produce highly accurate transcriptions, the corresponding timestamps are at the utterance-level, not per word, and can be inaccurate by several seconds. OpenAI's whisper does not natively support batching.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"dfbd7b41-ac4c-4b57-892c-39ca78d6fca3","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:30:44.184Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"OpenAI Whisper API word-level timestamps transcription 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01F4G1RFh3cM1788xb9WsBA3","content":[{"title":"Whisper API & Word-Level Time-stamping - API - OpenAI Developer Community","url":"https://community.openai.com/t/whisper-api-word-level-time-stamping/123199"},{"title":"GitHub - linto-ai/whisper-timestamped: Multilingual Automatic Speech Recognition with word-level timestamps and confidence","url":"https://github.com/linto-ai/whisper-timestamped"},{"title":"How to obtain word-level segmentation timestamps? · openai/whisper · Discussion #1855","url":"https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/1855"},{"title":"Transcription Pipeline | openai/whisper | DeepWiki","url":"https://deepwiki.com/openai/whisper/4.1-transcription-pipeline"},{"title":"openai/whisper · Time stamp on word level & Speaker identification","url":"https://huggingface.co/spaces/openai/whisper/discussions/29"},{"title":"Word Timestamps | openai/whisper | DeepWiki","url":"https://deepwiki.com/openai/whisper/3.5-word-timestamps"},{"title":"The Whisper model from OpenAI - Foundry Tools | Microsoft Learn","url":"https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/speech-service/whisper-overview"},{"title":"How can I get word_timestamp? - API - OpenAI Developer Community","url":"https://community.openai.com/t/how-can-i-get-word-timestamp/333939"},{"title":"How to get Whisper's API to add timestamps to the transcripts? - API - OpenAI Developer Community","url":"https://community.openai.com/t/how-to-get-whispers-api-to-add-timestamps-to-the-transcripts/501788"},{"title":"GitHub - m-bain/whisperX: WhisperX: Automatic Speech Recognition with Word-level Timestamps (& Diarization)","url":"https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about OpenAI Whisper API word-level timestamps transcription:\n\n## OpenAI Whisper Word-Level Timestamps\n\n### Native Whisper Capabilities\n\nWhisper is a set of multi-lingual, robust speech recognition models trained by OpenAI that achieve state-of-the-art results in many languages.

However, accuracy varies dramatically based on audio quality, accents, domain-specific terminology, and real-world conditions.(no content)The best speech-to-text models achieve sub-5% Word Error Rates (WER) under optimal conditions. Canary Qwen 2.5B currently tops the Hugging Face Open ASR leaderboard with a 5.63% WER, while commercial solutions like GPT-4o-Transcribe and Deepgram Nova-3 also achieve <5% WER.\n\n### Top Performers in 2025\n\nFor raw transcriptions, AWS Transcribe and AssemblyAI tie for first place, with better accuracy than Deepgram and Whisper Streaming, as long as you can work with unformatted text and handle punctuation separately.(no content)Google's ASR was identified as the worst performer in one benchmark, coming last in every test category—including clean speech, noisy environments, accents, and technical speech.\n\n### Impact of Audio Quality\n\nOn clean, studio-quality audio, top AI engines can reach 95–98% accuracy. On real-world audio, accuracy often drops sharply, sometimes below 80%. Noise, accents, jargon, and overlapping speakers are the biggest accuracy killers.(no content)Clean recordings achieve 95-98% accuracy, native speakers perform 15-20% better than non-native speakers, each 10dB increase in noise reduces accuracy by 8-12%, and technical terminology can drop accuracy by 20-30%.\n\n### Accent Performance\n\nAI systems perform unevenly across accents because they are trained on uneven data.(no content)GPT-4o-Transcribe offers enhanced accuracy and language support over Whisper, with superior handling of accents and noisy environments.(no content)AssemblyAI claims consistent performance across accents and audio conditions.\n\n### Other Notable Solutions\n\nDeepgram's Nova-3 cuts word errors by more than half compared to competitors while maintaining pricing at $4.30 per 1,000 minutes. According to Deepgram's internal benchmarks, Nova-3 achieves up to a 36% lower WER than OpenAI Whisper on select datasets.(no content)Nova-3 supports 30+ languages and accents out of the box.\n\n### Best Practices for Benchmarking\n\nThe best benchmarking methodology utilizes holdout data sets not used for training, taken from real-life scenarios. These should encompass a wide range of audio lengths, diverse accents, varying environments, and subjects representative of production data.(no content)The generally accepted industry metric for measuring transcription quality is Word Error Rate (WER), which focuses on error rate rather than accuracy as the error rate can be subdivided into distinct error categories.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3bd22883-cbe3-4044-8d64-33c1cbe3aae4","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:31:21.333Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"transcription API accuracy comparison accents audio quality benchmark 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_011dBxgoSoJvySXDC2ZHgPJh","content":[{"title":"The Best Speech Recognition API in 2025: A Head-to-Head Comparison | Voice Writer Blog","url":"https://voicewriter.io/blog/best-speech-recognition-api-2025"},{"title":"How accurate is speech-to-text in 2025?","url":"https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-accurate-speech-to-text"},{"title":"Best Speech-to-Text APIs in 2025","url":"https://deepgram.com/learn/best-speech-to-text-apis"},{"title":"AI Transcription Accuracy 2025: Evaluating the New Gold Standard - Transcribetube","url":"https://www.transcribetube.com/blog/ai-transcription-accuracy"},{"title":"How Accurate Is AI Transcription in 2026?

OpenAI's Whisper API provides word-level timestamps but with some accuracy limitations; third-party wrappers like **WhisperX** or **whisper-timestamped** can improve this.\n\n---\n\n## 1. API Comparison Overview\n\n### OpenAI Whisper API\n\n**Pricing:** $6.00 per 1,000 minutes ($0.006/min)\n\n**Word-Level Timestamps:**\n- Available via `timestamp_granularities` parameter set to `[\"word\"]`\n- Uses Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and cross-attention weights for alignment\n- **Limitation:** Whisper was not explicitly trained for word-level timestamps. Current outputs are produced by an inference-time trick, which does not give perfectly accurate timing, especially when dealing with pauses.\n- Timestamps can be inaccurate by several seconds at the utterance level\n\n**Speaker Diarization:** Not natively supported\n\n**Better Alternatives for Word Timestamps:**\n- [WhisperX](https://github.com/m-bain/whisperX) - Uses wav2vec2 alignment for accurate word-level timestamps plus speaker diarization\n- [whisper-timestamped](https://github.com/linto-ai/whisper-timestamped) - Improved word timestamp estimation with confidence scores\n\n---\n\n### AssemblyAI\n\n**Pricing (2025):**\n| Feature | Cost |\n|---------|------|\n| Universal (Pre-recorded) | $0.0025/min ($0.15/hr) |\n| Slam-1 (Higher accuracy) | $0.0045/min ($0.27/hr) |\n| Universal-Streaming | $0.0025/min ($0.15/hr) |\n| Speaker Identification | +$0.00033/min |\n| Sentiment Analysis | +$0.00033/min |\n| Summarization | +$0.0005/min |\n\n**Free Tier:** $50 in credits (~185 hours pre-recorded, ~333 hours streaming)\n\n**Word-Level Timestamps:**\n- Built-in with every transcription\n- Returns array with `start` and `end` timings for each word\n- Streaming API provides `word_is_final` flag and detailed timing\n\n**Speaker Diarization:**\n- Native support with speaker labels\n- Works across multiple speakers with consistent labeling\n\n**Accuracy:** Ties for first place with AWS Transcribe in benchmarks for raw transcription accuracy\n\n**Output Formats:** TXT, SRT, VTT, JSON\n\n---\n\n### Deepgram Nova-3\n\n**Pricing (2025):**\n| Processing Type | Cost per Minute | Cost per 1,000 Minutes |\n|-----------------|-----------------|------------------------|\n| Batch/Pre-recorded | $0.0043/min | $4.30 |\n| Real-time Streaming | $0.0077/min | $7.70 |\n| Volume Discount | - | $3.60/1,000 min |\n\n**Free Credits:** $200 (approx. 46,512 minutes batch / 25,974 minutes streaming)\n\n**Word-Level Timestamps:**\n- Built-in with diarization at no extra cost\n- Precise timing for subtitle generation and video editing\n\n**Speaker Diarization:**\n- Included in base price\n- Automatic speaker detection and labeling\n\n**Accuracy Claims:**\n- 50%+ lower Word Error Rate (WER) vs competitors\n- 36% lower WER than OpenAI Whisper on select datasets\n- Sub-300ms latency for real-time transcription\n- Strong performance on noisy, accented, or overlapping speech\n\n**Notable Features:**\n- Smart formatting (punctuation, capitalization, paragraphing)\n- Numeral conversion\n- Filler word detection (\"uh\", \"um\")\n- Vocabulary prompting for specialized terms\n- 30+ languages and accents\n\n---\n\n### Rev.ai\n\n**Pricing:** Not publicly listed in detail; requires contacting sales\n\n**Word-Level Timestamps:**\n- Every word includes `ts` (start time) and `end_ts` (end time) fields\n- Option for improved per-word timestamp accuracy (disabled by default)\n\n**Speaker Diarization:**\n- Performed by default on all async API transcriptions\n- Supports up to 8 speakers (English) / 6 speakers (non-English)\n- Generic labels: \"Speaker 1\", \"Speaker 2\", etc.\n- Standard and Premium diarization options\n\n**Unique Features:**\n- Trained on 3 million+ hours of human-transcribed audio\n- 36 language support\n- Verbatim vs non-verbatim output control\n- Open-source models available ([Reverb ASR](https://www.rev.com/blog/introducing-reverb-open-source-asr-diarization))\n\n---\n\n### Gladia\n\n**Pricing:**\n- Free tier: 10 hours/month\n- Pay-as-you-go and subscription options available\n- Enterprise pricing upon request\n\n**Word-Level Timestamps:**\n- Built-in with all transcriptions\n- Sub-600ms latency for live transcription\n- ~300ms for immediate response processing\n\n**Speaker Diarization:** Included in free tier\n\n**Notable Use Case:** Powers VEED (leading AI video editor platform) for subtitle generation\n\n---\n\n## 2.
