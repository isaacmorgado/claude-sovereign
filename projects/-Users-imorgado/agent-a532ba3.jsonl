For pcm_s16le_16, the input audio must be 16-bit PCM at a 16kHz sample rate, single channel (mono), and little-endian byte order. Using this format results in lower latency compared to passing an encoded waveform.\n\n## Pricing Structure\n\nElevenLabs offers multiple tiers: Free, Starter, Creator, Pro, Scale, and Business. The Voice Isolator API is among the available models alongside Text to Speech, Speech to Text, Voice Changer, Sound Effects, and Music APIs.(no content)Usage-based billing offers a fixed price for each additional 1,000 credits used over your limit. For V1 English, V1 Multilingual and V2 Multilingual models, one text character costs 1 credit.(no content)On the Creator plan, you get 100,000 characters of TTS output using the Multilingual model, with overages billed at $0.30 per 1,000 characters. On the Pro plan, the cost drops to $0.24 per 1,000. Scale brings it further down to $0.18, and Business cuts it to $0.12 per 1,000 characters.\n\n## Rate Limits / Concurrency\n\nThe concurrency limit (concurrent requests running in parallel) depends on the tier you are on.(no content)The Free tier has a concurrency limit of 2, with audio quality of 128 kbps at 44.1kHz.(no content)Overages are billed at per-character or per-minute rates. API rate limits are enforced per account and plan.(no content)Concurrency limits range from 4–30 concurrent sessions depending on the plan.\n\n## Documentation & Getting Started\n\nYou can get started by signing up for a free account.

Adobe Podcast Enhance, also called Enhance Speech, is a feature within the Adobe Podcast suite.\n\n**How it works:**\nOnce you upload your audio file to the Enhance Speech feature, the AI isolates the primary voice track. It filters out background noise, echoes, and other unwanted sounds, ensuring the speaker's voice takes center stage.\n\n**Features:**\nThe voice isolator feature uses AI to separate the speaker's voice from background noise by identifying and isolating vocal frequencies. This is great for podcasts with multiple speakers or when there's unwanted noise in the background, like street traffic or echoes.\n\n**Free tier limitations:**\nAdobe Podcast's Enhance Speech is a free online tool that allows you to upload 30-minute files (files must also be less than 500MB) and process one hour of audio recording time per day. The free version is limited to audio-only source files and doesn't give control over how much processing is applied.\n\n**Key limitation:**\nAdobe Podcast Enhance, known as Adobe Enhance Speech, and similar services from other players, such as Dolby, face the same limitation. They don't offer real-time streaming voice isolation.\n\n### Dolby.io\n\nDolby.io is the cloud-based audio, voice, and video API platform used to transform media and communication apps. It incorporates lifelike HD audio and video into applications to provide a premium user experience.\n\n**Features:**\nThe platform offers media transformation capabilities for audio/video editing with features including noise suppression, high-quality video, security, automating podcasting inspection, and professional-sounding interview noise cancellation.\n\n**User feedback:**\nUsers praise the quality communication whether it's podcasting or streaming, particularly the audio quality. However, some note they \"lack in their exaggerated pricing structure and customer support.\"\n\n### Key Differences & Recommendations\n\nFor media editing like podcasts, ElevenLabs, Adobe, or Dolby are recommended for post-processing. However, end-user tools and cloud APIs may deliver great results in specific scenarios, but they can't provide the guaranteed, consistent performance production applications require.\n\n**For real-time applications:**\nVoice isolators that separate human speech from background noise in real time require developer SDKs like Koala Noise Suppression, which offer cross-platform support with low latency and self-service integration.\n\n### Alternative Tools Worth Considering (2024-2025)\n\nAccording to recent testing, ElevenLabs Voice Isolator delivered the best-sounding results from challenging test clips and was very easy to use. Altered Studio's AI Voice Cleaner came a close second in terms of providing clean audio, but the online app is less intuitive.(no content)Testing methodology for 2025 comparisons included 200+ noise profiles (construction, wind, crowds), with tools ranked on isolation accuracy, speed, usability, and price-to-value ratio, supported by Audio Engineering Society guidelines.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"d90d6f10-c917-49e3-bb76-988e7ac55393","timestamp":"2025-12-16T16:30:50.087Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"voice isolation API comparison Adobe Podcast Dolby.io 2024 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_019u3aU1KcjXSGzSwMAnvqeN","content":[{"title":"Top 7 AI Voice Isolation Tools Tested by Audio Engineers (2025)","url":"https://www.voiceisolator.org/posts/top-7-ai-voice-isolation-tools"},{"title":"Top Audio Enhancement Models in 2024","url":"https://www.sievedata.com/resources/top-audio-enhance-models-2024"},{"title":"Voice Isolator Guide 2025: Real-Time Audio Enhancement for Developers","url":"https://picovoice.ai/blog/voice-isolator/"},{"title":"Adobe Podcast AI Tools Review 2025 - The Podcast Consultant","url":"https://thepodcastconsultant.com/blog/adobe-podcast-ai-tools-everything-you-need-to-know"},{"title":"A Closer Look at Adobe Audition 2025's Capabilities","url":"https://www.podcastvideos.com/articles/a-closer-look-at-adobe-audition-2025s-capabilities/"},{"title":"The Top AI Audio Cleanup Tools In 2024 - MASV","url":"https://massive.io/gear-guides/the-top-ai-audio-cleanup-tools/"},{"title":"Wanna hear an AI voice isolation comparison? by Scott Simmons - ProVideo Coalition","url":"https://www.provideocoalition.com/wanna-hear-an-ai-voice-isolation-comparison/"},{"title":"Voice Isolator vs. Adobe Podcast: Which Saves More Time in 2025?","url":"https://www.voiceisolator.org/posts/which-saves-more-time-in-2025"},{"title":"Dolby.io Pricing, Alternatives & More 2025 | Capterra","url":"https://www.capterra.com/p/214213/Dolby-io/"},{"title":"Adobe Podcast Enhance: AI Tools for High-Quality Podcast Audio","url":"https://murf.ai/blog/adobe-podcast-enhance"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a comparison of voice isolation APIs from Adobe Podcast and Dolby.io in 2024-2025:\n\n## Voice Isolation API Comparison: Adobe Podcast vs Dolby.io (2024-2025)\n\n### Adobe Podcast Enhance Speech\n\nAdobe Podcast serves as a comprehensive audio recording and editing tool that operates directly within a web browser.

It takes files up to 500MB and 1 hour in length.\n\n### LALAL.AI\nLALAL.AI offers batch upload capability to process multiple files at once for efficient editing.(no content)You can activate your package on multiple devices/browsers, in the LALAL.AI desktop app, and use their API.(no content)In LALAL.AI Stem Splitter, you can use Enhanced Processing and De-Echo features to significantly refine audio quality by reducing various unwanted artifacts.

Higher values mean more RAM usage but slightly faster processing (default: 1). Window size balances quality and speed: 1024 = fast but lower quality, 320 = slower but better quality.\n\n## Best Practices\n\n### Real-Time vs. Batch Processing\nFor real-time voice isolation, on-device solutions are the only options, as cloud voice isolation APIs introduce network delays, hence, are not a fit for real-time processing.(no content)ElevenLabs Voice Isolator is a cloud API for recorded audio cleaning. However, their documentation explicitly states it doesn't support real-time streaming. You upload an audio file, wait for processing, and download the processed file.\n\n### SDK Integration\nModern SDKs provide straightforward integration with consistent APIs across platforms. Implementation typically takes minutes rather than weeks, with immediate self-service access for testing and production deployment.\n\n### Quality Considerations\nBenchmark tests show modern voice isolation can achieve 4-5x improvement in speech intelligibility compared to older solutions.(no content)For Demucs architecture, the number of predictions with random shifts affects quality: higher = slower but better quality. Overlap between prediction windows (0.001-0.999) also follows this pattern: higher = slower but better quality.\n\n### Platform Recommendations\nFor real-time applications requiring developer control, Koala offers practical voice isolation with self-service access and cross-platform support.

Wistia is one of the first Adobe Podcast's official business-to-business SaaS partners to offer this powerful capability to its customers.\n\n### Key Features of the API\n\nAdobe Podcast's Enhance Speech creates studio-grade audio even from low-quality sources like a laptop microphone. Its cutting-edge AI and machine learning algorithms automatically filter out background noise and adjust tone and volume levels.\n\n### Integration Capabilities\n\nThe Wistia integration demonstrates what the API can enable:\n- Seamlessly improve audio clarity — By refining the sound characteristics of speech and reducing background noise, users can produce professional-quality videos more easily.\n- Simplify the audio editing process with minimal effort — With the click of a button, users can effortlessly make their audio sound like it was recorded in a professional studio.\n- Ensure non-destructive editing and previewing of the enhanced audio — Wistia's video editor allows users to enhance the audio of an entire project or an individual clip.\n\n### Availability\n\nEnhance Speech, powered by Adobe Podcast, is now available in beta for all paid Wistia Customers.\n\n### Enhance Speech v2 Release\n\nIn November 2024, the company released version two of Enhance Speech within Adobe Podcast, its online suite of podcasting tools.(no content)Adobe introduced Enhance Speech v2 with improvements to transform audio and video recordings into studio-quality sound.\n\nKey v2 features include:\n- Natural clarity: Clear, natural dialogue without robotic tones—no matter the language or recording conditions. It handles everything from noisy crowds to poor acoustics and delivers studio-quality audio.\n- Strength slider: Powered by their Sound Lift AI model, the updated slider allows you to balance speech clarity with ambient noise. Want a bit of café ambiance in your podcast?

Wistia is one of the first Adobe Podcast's official business-to-business SaaS partners to offer this powerful capability to its customers.\n\n### Key Features of the API\n\nAdobe Podcast's Enhance Speech creates studio-grade audio even from low-quality sources like a laptop microphone. Its cutting-edge AI and machine learning algorithms automatically filter out background noise and adjust tone and volume levels.\n\n### Integration Capabilities\n\nThe Wistia integration demonstrates what the API can enable:\n- Seamlessly improve audio clarity — By refining the sound characteristics of speech and reducing background noise, users can produce professional-quality videos more easily.\n- Simplify the audio editing process with minimal effort — With the click of a button, users can effortlessly make their audio sound like it was recorded in a professional studio.\n- Ensure non-destructive editing and previewing of the enhanced audio — Wistia's video editor allows users to enhance the audio of an entire project or an individual clip.\n\n### Availability\n\nEnhance Speech, powered by Adobe Podcast, is now available in beta for all paid Wistia Customers.\n\n### Enhance Speech v2 Release\n\nIn November 2024, the company released version two of Enhance Speech within Adobe Podcast, its online suite of podcasting tools.(no content)Adobe introduced Enhance Speech v2 with improvements to transform audio and video recordings into studio-quality sound.\n\nKey v2 features include:\n- Natural clarity: Clear, natural dialogue without robotic tones—no matter the language or recording conditions. It handles everything from noisy crowds to poor acoustics and delivers studio-quality audio.\n- Strength slider: Powered by their Sound Lift AI model, the updated slider allows you to balance speech clarity with ambient noise. Want a bit of café ambiance in your podcast? Adjust the slider to find the perfect mix.\n- Noise removal: Background noise, reverb, and music—v2 removes it all, keeping your message sharp and clear.\n\n### Limitations for External Developers\n\nIt's worth noting that Adobe Podcast does not offer a standalone API for external integration. This means you can only use the tool within Adobe's platform. This limits flexibility for those who want to automate audio enhancement through external systems or integrate it into custom workflows.\n\nThe B2B SaaS partnership model (like with Wistia) appears to be Adobe's approach for extending the Enhance Speech capability to third-party platforms, rather than offering a public developer API."],"durationSeconds":26.95398216699995}}

For x-api-key authentication, you pass only the API key in the x-api-key header.\n\n### Method 1: OAuth Bearer Token Authentication\n\nCall `https://api.dolby.com/media/oauth2/token` to get an access token. The token generation endpoint requires the API secret encoded to Base64 in an Authorization header as the Basic type.(no content)The endpoint returns an access token in the JSON Web Token (JWT) format.

After exporting the keys, the next step is to obtain your JSON Web token (JWT) using: `curl -X POST 'https://api.dolby.com/media/oauth2/token' --header 'Authorization: Basic $BASE64_KEY_SECRET' --header 'Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded' --data 'grant_type=client_credentials'`\n\n### Method 2: API Key Authentication\n\nFor this method of authentication, you will pass your credentials as the x-api-key header with every request. This is the simplest approach to authentication and can work well for testing or code that runs in a protected environment.\n\n### Example API Call Format\n\nThe authorization header format looks like: `headers = { \"Authorization\": \"Bearer {0}\".format(api_token), \"Content-Type\": \"application/json\", \"Accept\": \"application/json\" }`\n\n### Important Security Notes\n\nAPI tokens are essential to ensure the security and privacy of data exchanged through the API.
