For mutations as well, the status has been changed from `loading` to `pending`. A new derived `isLoading` flag has been added that is implemented as `isPending && isFetching`.(no content)This means `isLoading` and `isInitialLoading` have the same thing, but `isInitialLoading` is deprecated and will be removed in the next major version.\n\n### Suspense Support (Now Stable)\n\nSuspense for data fetching is no longer experimental but fully supported. React Query ships with new `useSuspenseQuery`, `useSuspenseInfiniteQuery`, and `useSuspenseQueries` hooks.(no content)V5 also comes with an experimental integration for suspense on the server in Next.js. The react-query-next-experimental adapter allows you to write a single `useSuspenseQuery` which will initiate data fetching as early as possible on the server during SSR, then stream the result to the client.\n\n### API Simplifications\n\nThe biggest breaking change in v5 is the removal of overloads. The API is now much more consistent - you always just pass one object.(no content)V5 renamed `cacheTime` to `gcTime` to better reflect what it's doing, merged `keepPreviousData` with `placeholderData`, renamed loading states to pending, and removed the callbacks from `useQuery`.\n\n### Server-Side Retry Defaults\n\nOn the server, retry now defaults to 0 instead of 3. For prefetching, the default was always 0 retries, but since queries with suspense enabled can now execute directly on the server as well, they need to ensure no retries happen on the server.\n\n### Infinite Queries Enhancement\n\nV5 includes a new `maxPages` option for infinite queries to limit the number of pages to store in the query data and to refetch.\n\n### Migration Tools\n\nTo make migration easier, v5 comes with a codemod. The codemod is a best-efforts attempt to help you migrate the breaking changes. Please review the generated code thoroughly!\n\n### General Best Practices\n\nTanStack is a powerful collection of headless utilities for building modern web applications. It includes all the essential features for modern state management: smart caching, background refetching, optimistic updates, and smooth error handling.(no content)While queries handle data fetching, mutations manage data changes like creating, updating, or deleting records. TanStack Query's mutation system gives you powerful features including optimistic updates, automatic retry logic, and smooth error handling.(no content)If you're building a React app in 2025, TanStack should be in your stack.

For mobile users on shaky connections, that difference is significant.(no content)For a simple todo app, bundle sizes are: Svelte (9.7KB), Vue (34KB), React (42.2KB).(no content)React uses a virtual DOM to manage updates, which adds overhead, especially for complex applications. React's bundle size, when compressed, is around 42.2 kB, significantly larger than Svelte's 1.6 kB.\n\n### Performance Characteristics\n\n**Svelte:**\nSvelte takes a radically different approach by shifting much of the work to compile time. Instead of relying on a virtual DOM, Svelte compiles components into highly efficient JavaScript at build time, resulting in minimal runtime overhead. This means faster updates to the DOM and smaller bundle sizes.(no content)Svelte has no Virtual DOM, smallest bundles, and fastest performance. Svelte apps typically load in about 40% less time than similar React builds.(no content)Thanks to its ahead-of-time compilation, Svelte apps generally have the smallest possible bundles, reducing network transfer and parsing costs. Svelte surgically updates the DOM, avoiding the virtual DOM reconciliation overhead. With fewer abstractions and indirection, Svelte apps tend to be lighter on memory usage.\n\n**React:**\nReact brings ecosystem heft, concurrent UI innovation, and scalability, with slightly bigger performance costs.(no content)React excels in massive SPAs with complex state and frequent updates, especially where its architecture and community-proven patterns shine.\n\n**Vue:**\nVue is very efficient performance-wise. However, because it still uses a virtual DOM, it has some runtime overhead (unlike Svelte's compiled approach). Vue apps also often have smaller bundles than comparable React apps, giving them a speed edge on load time.(no content)Vue's smart reactivity and approachable design make it nimble, especially with advanced SSR.\n\n## Best Use Cases in 2025\n\nReact is usually the safest option for hiring and ecosystem, Vue is often the easiest frontend framework for small teams, and Svelte is a strong pick when performance and lean bundles outrank everything else.\n\n| Framework | Best For |\n|-----------|----------|\n| **Svelte** | Smaller applications, static sites, and widgets where initial render and bundle size are top priorities |\n| **React** | Massive SPAs with complex state and frequent updates |\n| **Vue** | A balanced solution, scaling well and suiting both small projects and sizable enterprise-grade systems |\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nAll three frameworks are suitable for high-performance apps in 2025; careful coding and best practices matter just as much as your choice of technology.(no content)If your primary goal is to deliver the fastest user experience in 2025, performance comparisons put Svelte in the leading position.(no content)React remains the king of the job market.

Svelte is the exciting, high-performance rebel that's reshaping what web frameworks can be."],"durationSeconds":28.061108374999954}}

Chakra UI emerged as the developer-friendly alternative with its simple API and excellent TypeScript support. Now, shadcn/ui has disrupted the entire category with a radically different approach: copy-paste components instead of npm packages.\n\n### Key Differences\n\n**shadcn/ui**\n- Not a component library in the traditional sense. You don't install it as a dependency from npm. Instead, it's a curated collection of beautifully designed, reusable components that you copy and paste directly into your project via a CLI command. These components are built using Radix UI for accessibility and behavior, and styled with Tailwind CSS.\n- Once a component is in your codebase, it's yours. You have 100% control over its code, styling, and behavior.\n- Excellent accessibility through Radix UI primitives with WAI-ARIA standards at their core. Zero runtime overhead because it's just Tailwind CSS with no runtime CSS-in-JS library.\n- Compatible with React 19 and Tailwind v4.\n\n**Material UI (MUI)**\n- A cornerstone of the React ecosystem for years, providing a comprehensive suite of components that let developers build functional user interfaces with remarkable speed. Its adherence to Google's Material Design principles offers a consistent, predictable, and robust foundation.\n- The downside is that it can sometimes feel restrictive. The components are designed to follow Material Design principles closely, which can limit creativity if you want to deviate from that design language.\n- Provides robust RTL support and built-in locale providers for dozens of languages.\n\n**Chakra UI**\n- Designed for fast, accessible, and consistent React development. Its components are well-structured, responsive, and easy to theme. Requires Node 20+, and works great with Next.js.\n- Emphasizes simplicity and accessibility, providing a set of modular, composable components that are easy to use and customize.\n- Has built-in roles and focus styles for every component.\n\n### When to Choose Each\n\n**shadcn/ui**: For maximum control and a bespoke design system you own. **Chakra UI**: For the best-in-class developer experience and rapid, accessible development.(no content)**MUI**: For building internal tools or admin dashboards where speed of initial development trumps design uniqueness, or when your team is already proficient with it.(no content)Choose Material-UI for enterprise projects where comprehensive component libraries, advanced features, and team scalability outweigh bundle size concerns.\n\n### Performance Considerations\n\nIf every KB matters, shadcn/ui wins. If developer speed trumps bundle size, Chakra UI excels.(no content)Lightweight Tailwind-based styling (used by shadcn/ui) outperforms Emotion/Styled Components used by MUI and Chakra.\n\n### Trade-offs\n\nFor shadcn/ui: You are responsible for updates; if a bug is fixed upstream, you may need to re-copy the component. If you or your team are not fans of utility-first CSS, this is a non-starter.(no content)shadcn/ui requires familiarity with Tailwind CSS and React, and has a smaller community. MUI's extensive documentation and forums offer quicker troubleshooting.\n\n### 2025 Recommendation\n\nFor most React projects in 2025, starting with Chakra UI is recommended for its excellent balance of developer experience, performance, and flexibility. It provides the fastest path to a polished UI while maintaining reasonable bundle sizes. Upgrade to shadcn/ui when performance becomes critical or when you need extensive customization.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0f69326a-a2d2-4bc1-a966-8f93e42e11e0","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:00:30.790Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"shadcn/ui vs Material UI vs Chakra UI comparison 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01XXMuF8imHAJYr29BVPAzFr","content":[{"title":"Shadcn/ui vs Chakra UI vs Material-UI: Component Battle 2025","url":"https://asepalazhari.com/blog/shadcn-ui-vs-chakra-ui-vs-material-ui-component-battle-2025"},{"title":"UI Libraries Compared: Shadcn/ui, Tailwind, Ant Design, Chakra, Material UI - Fyonda.io - Welcome to our website","url":"https://fyonda.io/blog/ui-libraries-2025/"},{"title":"Why I Choose shadcn/ui Over Other UI Libraries in 2025 | by Syeda Zainab | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@szainabshah806/why-i-choose-shadcn-ui-over-other-ui-libraries-in-2025-b64e3243d92c"},{"title":"Ditching MUI in 2025? 3 Ultimate Alternatives to Use | JunKangWorld","url":"https://junkangworld.com/blog/ditching-mui-in-2025-3-ultimate-alternatives-to-use"},{"title":"Why I Chose Shadcn Over MUI/Chakra for My SaaS UI | by Joseph Goins | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@joseph.goins/why-i-chose-shadcn-over-mui-chakra-for-my-saas-ui-ad3b1eeaa727"},{"title":"React UI libraries in 2025: Comparing shadcn/ui, Radix, Mantine, MUI, Chakra & more - Makers' Den — Makers Den","url":"https://makersden.io/blog/react-ui-libs-2025-comparing-shadcn-radix-mantine-mui-chakra"},{"title":"ShadCN-UI vs. Other UI Libraries(Material-UI,Ant Design, ...","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/shadcn-ui-vs-other-ui-librariesmaterial-uiant-design-css-yanguema-q7ptc"},{"title":"ShadCN-UI vs. Other UI Libraries: The Ultimate Showdown for Your Next Project","url":"https://apidog.com/blog/shadcn-ui-vs-other-ui-libraries/"},{"title":"Shadcn UI vs. Traditional Frameworks: Why Modern Developers Are Making the Switch | by Mr Senior | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@abdooy640/shadcn-ui-vs-traditional-frameworks-why-modern-developers-are-making-the-switch-2bea885a6269"},{"title":"Top 9 Shadcn UI Alternatives You Should Know (2024)","url":"https://snappify.com/blog/shadcn-ui-alternatives"}]},"Here's a comprehensive comparison of shadcn/ui, Material UI (MUI), and Chakra UI based on 2025 insights:\n\n## shadcn/ui vs Material UI vs Chakra UI Comparison (2025)\n\n### Overview\n\nMaterial-UI (now MUI) has dominated the enterprise space with its comprehensive design system.

If you're integrating with Adobe software or would like a complete component library to use in your project, look no further!(no content)React Spectrum components are designed with accessibility top-of-mind and include full screen reader and keyboard navigation support. React Spectrum components are designed to work with mouse, touch, and keyboard interactions.\n\n### React Aria\nReact Aria is a collection of unstyled React components and hooks that helps you build accessible, high quality UI components for your own application or design system. If you're building a component library for the web from scratch with your own styling, start here.\n\n### Spectrum CSS\nSpectrum CSS is the standard CSS implementation of the Spectrum design language.(no content)Spectrum CSS should only be used by implementations of Spectrum, or very simple applications that only need things like typography, checkboxes, text fields, etc. Adobe maintains separate libraries written with web components and React that work in partnership with Spectrum CSS to create fully interactive Spectrum components.(no content)All components in this library have a peer dependency on @spectrum-css/tokens, which is a local package that serves up the Spectrum design tokens as CSS custom properties. These custom properties are leveraged in all components to create a cohesive visual language and to allow for easy theming.\n\n## 2025 Updates\n\n### January 2025 Release\nThe first release of 2025 includes a new firstDayOfWeek prop for calendar and date picker components, support for CSS transitions in overlay components, a new Autocomplete component in alpha, and a new React Aria test utils package.(no content)The new Autocomplete component is now available in alpha! Similar to a ComboBox, this component provides the ability to display a list of suggestions as the user types in a text input. However, it is more flexible, supporting use cases such as command palettes and searchable menus.\n\n### October 2025 Release\nThis release brings some long-awaited features, including multi-selection in React Aria Select and enhanced animation support across components. For example, Disclosure now provides CSS variables to easily animate expanding and collapsing.\n\n## Visual Languages (Spectrum CSS)\n.spectrum is the default visual language representing the Spectrum 2 foundations. .spectrum--legacy is the legacy Spectrum 1 visual language, which will be deprecated in Spectrum 2.\n\n## Recommendations for React Development\nAdobe recommends using swc-react over React Spectrum in add-ons based on React, because it currently offers a more comprehensive set of components which provide built-in benefits, and is more actively supported.(no content)Spectrum Web Components are native web components that work with vanilla JavaScript, while swc-react provides React wrapper components for the same Spectrum Web Components. Use Spectrum Web Components for basic JavaScript projects and swc-react for React-based add-ons.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b01d664d-aad3-4a33-a821-adb1b94eb71e","timestamp":"2025-12-17T03:01:06.130Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe Spectrum design system CSS React components 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Gu8t9YF9voESxgUYwAJuvq","content":[{"title":"Implementation Guide","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons/docs/guides/build/design/implementation_guide/"},{"title":"Adobe Design System Spectrum – UI Guidelines, Components","url":"https://designsystems.surf/design-systems/adobe"},{"title":"GitHub - adobe/spectrum-css: The standard CSS implementation of the Spectrum design language.","url":"https://github.com/adobe/spectrum-css"},{"title":"A React implementation of Spectrum, Adobe's design system","url":"https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html"},{"title":"Building UIs using Adobe's Spectrum Design System","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/express/add-ons/docs/guides/tutorials/spectrum-workshop/"},{"title":"React Spectrum Libraries","url":"https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/"},{"title":"October 2, 2025 Release - React Spectrum - Adobe","url":"https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/releases/2025-10-02.html"},{"title":"GitHub - adobe/react-spectrum: A collection of libraries and tools that help you build adaptive, accessible, and robust user experiences.","url":"https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum"},{"title":"Releases - React Spectrum - Adobe","url":"https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/releases/index.html"},{"title":"January 15, 2025 Release - React Spectrum Libraries - Adobe","url":"https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/releases/2025-01-15.html"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about Adobe Spectrum design system CSS and React components in 2025:\n\n## Overview\n\nReact Spectrum is a project that implements Adobe's Spectrum design language into React UI components.(no content)Spectrum offers open-source implementations such as Spectrum CSS, React Spectrum, and Spectrum Web Components, along with detailed usage guidelines.\n\n## Key Libraries\n\n### React Spectrum\nReact Spectrum is an implementation of Adobe's design system.

For example, Disclosure now provides CSS variables to easily animate expanding and collapsing.\n\n## Visual Languages (Spectrum CSS)\n.spectrum is the default visual language representing the Spectrum 2 foundations. .spectrum--legacy is the legacy Spectrum 1 visual language, which will be deprecated in Spectrum 2.\n\n## Recommendations for React Development\nAdobe recommends using swc-react over React Spectrum in add-ons based on React, because it currently offers a more comprehensive set of components which provide built-in benefits, and is more actively supported.(no content)Spectrum Web Components are native web components that work with vanilla JavaScript, while swc-react provides React wrapper components for the same Spectrum Web Components. Use Spectrum Web Components for basic JavaScript projects and swc-react for React-based add-ons."],"durationSeconds":27.275199750000027}}

Web App Frontend\n\n### Framework Selection: React + Next.js\n\n**Recommendation: Next.js 15 with React 19**\n\n| Framework | Bundle Size | Performance | Ecosystem | Recommendation |\n|-----------|-------------|-------------|-----------|----------------|\n| React/Next.js | ~40KB | Good (Virtual DOM) | Largest | **Best for this use case** |\n| Vue/Nuxt | ~20KB | Good | Strong | Good alternative |\n| Svelte/SvelteKit | ~1.6KB | Best | Growing | Consider for CEP panel |\n\n**Rationale:**\n- Largest ecosystem for audio/media components\n- Best library support for waveform visualization (wavesurfer.js)\n- TanStack Query has first-class React support\n- Easier to hire developers\n- Server Components for optimal performance\n\n### Component Library: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui\n\n**Recommendation: shadcn/ui (80+ components)**\n\n```bash\nnpx shadcn@latest init\n```\n\n**Why shadcn/ui over alternatives:**\n\n| Library | Bundle Impact | Customization | Accessibility |\n|---------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| **shadcn/ui** | Zero runtime (Tailwind only) | Full ownership of code | Built on Radix UI |\n| Material UI | ~90KB+ | Theme overrides | Good |\n| Chakra UI | ~50KB+ | Style props | Excellent |\n\nKey benefits:\n- Copy-paste model gives full control over component code\n- Built on Radix UI primitives for accessibility\n- Compatible with React 19 and Tailwind v4\n- No runtime CSS-in-JS overhead\n- Dark mode support built-in\n\n### State Management Architecture\n\n```\n┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n│                   State Architecture                     │\n├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n│  Server State (Async)    │  Client State (Sync)         │\n│

│\n└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n```\n\n**TanStack Query v5 Configuration:**\n\n```typescript\n// lib/query-client.ts\nimport { QueryClient } from '@tanstack/react-query';\n\nexport const queryClient = new QueryClient({\n  defaultOptions: {\n    queries: {\n      staleTime: 1000 * 60 * 5, // 5 minutes\n      gcTime: 1000 * 60 * 30,   // 30 minutes (renamed from cacheTime in v5)\n      retry: 3,\n      refetchOnWindowFocus: false,\n    },\n    mutations: {\n      retry: 0,\n    },\n  },\n});\n```\n\nKey v5 changes to note:\n- `loading` status renamed to `pending`\n- `isLoading` renamed to `isPending`\n- `cacheTime` renamed to `gcTime`\n- Stable Suspense support with `useSuspenseQuery`\n\n### Audio Player Component with Waveform\n\n**Recommendation: wavesurfer.js with @wavesurfer/react**\n\n```typescript\n// components/audio-player.tsx\nimport { useRef, useEffect, useState, useCallback } from 'react';\nimport
