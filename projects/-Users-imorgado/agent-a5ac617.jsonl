The latest release of the SDK is available at https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/premierepro.html.\n\n### Key APIs for Timeline/Sequence Work\n\n**Video Segment Suite**\nThis suite provides calls to parse a sequence and get details on video segments. All the queryable node properties are in PrSDKVideoSegmentProperties.h. These properties will be returned as PrSDKStrings, and should be managed using the String Suite.(no content)The segments provide a hash value that the caller can use to quickly determine whether or not a segment has changed. This hash value can be maintained even if a segment is shifted in time. In version 4, new in CS5.5, the new call AcquireNodeForTime() passes back a segment node for a requested time.(no content)To get a good idea of the segment structure, try the SDK player, create a sequence using the SDK Editing Mode, and watch the text overlay in the Sequence Monitor as you perform edits. See PrSDKVideoSegmentSuite.h and PrSDKVideoSegmentProperties.h.\n\n**Legacy Callback Suites**\nThe piSuites structure includes PlugTimelineFuncsPtr timelineFuncs for timeline operations, along with memory, window, ppix, and utility functions.\n\n**Time Handling**\nMost newer areas of the API use a tick-based time value that is stored in a signed 64-bit integer. Variables that use this new format are of type PrTime. When a frame rate is represented as a PrTime, the frame rate is the number of ticks in a frame duration. The current number of ticks per second must be retrieved using the callback in the Time Suite.\n\n**Sequence Info Suite**\nThe Sequence Info Suite now provides a call to get the sequence frame rate, which may be useful for effects.(no content)The Sequence Info Suite can retrieve the field type, zero point, and whether or not the timecode is drop-frame.\n\n### Working with Timeline Data\n\nStarting in Premiere Pro 1.5, the importer can get a frame from the timeline beneath the current clip or timeline location. This is useful for titler plugins. Use the getPreviewFrameEx callback with the time given by TDB_TimeRecord tdbTimelocation in imGetPrefsRec.\n\n### Community Resources\n\nThe premiere-plugin-guide GitHub repo hosts the Premiere C++ Plugin SDK Guide community docs.

On macOS, they have the file extension \".bundle\". Other supported plugin standards use their conventional file extensions: \".aex\" for After Effects plugins, \".dll\" for VST plugins.\n\n### Importers\n\nImporters provide video, audio and/or closed captioning from the media source. This source can be a single file, a set of files, a communication link between another application, etc. Standard importers appear as choices in the File > Import dialog, in the Files of type drop-down menu.(no content)Synthetic importers synthesize source material, rather than reading from disk. They appear in the File > New menu. Custom importers are a special type of synthetic importer, implemented to better support titlers. Custom importers can create files on disk; synthetic importers don't.\n\n### Transitions\n\nA transition plugin is a type of video effect that creates smooth movement between two video clips. Common transitions include: Fade In/Out – Gradual increase or decrease in opacity.(no content)Adobe has extended the After Effects API to support native transitions in Premiere Pro.\n\n### Effects and GPU Support\n\nGPU Extensions to existing APIs allow effects and transitions to access video frames in GPU memory, when using the Mercury Playback Engine in a GPU-accelerated mode.(no content)Premiere Pro supports third-party audio effects that use VST, VST3, and Audio Units (Audio Units is supported on macOS only).

On macOS, they have the file extension \".bundle\". Other supported plugin standards use their conventional file extensions: \".aex\" for After Effects plugins, \".dll\" for VST plugins.\n\n### Importers\n\nImporters provide video, audio and/or closed captioning from the media source. This source can be a single file, a set of files, a communication link between another application, etc. Standard importers appear as choices in the File > Import dialog, in the Files of type drop-down menu.(no content)Synthetic importers synthesize source material, rather than reading from disk. They appear in the File > New menu. Custom importers are a special type of synthetic importer, implemented to better support titlers. Custom importers can create files on disk; synthetic importers don't.\n\n### Transitions\n\nA transition plugin is a type of video effect that creates smooth movement between two video clips. Common transitions include: Fade In/Out – Gradual increase or decrease in opacity.(no content)Adobe has extended the After Effects API to support native transitions in Premiere Pro.\n\n### Effects and GPU Support\n\nGPU Extensions to existing APIs allow effects and transitions to access video frames in GPU memory, when using the Mercury Playback Engine in a GPU-accelerated mode.(no content)Premiere Pro supports third-party audio effects that use VST, VST3, and Audio Units (Audio Units is supported on macOS only). Premiere Pro supports these SDKs, and any effect written in those formats should work in Premiere Pro.\n\n### Exporters\n\nThe importer and exporter APIs have been extended to support closed captioning embedded in media.(no content)Exporters can now get the list of source pixel formats used by the clips in a sequence that is being smart rendered.\n\n### Plugin Architecture Details\n\nPremiere plugins contain a single entry point of a type specific to each API. Plugins are DLLs on Windows, and Carbon or Cocoa Bundles on macOS.(no content)Only one plugin per file is parsed, unlike After Effects and Photoshop plugins, which can contain multiple entry points.\n\n### Plugin Installation Location\n\nSupported Premiere and After Effects plugins installed in the common plugins folder will be loaded by Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition, and Media Encoder. Other plugin types, such as QuickTime and VfW codecs should be installed at the operating system level."],"durationSeconds":30.525475500000177}}

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)You can build performant plugins with modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. UXP is the next generation of APIs, for Premiere v25.6 and beyond.\n\n### UXP vs CEP (JavaScript Bridge Differences)\nUXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment, and you just need to require() the appropriate modules to access the APIs you need.(no content)UXP Plugins are also JavaScript/HTML/CSS based, however they are built on their own unique stack by Adobe which makes them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack. Additionally instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has 1 unified environment for your frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction back and forth.\n\n### C++ Hybrid Plugins\nUXP has the unique ability of including a C++ Hybrid plugin aspect to run computationally heavy tasks or interact with a host app's C++ APIs directly from the plugin. Note that UXP Hybrid plugins are not yet implemented in Premiere Pro but will be in the future.\n\n### C++ SDK (Native Plugins)\nYou can build powerful, low-level integrations using C++. The documentation is packaged with the SDK.(no content)The C++ SDK is complete, and used without issue by our C++ plugin developers. The C++ SDK does not contain any CEP or UXP resources.(no content)Many Premiere Pro plugins use the After Effects SDK — They may need the Premiere Pro headers.\n\n### API Behavior Differences\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous. This means they blocked the Premiere UI while they were executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition between the ExtendScript DOM and the UXP DOM, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### Getting Started\nUpdate your tools: Ensure you have Premiere v25.6 installed. You will also need the latest build, v2.2.1, of the UXP Developer Tools (UDT) to load, debug, and package your plugins. You can download the UDT through Creative Cloud Desktop.\n\n**Key Takeaway:** Currently, there is no direct bridge between UXP JavaScript plugins and C++ native plugins in Premiere Pro. The C++ SDK and UXP are separate systems.

On macOS, the minimum environment is Xcode 16.2 on macOS 15.4 or later. The SDK includes sample projects for these development environments.(no content)The sample code is written in C++. Other compilers and programming languages are not supported.\n\n### Official SDK Project Setup\n\n**Xcode Setup:**\nIn Xcode, set the build location for the project in File > Project Settings. Press the Advanced button. Under Build Location choose Custom, select Absolute, and set the Products path.\n\n**Visual Studio Setup:**\nIf you get \"Cannot open file '[MediaCore plugins path]plugin.prm'\", make sure to launch Visual Studio in administrator mode. In your Visual Studio installation, right-click devenv.exe, Properties > Compatibility > Privilege Level, click \"Run this program as an administrator\".\n\n### CMake for Cross-Platform Premiere Pro Plugin Development\n\nUnfortunately Adobe provides separate MSVC and Xcode project files, meaning additional build flags and dependencies (like third-party libraries) need to be manually added to each. CMake has become the default 'standard' for cross-platform builds; popularly for C and C++. There is a project that aims to be a good starter for cross-platform Premiere Pro plugin development, including those that have third-party dependencies.(no content)vcpkg is an open-source cross-platform library package management system from Microsoft; targeting macOS, Linux, and Windows. It's very popular, and has strong CMake integration. It is chosen for this project as an example of third-party library integration.(no content)Due to licensing issues, the Adobe SDK cannot be included directly. You must specify it in the build step with `-DADOBE_PP_SDK`.\n\n### General C++ CMake Project Structure\n\nThe main idea about project structure is that you have at least 2 folders: `include` and `src`. Headers files in include should be under folder named after your library domain.(no content)For cross-platform builds, CMake can make Xcode project from source code as well as Visual Studio project and so on.\n\n**To generate Xcode projects from CMake:**\nYou can launch cmake with the parameter `cmake ../Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Xcode` to generate an Xcode project.\n\n### Visual Studio CMake Integration\n\nVisual Studio's native support for CMake allows you to edit, build, and debug CMake projects on Windows, the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and remote systems from the same instance of Visual Studio. CMake project files (such as CMakeLists.txt) are consumed directly by Visual Studio for the purposes of IntelliSense and browsing.

The latest release of the SDK is available at the Adobe developer portal.\n\n### Key Sequence-Related Suites and Headers\n\n**PrSDKSequenceInfoSuite**\nNew in CS4, this suite provides calls to get the frame size and pixel aspect ratio of a sequence. This is useful for importers, transitions, or video filters that provide a custom setup dialog with a preview. See PrSDKSequenceInfoSuite.h.(no content)Version 2, new in CS5.5, adds GetFrameRate(). Version 3, new in CC, adds GetFieldType(), GetZeroPoint(), and GetTimecodeDropFrame().(no content)Sequence Info Suite is now at version 5, adding the new call GetImmersiveVideoVRConfiguration(), which returns the VR video settings of the specified sequence.\n\n**Video Segment Suite**\nThis suite provides calls to parse a sequence and get details on video segments. All the queryable node properties are in PrSDKVideoSegmentProperties.h. These properties will be returned as PrSDKStrings, and should be managed using the String Suite.

The latest release of the SDK is available at the Adobe developer portal.\n\n### Key Sequence-Related Suites and Headers\n\n**PrSDKSequenceInfoSuite**\nNew in CS4, this suite provides calls to get the frame size and pixel aspect ratio of a sequence. This is useful for importers, transitions, or video filters that provide a custom setup dialog with a preview. See PrSDKSequenceInfoSuite.h.(no content)Version 2, new in CS5.5, adds GetFrameRate(). Version 3, new in CC, adds GetFieldType(), GetZeroPoint(), and GetTimecodeDropFrame().(no content)Sequence Info Suite is now at version 5, adding the new call GetImmersiveVideoVRConfiguration(), which returns the VR video settings of the specified sequence.\n\n**Video Segment Suite**\nThis suite provides calls to parse a sequence and get details on video segments. All the queryable node properties are in PrSDKVideoSegmentProperties.h. These properties will be returned as PrSDKStrings, and should be managed using the String Suite. The segments provide a hash value that the caller can use to quickly determine whether or not a segment has changed.(no content)In version 4, new in CS5.5, the new call AcquireNodeForTime() passes back a segment node for a requested time.\n\n### Clip Manipulation APIs\n\nPrGPUFilterRenderParams has some attributes about an effect or transition, but many things, such as the parameters or duration of the clip to which the plugin is applied, are not found in that structure.

This means programmatically cutting or splitting clips is not currently available through UXP APIs.\n\n### What IS Available for TrackItem Manipulation\n\nPremiere APIs (DOM APIs) give you direct access to Premiere's document model. These APIs let you access and modify projects — sequences, tracks, clips, and markers; work with media — import files, manage project items; control playback — set in/out points, control the playhead; and apply effects — add video and audio effects to clips.\n\n**Available TrackItem operations include:**\n- New API to move a trackItem and new APIs to set the disabled state of a trackItem.\n- The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin shows how to clone and remove track items.\n- Duplicate trackItem using an insert or overwrite edit method to a destination track. Target track and start time of trackItem is determined using an offset value from the original trackItem position.\n- Placing trackItems in a sequence = no problem. This is the same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.\n\n### Getting Selected Clips\nThe `getSelection()` method returns currently-selected clips as an Array of TrackItems.

What is the Premiere Pro C++ SDK and Where to Download It\n\nThe **Adobe Premiere Pro Software Development Kit** enables developers to create native plugins for Premiere Pro, After Effects, Audition, Media Encoder, Character Animator, and Premiere Elements. The SDK allows building powerful, low-level integrations using C++.\n\n**Download Location:**\n- Primary source: [Adobe Developer Console](https://developer.adobe.com/console/servicesandapis/pr)\n- Alternative portal: https://www.adobe.io/apis/creativecloud/premierepro.html\n- Documentation is packaged with the SDK download\n\n**Important Note:** If you encounter \"Restricted Access\" errors when downloading, log in with a **Personal Adobe account** rather than a corporate account.\n\n**Community Documentation:** The [Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/) is a community-maintained living document that supplements the official documentation.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Plugin Types That Can Be Built\n\nThe C++ SDK supports the following plugin types:\n\n| Plugin Type | Purpose | File Extension |\n|-------------|---------|----------------|\n| **Importers** | Import video/audio media from files, streams, or generate synthetic content | .prm (Win), .bundle (macOS) |\n| **Exporters** | Save media to disk in various formats | .prm / .bundle |\n| **Export Controllers** | Drive exporters and perform post-processing (useful for asset management systems) | .prm / .bundle |\n| **Video Filters** | Process video frames with animatable parameters (Adobe recommends After Effects SDK instead) | .aex |\n| **GPU Effects & Transitions** | GPU-accelerated processing using CUDA, OpenCL, Metal, or OpenGL | .prm / .bundle |\n| **Transmitters** | Send video/audio/captions to external devices during playback and editing | .prm / .bundle |\n| **Control Surfaces** | Interface with hardware control surfaces for audio mixing, transport, and Lumetri Color panel | .prm / .bundle |\n\n**Additional supported formats:**\n- VST/VST3 audio effects\n- Audio Units (macOS only)\n- After Effects plugins (.aex) - Many Premiere plugins use the After Effects SDK with Premiere Pro headers\n\n---\n\n## 3. Timeline/Sequence Manipulation Capabilities (Critical Finding)\n\n**The C++ SDK does NOT provide direct timeline editing capabilities (cut, razor, split clips).**\n\nThis is a significant limitation. The C++ SDK is designed for:\n- **Media processing** (effects, transitions, filters)\n- **File I/O** (importers, exporters)\n- **Hardware integration** (transmitters, control surfaces)\n- **Reading sequence data** (querying, not modifying)\n\n**Adobe's Official Stance:**\nAccording to Adobe staff, the QE DOM APIs have had \"zero changes\" and \"no such changes are planned or scheduled.\" The QE DOM remains \"100% unsupported and not at all recommended.\"\n\n**For timeline editing operations**, Adobe directs developers to:\n- **UXP plugins** (JavaScript-based) - which can clone and remove track items\n- The `premiere_api` UXP example plugin demonstrates basic track item manipulation\n\n**Current UXP Limitations (as of December 2025):**\n- No UXP API mimics the razor tool for cutting/splitting clips\n- No API method exists to move clips vertically between tracks\n- Insert and overwrite edits are supported via `SequenceEditor.createInsertProjectItemAction()`\n\n---\n\n## 4. Key Classes/APIs for Sequence and Clip Manipulation in C++\n\nWhile the C++ SDK cannot **modify** timelines, it provides **read-only access** to sequence data through these suites:\n\n### Video Segment Suite\n- Header: `PrSDKVideoSegmentSuite.h`, `PrSDKVideoSegmentProperties.h`\n- **Purpose:** Parse sequences and retrieve details on video segments\n- **Key Features:**\n  - Returns a tree-based hierarchy: compositor nodes, clip nodes, media nodes, operators (effects)\n  - Provides hash values to detect segment changes\n  - `AcquireNodeForTime()` - retrieves segment node for a specific time (CS5.5+)\n\n### Sequence Info Suite\n- Header: `PrSDKSequenceInfoSuite.h`\n- **Purpose:** Retrieve sequence metadata\n- **Key Methods:**\n  - `GetFrameRate()` - sequence frame rate\n  - `GetFieldType()` - field type information\n  - `GetZeroPoint()` - timecode zero point\n  - `GetTimecodeDropFrame()` - drop-frame status\n  - `GetImmersiveVideoVRConfiguration()` - VR settings\n  - `GetWorkingColorSpace()` - color space ID\n\n### Clip Render Suite\n- **Purpose:** Request source frames directly from importers\n- **Key Features:**\n  - Discover supported frame sizes and pixel formats\n  - Synchronous and asynchronous frame retrieval\n  - `SupportsInitiateClipPrefetch()` - query prefetch support\n\n### Time Suite\n- **Purpose:** Convert between time representations\n- **Key Features:**\n  - Ticks per second calculations\n  - Video frame conversions\n  - Audio sample conversions\n  - Frame rate enumerations\n\n### Legacy Timeline Callbacks (piSuites)\n- `getClipVideo()` / `getClipVideoEx()` - retrieve frames from clips (superseded by Clip Render Suite)\n- `getCurrentTimebase()` - sequence timebase\n- `getCurrentPos()` - current time indicator position\n- `getWorkArea()` - work area start/end\n- `getPreviewFrameEx()` - fully rendered timeline frame\n\n### Marker Suite\n- **Purpose:** Read markers attached to sequences\n\n---\n\n## 5. C++ SDK Bridge/Communication with UXP JavaScript Plugins\n\n**Current State: No Direct Bridge Exists**\n\nThe C++ SDK and UXP are **separate, independent systems** with no built-in communication mechanism.\n\n| Technology | Characteristics |\n|------------|-----------------|\n| **C++ SDK** | Low-level media processing, native code, no UI API access |\n| **UXP** | JavaScript/HTML/CSS, direct DOM access, asynchronous, modern UI |\n| **CEP (Legacy)** | Node.js + Chromium, ExtendScript backend, CSInterface bridge |\n\n**UXP Hybrid Plugins (Future):**\nUXP has the architectural capability to include a \"C++ Hybrid plugin aspect to run computationally heavy tasks or interact with a host app's C++ APIs directly.\" However, **UXP Hybrid plugins are NOT yet implemented in Premiere Pro** but are planned for future releases.\n\n**Current Workarounds:**\n- File-based IPC (write/read files for data exchange)\n- External process communication via sockets\n- Shared memory approaches (complex, unsupported)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Project Structure for a C++ SDK Plugin\n\n### Standard SDK Project Structure\n\n```\nMyPlugin/\n├── Source/\n│   ├── MyPlugin.cpp          # Main entry point\n│   ├── MyPlugin.h            # Header file\n│   └── MyPluginPiPL.r        # Plugin Property List resource\n├── Headers/\n│   └── (SDK headers referenced)\n├── Resources/\n│   └── (Icon files, etc.)\n├── Build/\n│   ├── Win/\n│   │   └── MyPlugin.vcxproj  # Visual Studio project\n│   └── Mac/\n│       └── MyPlugin.xcodeproj # Xcode project\n└── Output/\n    └── MyPlugin.prm/.bundle\n```\n\n### Plugin Property List (PiPL) Resource\nEvery Premiere plugin requires a PiPL resource that defines:\n- Plugin type and version\n- Entry point name\n- Supported hosts\n- Resource flags\n\n### Key Files\n- **Entry Point:** Single entry point per plugin (unlike After Effects which supports multiple)\n- **Output Extension:** `.prm` (Windows), `.bundle` (macOS)\n\n---\n\n## 7. Build Tools Required\n\n### Windows\n- **Microsoft Visual Studio 2015 Update 3** (minimum required)\n- Windows 11 (required development environment)\n- Administrator mode may be required for debugging\n\n### macOS\n- **Xcode 16.2** (minimum required)\n- macOS 15.4 or later\n\n### CMake (Community Alternative)\nAdobe provides separate MSVC and Xcode project files. For cross-platform development, a community project exists:\n- [premiere-pro-cmake-plugin](https://github.com/SamuelMarks/premiere-pro-cmake-plugin)\n- Uses vcpkg for dependency management\n- Requires specifying SDK path: `-DADOBE_PP_SDK`\n\n**Generate Xcode from CMake:**\n```bash\ncmake ../Release -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -G Xcode\n```\n\n**Important:** The Adobe SDK cannot be redistributed due to licensing; it must be specified separately in build configuration.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Sample Projects Included in SDK\n\n| Sample | Description | Timeline Relevance |\n|--------|-------------|-------------------|\n| **SDK File Importer** | Supports .sdk files with 8-bit RGB/alpha and 10-bit YUV | None |\n| **Synth Import** | Generates synthetic 8-bit YUV/RGB video | None |\n| **SDK Custom Import** | Generates to disk, can display background timeline frames (for titlers) | Limited (read-only) |\n| **Export Controller** | Demonstrates File > Export menu integration | None |\n| **SDK Exporter** | Writes .sdk files with custom parameters, exports markers to HTML | None |\n| **Transmitter** | Sample A/V transmit plugin | None |\n| **SDK_ProcAmp** | GPU-accelerated ProcAmp effect (Metal support) | None |\n| **Vignette** | Vignette effect with CUDA and software paths | None |\n| **SDK_CrossDissolve** | GPU-accelerated cross dissolve transition (CUDA) | None |\n| **ControlSurface** | Hardware control surface integration | None |\n\n**None of the official sample projects demonstrate timeline/sequence manipulation** because the C++ SDK does not support those operations.\n\nFor timeline manipulation examples, refer to the UXP samples at [AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples), specifically the `premiere-api` sample which demonstrates track item cloning and removal.\n\n---\n\n## Summary and Recommendations\n\n### C++ SDK Is Appropriate For:\n- Custom video/audio effects and transitions\n- New file format importers/exporters\n- Hardware transmitters for external monitoring\n- Control surface integration\n- High-performance GPU-accelerated processing\n\n### C++ SDK Is NOT Appropriate For:\n- Timeline editing (cut, razor, split clips)\n- Moving clips between tracks\n- Sequence manipulation\n- Project organization automation\n\n### For Timeline Manipulation, Consider:\n1. **UXP plugins** (Premiere v25.6+) - Modern JavaScript-based approach with limited but growing timeline APIs\n2. **ExtendScript/CEP** (supported through September 2026) - Legacy but more feature-complete\n3. **Waiting for UXP Hybrid** - Future capability that will bridge UXP JavaScript with C++ code\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Premiere Pro C++ SDK Guide](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [Adobe Developer Portal - Premiere Pro](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/)\n- [Premiere Pro Plugin Types](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/intro/premiere-pro-plugin-types/)\n- [SweetPea Suites Documentation](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/universals/sweetpea-suites/)\n- [Sample Projects Documentation](https://ppro-plugins.docsforadobe.dev/intro/sample-projects/)\n- [Adobe Community - Timeline Editing API Request](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro Samples GitHub](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [premiere-pro-cmake-plugin GitHub](https://github.com/SamuelMarks/premiere-pro-cmake-plugin)\n- [GitHub - docsforadobe/premiere-plugin-guide](https://github.com/docsforadobe/premiere-plugin-guide)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":310,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1284,"cache_read_input_tokens":26243,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1284,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGgeBEvSMVZ2BaRmdz2t","type":"assistant","uuid":"c19b0a00-1382-4aaa-9085-7e55843fa954","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:35:03.285Z"}
