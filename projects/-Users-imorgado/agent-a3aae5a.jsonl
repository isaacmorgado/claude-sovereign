Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP and Razor Tool/Timeline Editing\n\n### UXP API Limitations for Razor Tool\n\nThere is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool. This was confirmed in an Adobe Community discussion from October 2025 where a developer was trying to build a Premiere Pro plugin with UXP.\n\nA developer was building a Premiere Pro plugin with UXP and faced challenges trying to mimic the razor tool feature. They wanted to programmatically create cut sections, add markers or tags to indicate which parts came from the original source, place them in a new sequence, export SRT files programmatically, and extract video metadata.\n\n### What UXP Can and Cannot Do\n\nAccording to the Adobe community response:\n\n- **Cannot do**: There is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool.\n- **Limitation**: In PPro, all markers and metadata associated with trackItems are actually attached to the backing projectItem; it's not possible to have different markers and metadata for each trackItem.\n- **Can do**: Placing trackItems in a sequence is no problem (same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP). Export .srt file is also possible - you would use an output preset (.epr file) that specifies whatever settings you want.\n\n### Standard Razor Tool Usage (Non-UXP)\n\nFor standard timeline editing in Premiere Pro:\n\n- Select the Razor tool on the panel, then select on the clip where you want to create a split.\n- You can type the letter C on your keyboard - that's the Razor tool shortcut in Premiere Pro.\n- Move the playhead and press Ctrl + K (Windows) or Cmd + K (Mac) for a quick cut. This splits the selected clip at that point so you can edit each part separately.\n- You can hold down the Alt key while using the Razor Tool to split only one track at a time. And if you hold down the Shift key, you can split all tracks simultaneously.\n\n### Undoing Razor Cuts\n\nRight click on the cut in the timeline and from the drop down menu choose \"Join Through Edits\" to undo a razor cut. Alternatively, just click on the cut and press the delete key. It will not delete the entire clip, just the cut.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"21020c9f-6896-4490-af0a-7c07b741c3a3","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:40:36.979Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"site:forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com Premiere Pro UXP split cut razor timeline editing","results":["I'll search for information about Premiere Pro UXP split cut razor timeline editing, but I should note that I cannot use the \"site:\" operator in my search.

The QE DOM has a `razor(string, bool, bool)` method on sequence and track objects, but some developers have reported difficulty getting it to work.\n\n### QE DOM Razor Method Example:\n\nHere's an example of using the QE DOM razor method to add cuts at markers:\n\n```javascript\nfunction addCutAtMarker(marker) {\n    var sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence(); // Get the active QE sequence\n    var timecode = marker.start.seconds; // Get the marker start time in seconds\n    \n    // Convert timecode to \"HH:MM:SS:FF\" format\n    var hours = Math.floor(timecode / 3600);\n    var minutes = Math.floor((timecode - (hours * 3600)) / 60);\n    var seconds = Math.floor(timecode - (hours * 3600) - (minutes * 60));\n    var frames = Math.floor((timecode - Math.floor(timecode)) * 24); // Assuming 24 fps\n    var timecodeString = padNumber(hours, 2) + \":\" + padNumber(minutes, 2) + \":\" + \n                         padNumber(seconds, 2) + \":\" + padNumber(frames, 2);\n    \n    // Apply the cut to all video tracks\n    for (var i = 0; i < sqe.numVideoTracks; i++) {\n        var videoTrack = sqe.getVideoTrackAt(i);\n        videoTrack.razor(timecodeString, true);\n    }\n    \n    // Apply the cut to all audio tracks\n    for (var i = 0; i < sqe.numAudioTracks; i++) {\n        var audioTrack = sqe.getAudioTrackAt(i);\n        audioTrack.razor(timecodeString, true);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Workarounds:\n\nIf the razor method doesn't work, a workaround is to use `overwriteClip()` with one-frame media and then delete that new media immediately, which results in two cut clips but with a one-frame gap. Another workaround is adjusting `inPoint`, `outPoint`, `start` and `end` properties, though the clip's `inPoint` and `outPoint` work in \"a strange nonobvious way,\" so testing is recommended first.\n\n### Documentation Challenges:\n\nAdobe has not done a complete job keeping documentation up-to-date.

While Illustrator has `app.executeMenuCommand()` and InDesign has `app.menuActions`, users have been looking for a similar API for Premiere Pro.(no content)Keyboard shortcuts are an option, but they can cause issues in localized environments. API access is much more preferred.\n\n### QE (Quality Engineering) DOM as an Alternative\nFor certain editing functions, the QE (Quality Engineering) library can provide alternatives. For example, users have found that calling the RAZOR method works for splitting clips. Sample code shows: `app.enableQE();` followed by `var sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence();` to get the active QE sequence.\n\n### CEP Panel Approach\nYou cannot directly assign an ExtendScript to a keyboard shortcut in Premiere. However, you can create a CEP HTML extension that can provide UI for your user (in the form of a dockable panel, or a floating window), or it can also have no visible UI.(no content)Once you have the HTML Panel running, you can communicate with Premiere using ExtendScript, which is the actual API to Premiere.

While Illustrator has `app.executeMenuCommand()` and InDesign has `app.menuActions`, users have been looking for a similar API for Premiere Pro.(no content)Keyboard shortcuts are an option, but they can cause issues in localized environments. API access is much more preferred.\n\n### QE (Quality Engineering) DOM as an Alternative\nFor certain editing functions, the QE (Quality Engineering) library can provide alternatives. For example, users have found that calling the RAZOR method works for splitting clips. Sample code shows: `app.enableQE();` followed by `var sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence();` to get the active QE sequence.\n\n### CEP Panel Approach\nYou cannot directly assign an ExtendScript to a keyboard shortcut in Premiere. However, you can create a CEP HTML extension that can provide UI for your user (in the form of a dockable panel, or a floating window), or it can also have no visible UI.(no content)Once you have the HTML Panel running, you can communicate with Premiere using ExtendScript, which is the actual API to Premiere. ExtendScript is very similar to JavaScript.\n\n### Important Note on ExtendScript's Future\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n### Resources\nThe PProPanel sample exercises Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API and can be found at: https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel.\n\nUnfortunately, there doesn't appear to be a `qe.app.triggerCommand` method or similar direct menu command execution API in Premiere Pro's ExtendScript.

This is a significant limitation for developers building Premiere Pro plugins with UXP who need to programmatically split clips.\n\n### Current UXP In/Out Point Capabilities\nAt the moment, it is possible to GET the inPoint and the outPoint of a clip located within a sequence on a video or audio track via: getStartTime(): Promise and getEndTime(): Promise. It is also possible to GET the inPoint and outPoint of the sequence itself: getInPoint(): Promise and getOutPoint(): Promise. However, I haven't been able to find a way to SET the inPoint and outPoint of the sequence.\n\n### Clip Trimming Challenges\nDevelopers have figured out how to set clip in/out points, hoping to use them to trim clips, but can't find any actions that might do that. There isn't any way to trim a clip in UXP currently. The move action seems to work, but there are no trimming actions on a clip, track, or sequence.\n\n### ExtendScript API (Legacy)\nIn ExtendScript, the inPoint is accessible via `app.project.sequences[index].audioTracks[index].clips[index].inPoint` or `app.project.sequences[index].videoTracks[index].clips[index].inPoint`. The in point set on the source for this trackItem instance, relative to the beginning of the source, is a Time object that is read/write.\n\n### Transition Timeline\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n### Workarounds Mentioned\nPlacing trackItems in a sequence is no problem, and this is the same for both CEP+ExtendScript and UXP. This suggests that instead of splitting clips with a razor-like function, developers may need to work around by creating new trackItems with adjusted in/out points to simulate the split effect.\n\n### Marker Limitations\nIn Premiere Pro, all markers and metadata associated with trackItems are actually attached to the backing projectItem; it's not possible to have different markers and metadata for each trackItem.\n\nIn summary, there's currently no direct UXP API to simulate the razor tool. The suggested workaround approach would involve cloning/placing clips with adjusted inPoint and outPoint values rather than actually splitting existing clips, though the full trimming capabilities are still limited in UXP.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"279ea348-b0b9-4511-9574-55487505cc43","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:44:19.903Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro UXP workaround split clone clip adjust inPoint outPoint simulate razor","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01JES39PjFUBV3LsgGG4kTu8","content":[{"title":"Solved: UXP: Razor tool and marking clipped sections - Adobe Product Community - 15547922","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-razor-tool-and-marking-clipped-sections/td-p/15547922"},{"title":"Setting sequence In/Out points via UXP: Is it possible? - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/setting-sequence-in-out-points-via-uxp-is-it-possible/10941"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Clip In/Out point usage in UXP / ripple trim - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/clip-in-out-point-usage-in-uxp-ripple-trim/10800"},{"title":"Solved: How can I copy sections of a clip from one sequenc... - Adobe Product Community - 13772123","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/how-can-i-copy-sections-of-a-clip-from-one-sequence-to-another/td-p/13772123"},{"title":"How to Split a Clip in Premiere Pro: An Easy Tutorial","url":"https://www.tourboxtech.com/en/news/how-to-split-a-clip-in-premiere-pro.html"},{"title":"The Top Five Tools for Fast Video Editing in Premiere Pro","url":"https://www.schoolofmotion.com/blog/top-five-tools-fast-video-editing-premiere-pro"},{"title":"How to Set In and Out Points for Clip Precision in Premiere Pro | Noble Desktop","url":"https://www.nobledesktop.com/learn/premiere-pro/how-to-set-in-and-out-points-for-clip-precision-in-premiere-pro"},{"title":"Set In and Out points in the Source Monitor","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/set-in-out-points-source-monitor.html"},{"title":"Cut clips in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere/desktop/edit-projects/trim-clips/cut-clips.html"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about Premiere Pro UXP workarounds for simulating the razor tool and working with clip inPoint/outPoint:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### No Native UXP Razor Tool API\nThere is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool.

Here's what I found:\n\n### Premiere Pro UXP API Overview\n\nUXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)The Premiere DOM can be accessed via UXP. From here, you can open documents, modify them, run menu items, and more.\n\n### Key Differences from ExtendScript\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous. This means they blocked the Premiere UI while they were executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread.\n\n### Regarding executeCommand\n\nFrom the After Effects context (which may differ from Premiere Pro): You can execute any menu commands with app.findMenuCommandId() and app.executeCommand(). However, note that those functions are not documented, so they are not supported officially.\n\n### \"Add Edit\" / Cut Command\n\nThe keyboard shortcut for \"Cut (Add Edit)\" is Ctrl + K / Cmd + K. This is the Premiere Pro timeline editing function that adds an edit point (cut) at the playhead position.\n\n### Current UXP Status\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP; Unified Extensibility Platform. ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.\n\n### Recommendation\n\nThe specific `app.executeCommand` method for running menu commands like \"Add Edit\" does not appear to be explicitly documented in the current UXP API documentation for Premiere Pro.

Here's what I discovered:\n\n## Using the Razor Method in Premiere Pro ExtendScript\n\nQE (Quality Engineering) is a hidden, undocumented API for Premiere Pro. It is used by Adobe to run automated tests for development purposes. Although it is not officially supported by Adobe, it is usable alongside the official API.\n\n### Basic Example\n\nHere is sample working code for using the razor method:\n\n```javascript\n// Enable Quality Engineering library\napp.enableQE();\n\n// Get the active QE sequence\nvar sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence();\n\n// We need the playertime, but not in the normal Time() format, \n// but rather in the format \"00:00:03:38\"\nvar playerTime = sqe.CTI.timecode;\n\n// QE has a razor method that can be called on a sequence object\n// Cut only on track\nsqe.getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(playerTime);\n\n// Cut on all tracks\nsqe.razor(playerTime);\n```\n\n### Cutting at a Specific Timecode with Conversion\n\nIf you need to convert seconds to timecode format (HH:MM:SS:FF), you can use code like this:\n\n```javascript\n// Function to add a cut at a marker\nfunction addCutAtMarker(marker) {\n    var sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence();\n    var timecode = marker.start.seconds;\n\n    // Convert the timecode to the format \"HH:MM:SS:FF\"\n    var hours = Math.floor(timecode / 3600);\n    var minutes = Math.floor((timecode - (hours * 3600)) / 60);\n    var seconds = Math.floor(timecode - (hours * 3600) - (minutes * 60));\n    var frames = Math.floor((timecode - Math.floor(timecode)) * 24); // Assuming 24 fps\n    var timecodeString = padNumber(hours, 2) + \":\" + padNumber(minutes, 2) + \":\" + \n                         padNumber(seconds, 2) + \":\" + padNumber(frames, 2);\n\n    // Apply the cut to all video tracks\n    for (var i = 0; i < sqe.numVideoTracks; i++) {\n        var videoTrack = sqe.getVideoTrackAt(i);\n        videoTrack.razor(timecodeString, true);\n    }\n\n    // Apply the cut to all audio tracks\n    for (var i = 0; i < sqe.numAudioTracks; i++) {\n        var audioTrack = sqe.getAudioTrackAt(i);\n        audioTrack.razor(timecodeString, true);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Using pymiere (Python Wrapper)\n\nIf you're using Python with pymiere, you can use code like this:\n\n```python\nimport pymiere\nfrom pymiere.wrappers import timecode_from_time\n\nseq = pymiere.objects.app.project.activeSequence\n# get player head time (could be any Time object)\ncurrent_time = seq.getPlayerPosition()\n# Time object to timecode string\ntimecode = timecode_from_time(current_time, seq)\n# razor tool on first video track at given timecode\npymiere.objects.qe.project.getActiveSequence().getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(timecode)\n```\n\n### Important Notes\n\n- There's no cut function in the standard ExtendScript API. The QE DOM has a razor(string, bool, bool) method on sequence and track objects.\n\n- There is no split method in the official API. As an alternative, you could truncate (change the end point) of the earlier trackItem, and insert a new trackItem (based on the same projectItem) at the end of the earlier trackItem.\n\n- A Time() object will perform timecode conversion for you. There are 254016000000 ticks/second.\n\n- No additional work is planned on the unsupported, undocumented PPro ExtendScript QE DOM.\n\n- As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"d047b011-046a-4bd4-9ba2-fa473e86b979","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:44:56.084Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro ExtendScript razor method qe sequence track timecode cut example","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Sz9pnyykmBtAJEJkBHFdeK","content":[{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Scripting ExtendScript question - Adobe Product Community - 13379442","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-extendscript-question/td-p/13379442"},{"title":"pymiere/example_and_documentation.md at master · qmasingarbe/pymiere","url":"https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere/blob/master/example_and_documentation.md"},{"title":"Solved: Perform a cut from script? - Adobe Product Community - 11389974","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/perform-a-cut-from-script/td-p/11389974"},{"title":"Samples/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx at master · Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx"},{"title":"Solved: Help Needed: ExtendScript to Cut Clips at Specific... - Adobe Product Community - 15109242","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/help-needed-extendscript-to-cut-clips-at-specific-timestamps/m-p/15109242"},{"title":"Solved: get specific sequence with qe dom, extendscript - Adobe Product Community - 11313652","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/get-specific-sequence-with-qe-dom-extendscript/td-p/11313652"},{"title":"Where is detailed docs about Premiere Pro Scripting DOM API? · Issue #80 · Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/issues/80"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/"},{"title":"ExtendScript Tutorial: Adding Effect to a Clip in Premiere Pro","url":"https://vakago-tools.com/extendscript-tutorial-adding-effect-to-a-clip-in-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Solved: Editing clips with ExtendScript - Adobe Product Community - 9056625","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/editing-clips-with-extendscript/td-p/9056625"}]},"Based on my search, I found excellent information about using the QE (Quality Engineering) API's razor method in Premiere Pro ExtendScript.

This release represents a major step forward in modernizing Adobe's extensibility ecosystem.(no content)UXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level. With UXP, you can build unique tools that integrate with and optimize the most precise, demanding workflows.\n\n## Timeline Editing API - Razor Tool and Split Functionality\n\nThere is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool. This is a significant limitation for developers wanting to programmatically split clips.\n\nThere is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks. Premiere Pro no longer includes a keyboard mappable command like Move Clip Up/Down Between Tracks, meaning even UI automation cannot rely on this.(no content)The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin, the right starting point for any future integrations, shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\n## Future Roadmap and Developer Input\n\nThis general release is just the beginning for UXP in Premiere. Adobe would love developer input to help prioritize what comes next. The Creative Cloud Developer Forums remain the best place to ask questions, help fellow developers, and — most importantly — tell them what you need. Developers are encouraged to share use cases, feedback, and feature requests on the forums. This input directly influences Adobe's roadmap and helps shape the platform.\n\n## ExtendScript Transition Timeline\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP. ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.(no content)No further changes or improvements to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled.\n\n## Key Technical Differences\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, blocking the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n## Summary\n\nCurrently, razor/split functionality is **not available** in the UXP API for Premiere Pro. Adobe is actively seeking developer feedback through the Creative Cloud Developer Forums to prioritize new features. The best approach for developers needing timeline editing capabilities is to participate in Adobe's forums and office hours to advocate for these features.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"53488d75-2fb2-4c3f-bd76-a9f8c831fecc","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:45:33.836Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro UXP future roadmap timeline editing API split razor Adobe roadmap 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01AVHE59SxByvK6B2LaxHePy","content":[{"title":"UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development"},{"title":"Request for Timeline Editing API Support (Clip Tra... - Adobe Product Community - 15624626","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Solved: UXP: Razor tool and marking clipped sections - Adobe Product Community - 15547922","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-razor-tool-and-marking-clipped-sections/td-p/15547922"},{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"UXP Roadmap - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-roadmap/6957"},{"title":"Solved: Adobe Illustrator UXP integration timeline / road ... - Adobe Product Community - 11379805","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/illustrator-discussions/adobe-illustrator-uxp-integration-timeline-road-map/td-p/11379805"},{"title":"Unlocking Agentic Video Editing: A Deep Dive into the Adobe Premiere Pro MCP Server","url":"https://skywork.ai/skypage/en/unlocking-video-editing-adobe-premiere/1981241710777434112"},{"title":"Premiere Pro feature summary (September 2025 release)","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/whats-new/2025-5.html"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found regarding Premiere Pro's UXP future roadmap and timeline editing API support:\n\n## UXP Status in Premiere Pro\n\nThe Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP) has officially graduated from beta and is now available in Adobe Premiere 25.6!

OFFICIAL CONFIRMATION: No UXP Razor/Split API Exists\n\n**Adobe has explicitly confirmed**: \"There is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool.\"\n- Source: [Adobe Community - UXP Razor Tool Discussion](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-razor-tool-and-marking-clipped-sections/td-p/15547922)\n\n---\n\n### 2. SequenceEditor Class - Complete Method List\n\nThe SequenceEditor class provides these methods (none create cuts/splits):\n\n| Method | Purpose | Can Split? |\n|--------|---------|------------|\n| `createInsertProjectItemAction(projectItem, time, videoTrackIndex, audioTrackIndex, limitShift)` | Insert clip into sequence | No |\n| `createOverwriteItemAction(projectItem, time, videoTrackIndex, audioTrackIndex)` | Overwrite with clip | No |\n| `createRemoveItemsAction(trackItemSelection, ripple, mediaType, shiftOverLapping?)` | Remove/ripple delete items | No |\n| `createCloneTrackItemAction(trackItem, timeOffset, videoTrackVerticalOffset, audioTrackVerticalOffset, alignToVideo, isInsert)` | Duplicate existing clip | **Potential workaround** |\n| `insertMogrtFromPath(...)` | Insert Motion Graphics template | No |\n| `insertMogrtFromLibrary(...)` | Insert mogrt from library | No |\n| `getLocalMogrtPath()` | Get mogrt directory | No |\n\nSource: [SequenceEditor Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/sequenceeditor/), [types.d.ts on GitHub](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)\n\n---\n\n### 3. TrackItem Manipulation Methods\n\n**VideoClipTrackItem / AudioClipTrackItem methods:**\n\n| Method | Purpose | Enables Split? |\n|--------|---------|----------------|\n| `getInPoint()` / `getOutPoint()` | Get source in/out points | Read only |\n| `getStartTime()` / `getEndTime()` | Get sequence position | Read only |\n| `createSetInPointAction(tickTime)` | Set source in point | **BROKEN** - returns empty actions |\n| `createSetOutPointAction(tickTime)` | Set source out point | **BROKEN** - returns empty actions |\n| `createSetStartAction(tickTime)` | Set sequence start time | **Works** - can resize |\n| `createSetEndAction(tickTime)` | Set sequence end time | **Works** - can resize |\n| `createMoveAction(tickTime)` | Move clip position | Works |\n| `createSetDisabledAction(disabled)` | Enable/disable clip | No |\n| `createSetNameAction(inName)` | Rename clip | No |\n| `getProjectItem()` | Get source project item | No |\n\n**Critical Finding**: `createSetInPointAction` and `createSetOutPointAction` are currently broken per Adobe staff.\n\nSource: [Clip In/Out point usage in UXP](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/clip-in-out-point-usage-in-uxp-ripple-trim/10800)\n\n---\n\n### 4. performSceneEditDetectionOnSelection - Potential Cut Method\n\n```typescript\nperformSceneEditDetectionOnSelection(clipOperation: string, trackItemSelection: TrackItemSelection): Promise<boolean>\n```\n\n**ClipOperation constants:**\n- `SEQUENCE_OPERATION_APPLYCUT` - \"ApplyCuts\"\n- `SEQUENCE_OPERATION_CREATEMARKER` - \"CreateMarkers\"  \n- `SEQUENCE_OPERATION_CREATESUBCLIP` - \"CreateSubclips\"\n\n**Limitation**: This performs AI-based scene edit detection on selected clips - it does NOT allow arbitrary cut placement. It only detects existing scene changes and applies cuts there.\n\nSource: [types.d.ts](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)\n\n---\n\n### 5. Razor Events (Not Methods)\n\nThe API includes these **event constants** (for listening, not executing):\n- `EVENT_SNAP_RAZOR_TO_PLAYHEAD` - Fired when razor tool snaps to playhead\n- `EVENT_SNAP_RAZOR_TO_MARKER` - Fired when razor tool snaps to markers\n\nThese are **read-only events** - you cannot trigger razor cuts through them.\n\n---\n\n### 6. Potential Workaround: Clone + Adjust Endpoints\n\n**Theoretical approach to simulate a split:**\n\n1. Use `createCloneTrackItemAction()` to duplicate the clip\n2. On original clip: use `createSetEndAction()` to trim to cut point\n3. On cloned clip: use `createSetStartAction()` to start at cut point\n4. Position cloned clip using `createMoveAction()`\n\n**Problems with this approach:**\n- `createSetInPointAction` and `createSetOutPointAction` are broken\n- `createSetStartAction` and `createSetEndAction` work but change sequence position, not source trim\n- No way to properly adjust source in/out points on cloned clip\n- Would leave gaps or overlaps\n\nSource: [Trim/Ripple Delete Forum](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/how-do-i-trim-ripple-delete-a-part-of-a-sequence/10426)\n\n---\n\n### 7. Adobe Staff Statements on Trimming API\n\nAdobe developer **dan2dublin** stated:\n> \"We have not exposed API for trimming a trackItem _yet_.\"\n\nAdobe acknowledged this as a priority gap for achieving CEP/UXP parity.\n\n**Workaround suggested by Adobe**: Use `createSetStartAction` and `createSetEndAction` instead of in/out point methods.\n\nSource: [Clip In/Out point usage in UXP](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/clip-in-out-point-usage-in-uxp-ripple-trim/10800)\n\n---\n\n### 8. No Menu Command Execution API\n\nUnlike After Effects (`app.executeCommand`) or Illustrator (`app.executeMenuCommand`), Premiere Pro has **no API to execute menu commands** like \"Add Edit\" (Ctrl+K).\n\nAdobe employee confirmed: \"No, there is no such API.\"\n\nSource: [Execute Menu Command Discussion](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/q-execute-menu-command-from-script-cep-extendscript/td-p/9853026)\n\n---\n\n### 9. ExtendScript QE DOM (Legacy - Deprecated)\n\nThe **only working programmatic razor method** exists in the **unsupported QE DOM** (ExtendScript):\n\n```javascript\napp.enableQE();\nvar sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence();\nvar playerTime = sqe.CTI.timecode; // Format: \"00:00:03:38\"\n\n// Razor single track\nsqe.getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(playerTime);\n\n// Razor all tracks  \nsqe.razor(playerTime);\n```\n\n**Status**: \n- Works in ExtendScript/CEP\n- **NOT available in UXP**\n- ExtendScript supported until September 2026\n- No additional QE DOM improvements planned\n\nSource: [Perform a cut from script](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/perform-a-cut-from-script/td-p/11389974), [pymiere documentation](https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere/blob/master/example_and_documentation.md)\n\n---\n\n### 10. GitHub Issues & Feature Requests\n\n**Active community requests for timeline editing APIs:**\n- [Request for Timeline Editing API Support](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115)\n- Multiple forum posts requesting razor/split functionality\n\n**Adobe's response**: They encourage developers to submit feature requests via Creative Cloud Developer Forums to influence the roadmap.\n\n---\n\n### 11. Future Roadmap\n\nFrom December 2025 Adobe blog post:\n> \"This general release is just the beginning for UXP in Premiere. We would love your input to help prioritize what comes next.\"\n\n**No specific timeline** for razor/split API has been announced.\n\nSource: [UXP Arrives in Premiere Blog Post](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n\n---\n\n## SUMMARY TABLE: All Potential Approaches\n\n| Approach | Available in UXP? | Works? | Notes |\n|----------|-------------------|--------|-------|\n| Direct razor/split API | No | N/A | Does not exist |\n| Clone + adjust in/out points | Partial | **No** | In/out point actions broken |\n| Clone + adjust start/end times | Yes | **Partial** | Changes position, not trim points |\n| Scene edit detection with ApplyCuts | Yes | **Limited** | Only detects existing scene changes |\n| Menu command execution | No | N/A | No API exists |\n| QE DOM razor() method | ExtendScript only | Yes | Not available in UXP |\n| Keyboard shortcut simulation | No | N/A | No API in UXP |\n\n---\n\n## CONCLUSION\n\n**There is currently NO way to directly cut/split/razor clips on the Premiere Pro timeline using UXP.**\n\n**Best current options:**\n1. Use ExtendScript/CEP with QE DOM `razor()` method (supported until Sept 2026)\n2. Wait for Adobe to add trimming/split APIs to UXP\n3.
