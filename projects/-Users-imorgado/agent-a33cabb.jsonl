This moment has been long-awaited by Premiere plugin developers since UXP was originally announced by Adobe back in 2019.(no content)UXP is the current extensibility standard for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, supported by a constantly growing set of applications, including Premiere (version 25.6), Photoshop, and InDesign.\n\n## Networking Capabilities in UXP\n\nUXP provides file system, networking, shell execution, and core UXP functionality.(no content)Network I/O is accomplished using the XMLHttpRequest, fetch, and WebSocket APIs.\n\n### WebSocket Support\n\nWebSocket provides the API for creating and managing a WebSocket connection to a server, as well as for sending and receiving data on the connection. In order to leverage WebSocket, update the manifest.json with the network.domains permission.(no content)From UXP v7.4.0 onwards `permissions.network.domains` does not support WildCards in top-level domains.\n\n### WebSocket as Client (Not Server)\n\nIt's important to note that UXP's WebSocket implementation is for **client connections** - connecting to external servers - rather than hosting a WebSocket server within the plugin itself.\n\n## Third-Party Solutions for Server Capabilities\n\nSeveral projects have emerged to bridge this gap using proxy servers:\n\nAdobe MCP provides real-time communication via WebSocket-based proxy for instant command execution.(no content)These solutions bridge Adobe Creative Suite applications including Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and InDesign through WebSocket connections and UXP plugins, enabling natural language control.\n\n## Key Limitations\n\nUXP does not support the HTTP/HTTP2 event source. Some developers have also reported issues trying to use WebSocket to connect.(no content)While UXP lets you use Web technologies, it is not conceived to be a standard browser environment or replacement; not all features that a browser natively supports will work in UXP.\n\n## Summary\n\nUXP in Premiere Pro (as of version 25.6, beta since December 2024) supports:\n- **WebSocket client connections** (connecting TO external servers)\n- **Fetch API and XMLHttpRequest** for HTTP requests\n- Network permissions configured via manifest.json\n\nHowever, UXP does **not** natively support:\n- Running a WebSocket **server** within the plugin\n- Running an HTTP **server** within the plugin\n\nFor server functionality, developers typically use external proxy servers that communicate with the UXP plugin via client-side WebSocket or HTTP connections.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0012173a-9889-46e9-85ca-c11d07560bf9","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:43:22.678Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"UXP Adobe Premiere Pro WebSocket server HTTP server networking capabilities 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01GMQqKsUVzmSiFS9TNVsMKR","content":[{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Adobe","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-js/Global%20Members/Data%20Transfers/WebSocket/"},{"title":"UXP Web socket under HTTP/2? - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-web-socket-under-http-2/5803"},{"title":"Adobe MCP - Unified MCP Server for Adobe Creative Suite | MCP Servers · LobeHub","url":"https://lobehub.com/mcp/yourusername-adobe-mcp"},{"title":"Adobe Premiere Pro MCP Server by hetpatel-11 | PulseMCP","url":"https://www.pulsemcp.com/servers/adobe-premiere-pro"},{"title":"Premiere and UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/"},{"title":"Solved: UXP current status for premiere? - Adobe Product Community - 12121301","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-current-status-for-premiere/td-p/12121301"},{"title":"Announcing UXP in Photoshop.

In order to leverage WebSocket, update the manifest.json with the network.domains permission.(no content)From UXP v7.4.0 onwards `permissions.network.domains` does not support WildCards in top-level domains.\n\n### WebSocket as Client (Not Server)\n\nIt's important to note that UXP's WebSocket implementation is for **client connections** - connecting to external servers - rather than hosting a WebSocket server within the plugin itself.\n\n## Third-Party Solutions for Server Capabilities\n\nSeveral projects have emerged to bridge this gap using proxy servers:\n\nAdobe MCP provides real-time communication via WebSocket-based proxy for instant command execution.(no content)These solutions bridge Adobe Creative Suite applications including Photoshop, Premiere Pro, and InDesign through WebSocket connections and UXP plugins, enabling natural language control.\n\n## Key Limitations\n\nUXP does not support the HTTP/HTTP2 event source. Some developers have also reported issues trying to use WebSocket to connect.(no content)While UXP lets you use Web technologies, it is not conceived to be a standard browser environment or replacement; not all features that a browser natively supports will work in UXP.\n\n## Summary\n\nUXP in Premiere Pro (as of version 25.6, beta since December 2024) supports:\n- **WebSocket client connections** (connecting TO external servers)\n- **Fetch API and XMLHttpRequest** for HTTP requests\n- Network permissions configured via manifest.json\n\nHowever, UXP does **not** natively support:\n- Running a WebSocket **server** within the plugin\n- Running an HTTP **server** within the plugin\n\nFor server functionality, developers typically use external proxy servers that communicate with the UXP plugin via client-side WebSocket or HTTP connections."],"durationSeconds":25.481050125000067}}

For example, sending a PSD into Substance Designer or 3D Coat, or telling a game engine to import a PSD as a texture.

However, you can use websockets in UXP to communicate with other applications and processes. For examples, see the `desktop-helper-sample` and `io-websocket-sample` on GitHub.\n\n### Communication Methods Available\n\n1. **Fetch API**: UXP provides a fetch method globally, matching HTML DOM fetch method. See the `web-service-call-js-sample` for an example plugin that communicates with a web server.\n\n2. **OAuth Support**: You can use OAuth to connect to any supporting service that supports it, and provide online functionality in your plugin.

You can do this by adding the network object to the requiredPermissions section of the manifest.\n\nThe configuration structure looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": [\n        \"https://www.adobe.com\",\n        \"https://*.adobeprerelease.com\",\n        \"wss://*.myplugin.com\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis specifies the domains that the plugin can access in network requests. You can also allow access to all domains by setting domains to \"all\".\n\n### Important Limitations\n\nFrom UXP v7.4.0 onwards, `permissions.network.domains` does not support wildcards in top-level domains.\n\nFor example, domains like `\"https://www.adobe.*\"` or `\"https://www.*\"` are not valid.\n\n### WebSocket Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nvar ws = new WebSocket(\"wss://demos.kaazing.com/echo\", \"wss\");\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n\nTo ensure that plugins are secure, UXP requires that plugins declare the permissions they need to function. Make sure you configure the most accurate permission for your use case because in the future users will be asked to provide their consent based on it. For example, for file operations, you may find 'fullAccess' to be the least restrictive and hence the easiest to pick, but a user may not be comfortable giving full access to their system unless it's absolutely necessary.(no content)Within the \"network\" property under the \"requiredPermissions\" property, you can define an array of \"domains\" to which the plugin will grant permission.

You can do this by adding the network object to the requiredPermissions section of the manifest.\n\nThe configuration structure looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": [\n        \"https://www.adobe.com\",\n        \"https://*.adobeprerelease.com\",\n        \"wss://*.myplugin.com\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThis specifies the domains that the plugin can access in network requests. You can also allow access to all domains by setting domains to \"all\".\n\n### Important Limitations\n\nFrom UXP v7.4.0 onwards, `permissions.network.domains` does not support wildcards in top-level domains.\n\nFor example, domains like `\"https://www.adobe.*\"` or `\"https://www.*\"` are not valid.\n\n### WebSocket Usage Example\n\n```javascript\nvar ws = new WebSocket(\"wss://demos.kaazing.com/echo\", \"wss\");\n```\n\n### Best Practices\n\nTo ensure that plugins are secure, UXP requires that plugins declare the permissions they need to function. Make sure you configure the most accurate permission for your use case because in the future users will be asked to provide their consent based on it. For example, for file operations, you may find 'fullAccess' to be the least restrictive and hence the easiest to pick, but a user may not be comfortable giving full access to their system unless it's absolutely necessary.(no content)Within the \"network\" property under the \"requiredPermissions\" property, you can define an array of \"domains\" to which the plugin will grant permission. While you can also use \"domains\": \"all\" to allow access to any domain on the internet, it is a better practice to specify only the domains necessary for your plugin.\n\n### Manifest Version Notes\n\nStarting with v5, any permissions not explicitly declared in the manifest are not granted by default. In order for your plugin to use the network, you must define domains that your plugin will access by adding the network object to the requiredPermissions section of the manifest."],"durationSeconds":21.536446750000003}}

This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes.(no content)With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment, and you just need to require() the appropriate modules to access the APIs you need.\n\n## UXP Hybrid Plugins (C++ Integration)\n\nA UXP Hybrid plugin is a UXP plugin combined with the power of C++ native libraries. Take advantage of more performant C++ code to enhance your plugins.(no content)The SDKs are labeled with a UXP version, as the UXP hybrid plugin SDK is designed to be app-independent. In the future, you will be able to use the same SDK to build plugins for other UXP-based applications.\n\n## UXP Core APIs\n\nThe UXP platform provides two complementary sets of APIs: UXP Core APIs: for building user interfaces, file operations, network calls, and general functionality.(no content)The UXP framework focuses on modern development practices, offering tools to build high-performance, native-like plugins. Direct API access to application functionalities. Improved performance over CEP. Support for asynchronous programming.\n\n## BatchPlay for Extended Access\n\nIf there is something your plugin or script needs to do that is not exposed in the current DOM, you may be able to use batchPlay. BatchPlay is for accessing Photoshop functionality that has not yet been exposed via APIs.\n\n## Recent Updates (2024-2025)\n\nOn November 15th, 2024, Adobe stopped accepting new plugins for Adobe XD in their Marketplace.

This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes.(no content)With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment, and you just need to require() the appropriate modules to access the APIs you need.\n\n## UXP Hybrid Plugins (C++ Integration)\n\nA UXP Hybrid plugin is a UXP plugin combined with the power of C++ native libraries. Take advantage of more performant C++ code to enhance your plugins.(no content)The SDKs are labeled with a UXP version, as the UXP hybrid plugin SDK is designed to be app-independent. In the future, you will be able to use the same SDK to build plugins for other UXP-based applications.\n\n## UXP Core APIs\n\nThe UXP platform provides two complementary sets of APIs: UXP Core APIs: for building user interfaces, file operations, network calls, and general functionality.(no content)The UXP framework focuses on modern development practices, offering tools to build high-performance, native-like plugins. Direct API access to application functionalities. Improved performance over CEP. Support for asynchronous programming.\n\n## BatchPlay for Extended Access\n\nIf there is something your plugin or script needs to do that is not exposed in the current DOM, you may be able to use batchPlay. BatchPlay is for accessing Photoshop functionality that has not yet been exposed via APIs.\n\n## Recent Updates (2024-2025)\n\nOn November 15th, 2024, Adobe stopped accepting new plugins for Adobe XD in their Marketplace. Existing published plugins can continue to be managed and updated via the Developer Distribution portal.\n\nThe search results didn't directly address middleware solutions for exposing UXP plugin APIs to external applications. You may need to explore WebSocket servers within UXP plugins or custom HTTP server implementations for bridging external apps to UXP functionality."],"durationSeconds":23.04651658299996}}

ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n## CEP vs UXP: Key Differences\n\n### Architecture\nCEP Extensions are comprised of a JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend built on Node.js + Chromium frontend (similar to NW.js) and an ExtendScript backend for interacting with the host application.(no content)UXP Plugins are also JavaScript/HTML/CSS based, however they are built on their own unique stack by Adobe which makes them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack. Additionally instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has 1 unified environment for your frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction back and forth.\n\n### Synchronous vs Asynchronous\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous. This means they blocked the Premiere UI while they were executing.\n\n### ExtendScript Limitations\nExtendScript is Adobe's custom flavor of JavaScript, which is based off of the much older ES3 version of JavaScript (released in 1999). This means the latest ES6 features such as arrow functions, the const and let keywords, modern array functions, and more are not available.\n\n## HTTP/Socket Communication\n\nSince extensions are written in modern JavaScript, you can use any number of modern web communications including Fetch API or WebSockets depending on your needs. This applies to the JavaScript layer of CEP extensions (not ExtendScript) and to UXP.\n\n## Migration Timeline\n\nWe don't have a clear answer on this from Adobe yet, but developers have been assured that they should have \"several years\" to complete migration once UXP is out of beta and ready for general release.(no content)All Adobe applications are replacing CEP extension support with UXP plugin support; schedules vary by application. No CEP removal is currently scheduled.(no content)No further changes or improvements to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nCEP and UXP each have their pros and cons, but the important thing to note is that UXP is replacing CEP so tracking with UXP updates is very important for all Adobe 3rd party developers.(no content)The majority of what was possible via CEP+ExtendScript is now possible using UXP.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"99857010-9c47-473b-9c5c-c759534d16ba","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:46:01.683Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe Premiere Pro CEP vs UXP server HTTP socket ExtendScript 2024","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01NrCfPK2EUjRnVTmGmbGmpv","content":[{"title":"Premiere Pro UXP Beta — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Extensions - To UXP or not to UXP - Adobe Product Community - 11326933","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-extensions-to-uxp-or-not-to-uxp/td-p/11326933"},{"title":"UXP vs CEP - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-vs-cep/9643"},{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"Scripting Changes in Adobe’s Video Applications | by Bruce Bullis | Adobe Tech Blog | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/adobetech/scripting-changes-in-adobes-video-applications-1bee1fc0fe47"},{"title":"Building Adobe Extensions — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/building-adobe-extensions/"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Scripts vs Extensions vs Plugins — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/scripts-extensions-plugins/"},{"title":"Solved: UXP current status for premiere? - Adobe Product Community - 12121301","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-current-status-for-premiere/td-p/12121301"},{"title":"Extendscript hit the ground running | Pixel-Nexus","url":"https://pixel-nexus.com/extendscript_hit_the_ground_running.html"}]},"Here's what I found about Adobe Premiere Pro CEP vs UXP, server HTTP socket, and ExtendScript in 2024:\n\n## Current Status of UXP in Premiere Pro\n\nOn Dec 5th, 2024, Adobe opened their public beta for UXP Plugins in Premiere Pro.(no content)This moment has been long-awaited by Premiere plugin developers since UXP was originally announced by Adobe back in 2019 and has since made its way into Photoshop and InDesign.(no content)As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).

You can take advantage of more performant C++ code to enhance your plugins.(no content)The concept of a hybrid plugin is very similar to Node.js C++ Addons. The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.(no content)The C++ code is distributed with and runs alongside the JavaScript code. Communication between the two happens via an API layer modeled against NodeJS N-API.\n\n## Socket Communication in UXP\n\nThe search results reveal some challenges with socket implementations in UXP:\n\nUXP does not support the HTTP/HTTP2 event source. Developers have also tried to use WebSocket to connect without any luck.(no content)When using the 'helper' and 'uxp' components in the 'AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/desktop-helper-sample' project on Windows, they both establish connections without any issues. However, upon closing the 'helper,' you may encounter an error message: \"Uncaught Error: The web socket is already closed.\" To re-establish the connection, you'll need to restart Photoshop.\n\n## Requirements and Considerations\n\nTo build and test your plugins, you will need at least Photoshop v24.2.0 and UDT v1.7.0.

You can take advantage of more performant C++ code to enhance your plugins.(no content)The concept of a hybrid plugin is very similar to Node.js C++ Addons. The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.(no content)The C++ code is distributed with and runs alongside the JavaScript code. Communication between the two happens via an API layer modeled against NodeJS N-API.\n\n## Socket Communication in UXP\n\nThe search results reveal some challenges with socket implementations in UXP:\n\nUXP does not support the HTTP/HTTP2 event source. Developers have also tried to use WebSocket to connect without any luck.(no content)When using the 'helper' and 'uxp' components in the 'AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/desktop-helper-sample' project on Windows, they both establish connections without any issues. However, upon closing the 'helper,' you may encounter an error message: \"Uncaught Error: The web socket is already closed.\" To re-establish the connection, you'll need to restart Photoshop.\n\n## Requirements and Considerations\n\nTo build and test your plugins, you will need at least Photoshop v24.2.0 and UDT v1.7.0. To publish and distribute your plugin, Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop v5.10 is required.(no content)Currently, hybrid plugins are only supported in Photoshop.(no content)With the hybrid plugins, Adobe has relaxed the UXP sandbox restrictions.\n\n## Development Resources\n\n- Hybrid plugins combine the best of both worlds: A single plugin may use both native code and UXP UI elements.

Can UXP Extensions in Premiere Pro Host a WebSocket Server or HTTP Server?\n\n**No, UXP cannot host servers.** UXP is designed as a client-only networking environment. The WebSocket API in UXP only supports client connections (connecting TO external servers), not hosting a WebSocket or HTTP server within the plugin itself.\n\nKey limitation from the forums: \"The only socket connection that you can open from JavaScript is WebSocket\" - and this is client-mode only.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Network APIs Available in UXP\n\nUXP provides three network APIs in the global scope (no require needed):\n\n| API | Supported | Notes |\n|-----|-----------|-------|\n| **fetch** | Yes | Standard Fetch API, similar to browser |\n| **XMLHttpRequest** | Yes | Full XHR support |\n| **WebSocket** | Yes (Client only) | Full WebSocket API except extensions handling |\n| **HTTP Server** | No | Not available |\n| **Raw TCP Sockets** | No | Intentionally blocked for security |\n| **HTTP/2 Event Source** | No | Not supported |\n\n**Manifest Configuration Required (v5+):**\n```json\n{\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": [\n        \"https://api.example.com\",\n        \"wss://socket.example.com\",\n        \"http://127.0.0.1:11434\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Important Notes:**\n- Use `\"domains\": \"all\"` for unrestricted access\n- From UXP v7.4.0+, wildcards in TLDs are not supported\n- Use IP addresses (`127.0.0.1`) instead of `localhost` for local connections\n- HTTP protocol only works on Windows, not macOS in Photoshop\n\n---\n\n### 3. Workarounds to Expose UXP Functionality to External Clients\n\nSince UXP cannot receive incoming connections, the recommended patterns are:\n\n**A. External Middleware Server Pattern (Recommended)**\n```\nExternal Client <-> Middleware Server (Node.js/Python) <-> UXP Plugin (WebSocket Client)\n```\n- Run a WebSocket/HTTP server externally (Node.js, Python, etc.)\n- UXP plugin connects as a WebSocket client\n- External clients connect to the middleware server\n- Middleware relays messages between clients and UXP\n\n**B. Desktop Helper App Pattern (Adobe's Official Sample)**\nThe `desktop-helper-sample` demonstrates:\n- Electron app running a socket.io server\n- UXP plugin connects as socket.io client\n- Enables external process communication\n\n**C. Polling Pattern**\n- UXP plugin periodically fetches from an external API\n- External clients post commands to that API\n- Less responsive but simpler architecture\n\n**D. UXP Hybrid Plugin (C++ Native)**\n- Photoshop only (currently)\n- C++ code can potentially implement socket servers\n- Communicate with JavaScript via N-API layer\n- More complex but bypasses UXP sandbox restrictions\n\n---\n\n### 4. How UXP Plugins in Photoshop Handle Remote Connections\n\nPhotoshop UXP plugins use the same networking model as Premiere Pro. Adobe provides official samples:\n\n| Sample | Description | Use Case |\n|--------|-------------|----------|\n| `desktop-helper-sample` | Electron + socket.io helper app | Communication with external processes |\n| `io-websocket-sample` | WebSocket client/server demo | Bidirectional messaging |\n| `web-service-call-js-sample` | Fetch API usage | REST API integration |\n| `oauth-workflow-sample` | OAuth flow implementation | Third-party service auth |\n\n**Key Architecture:** The plugin initiates outbound WebSocket connections to external servers; it never receives incoming connections directly.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Is There Any Way to Receive Incoming Connections in UXP?\n\n**No direct way exists.** UXP intentionally restricts this for security (browser-derived security model).\n\n**Closest alternatives:**\n\n1. **Hybrid Plugin (C++):** Implement a native socket server in C++ and expose via N-API (Photoshop only, not available for Premiere Pro yet)\n\n2. **External Process Bridge:** Run a separate process that:\n   - Listens for incoming connections\n   - The UXP plugin connects to it as a client\n   - Messages are relayed bidirectionally\n\n3. **CEP Extensions (Legacy):** CEP extensions have access to Node.js and can host servers, but CEP is being deprecated in favor of UXP\n\n---\n\n### 6. Forum Discussions About Server-Side Capabilities\n\nKey discussions from Adobe Developer Forums:\n\n**\"Communicate with other apps over TCP is Impossible?\"** (Feb 2023)\n- Confirms raw TCP sockets are intentionally blocked\n- Workaround: Use middleware WebSocket server as a bridge\n- [Forum Link](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/communicate-with-other-apps-over-tcp-is-impossible/5908)\n\n**\"UXP Web socket under HTTP/2?\"** \n- Confirms HTTP/2 event source not supported\n- WebSocket connection issues reported\n- [Forum Link](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-web-socket-under-http-2/5803)\n\n**\"Uxp use socket to communicate with external programs issue\"**\n- References desktop-helper-sample for external communication\n- Notes connection stability issues on Windows\n- [Forum Link](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-use-socket-to-communicate-with-external-programs-issue/6991)\n\n---\n\n### Summary Table\n\n| Capability | UXP Support | Workaround |\n|------------|-------------|------------|\n| Outbound HTTP (fetch) | Yes | - |\n| Outbound WebSocket | Yes | - |\n| Inbound HTTP Server | No | External middleware |\n| Inbound WebSocket Server | No | External middleware |\n| Raw TCP Sockets | No | Hybrid C++ plugin |\n| Localhost connections | Partial | Use IP, not hostname |\n\n---\n\n### Sources\n\n- [The Premiere UXP API](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [UXP WebSocket Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-js/Global%20Members/Data%20Transfers/WebSocket/)\n- [InDesign UXP Network Recipes](https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/resources/recipes/network/)\n- [UXP Photoshop Plugin Samples (GitHub)](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples)\n- [UXP Manifest v5 Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v5/)\n- [Adobe UXP Hybrid Plugins](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/)\n- [Forum: TCP Communication Discussion](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/communicate-with-other-apps-over-tcp-is-impossible/5908)\n- [Forum: WebSocket Issues](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-web-socket-under-http-2/5803)\n- [GitHub Issue: Localhost Permissions](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop/issues/321)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP Beta (Hyper Brew)](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1594,"cache_read_input_tokens":28326,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1594,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWJqAGMmWgP7G8yiUt3QN","type":"assistant","uuid":"f53ee197-bd39-4739-b0d2-4c5f0636125c","timestamp":"2025-12-20T23:47:37.855Z"}
