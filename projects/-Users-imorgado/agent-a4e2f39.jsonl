In contrast, the elements `start` and `end` specify the placement of a clipitem in a sequence.(no content)The elements `start` and `end` encode the start and end of a clipitem in an enclosing sequence. The element `duration` encodes the length of a clipitem. Note that the duration value for a clipitem may not match the duration value of the corresponding media, even when the clipitem and the media file are perfectly aligned. Applying speed to a clipitem, changing its framerate, or other edits can alter the duration of the clipitem.\n\n## Adobe-Specific Attributes\n\nWhen importing XML from other applications like DaVinci Resolve, Premiere Pro may require specific attributes. By adding the elements `MZ.Sequence.PreviewRenderingPresetPath=\"\"` and `MZ.Sequence.EditingModeGUID=\"609a9d56-729f-444b-bf64-52a282e6c9ab\"` to the 'sequence' node, Premiere Pro is able to import Resolve's XML files.\n\n## Important Notes\n\n- You can't open XML out of Premiere Pro directly in Final Cut Pro X, or vice versa. They, literally, do not speak the same language.\n\n- Premiere is using XML version 4, while some applications like Resolve want to read XML version 5.\n\nUnfortunately, the official Adobe XMEML specification is not publicly available.

For many years now Premiere Pro has imported, and exported, a variation of xmeml.\n\n### Known Import Issues\n\n1. **XMP Metadata Causing Crashes**: Render files get knocked loose in FCP due to Premiere Pro adding XMP metadata to the files, which changes them ever so slightly. A workaround is to import without writing the XMP data - in Premiere Pro, go to Preferences > Media and deselect \"Write XMP ID to Files on Import.\"\n\n2. **Generic Import Errors**: Users report \"File Import Failure – Error Message – The importer reported a generic error\" when trying to import some XML sequences.\n\n3. **Crashes with Complex Projects**: Projects crash when importing XML files that have graphics and such – even when rendered, while simpler projects with single clips work fine.\n\n4. **Positional Keyframe Data Issues**: Positional keyframe data does not seem to import from XML into Premiere Pro when importing modified XML back into a project. Scaling seems to work fine, but not positional keyframe data.\n\n5. **Aspect Ratio Issues**: When importing XML from FCP 7 to Premiere Pro, the aspect ratio of clips may not be carried over correctly, appearing as SD rather than HD, even with clips that were modified in motion.\n\n6. **In/Out Point Discrepancies**: When exporting XML from Premiere to FCP7, some sequences may have shots with different in and out points than the original, particularly related to timecode type (drop-frame vs. non-drop).\n\n### What Transfers Successfully\nIn Premiere Pro, bins and clips have the same hierarchies and names that they have in Final Cut Pro source projects. Premiere Pro retains the sequence markers, sequence settings, track layout, locked tracks, and sequence timecode start points. Premiere Pro also imports text from Final Cut Pro Text generators into Premiere Pro titles.(no content)Premiere Pro retains the basic motion and opacity effects, and motion and opacity keyframes, from Final Cut Pro source projects.\n\n### Troubleshooting Tips\n- Adobe has fixed causes of crashes when importing FCP XML in updates, so ensure you have the most recent updates installed.\n- Try stripping things out of the timeline to identify what's causing import failures - filters, freeze frames, and certain audio file types (like .caf) can cause issues.\n- Check the FCP Translation Results log file for conversion issues in the exact location.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"895d12ef-9677-4502-95d0-acf913aa7e20","timestamp":"2025-12-19T21:56:27.802Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro FCP 7 XML import known issues modified XMEML","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01QamqXJfB3Tw2yxifLgLWS1","content":[{"title":"xml import from FCP 7 general error or crash - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/xml-import-from-fcp-7-general-error-or-crash/"},{"title":"Demystifying Final Cut Pro XMLs","url":"https://fcp.cafe/developer-case-studies/fcpxml/"},{"title":"Support:kb406794 Error \"FCP XML Import Failed\" when you import clips into Premiere Pro CS4 | Adobe Premiere Pro | Fandom","url":"https://premierepro.fandom.com/wiki/Support:kb406794_Error_%22FCP_XML_Import_Failed%22_when_you_import_clips_into_Premiere_Pro_CS4"},{"title":"Solved: FCP XML Import/Export issue. - Adobe Product Community - 9025742","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/fcp-xml-import-export-issue/m-p/9025742"},{"title":"FCPX XML Import - Apple Final Cut Pro X - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/fcpx-xml-import/"},{"title":"FCP 7: Move Projects to Premiere Pro | Larry Jordan","url":"https://larryjordan.com/articles/fcp-7-move-projects-to-premiere-pro/comment-page-1/"},{"title":"Import XML files from Final Cut Pro 7 and Final Cut Pro X","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/importing-xml-project-files-final.html"},{"title":"xml issue Premiere to FCP7 - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/xml-issue-premiere-to-fcp7/"},{"title":"Export projects as Final Cut Pro XML in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere/desktop/render-and-export/export-files/export-a-project-as-a-final-cut-pro-xml-file.html"},{"title":"FCP xml import fail - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/fcp-xml-import-fail/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about Premiere Pro FCP 7 XML import known issues with modified XMEML:\n\n## Key Findings:\n\n### XMEML Format Details\nPremiere Pro works with a slightly modified XMEML based on the XML from FCP Classic version 6 — not the latest — that has Adobe-specific tags included.

So essentially every shot in the imported sequence is the same shot, (at varying lengths).(no content)Premiere Pro was incorrectly reading/showing/reporting the timecode values on all the source video clips. Checking those same clips in multiple other programs show an agreed upon timecode for each clip (checked in DaVinci Resolve, Final Cut Pro 7, Quicktime7 and Adobe After Effects) but Premiere shows a different value for the timecodes for all camera clips, rendering any form of EDL it exports effectively useless by any other program.\n\n### Metadata and Clip Instances\n\nDisplays properties for clip instances you select in the Project panel or Timeline panel. This metadata is stored in project files, so it appears only in Adobe Premiere Pro.(no content)Fields under the Clip heading show clip-instance metadata: information about a clip selected in the Project panel, or in a sequence. Clip instance metadata is stored in the Premiere Pro project file, not in the file to which the clip points. Only Premiere Pro reads clip instance metadata, not other applications.\n\n### Masterclip Effects\n\nMasterclip effect parameters cannot be edited from timeline clip instance.(no content)When it does, the solution seems to be to remove all masterclip effects and then apply the LUT to the timeline clips within Lumetri.\n\nIf you need more specific technical documentation about XML timing attributes for clips vs masterclips, I can perform additional searches focused on the FCP XML specification or Premiere Pro XML schema.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3c688a17-8f00-4c6a-83a0-49cbac2a645c","timestamp":"2025-12-19T21:56:52.804Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro XML clip vs masterclip timing attributes sync","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_014uwb5rufjefNYM26zNB4tQ","content":[{"title":"Relinking clips in timeline when xml import - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/relinking-clips-in-timeline-when-xml-import/"},{"title":"How clips work across projects in a Production","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/how-clips-work-inside-production.html"},{"title":"XML from Resolve to Premiere, all clips start at 0:00 - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/xml-from-resolve-to-premiere-all-clips-start-at-00/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Reads Incorrect Timecode from Source-Makes Bad XML - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/premiere-pro-reads-incorrect-timecode-from-source/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro XML imports files with timeline clip names - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/premiere-pro-xml-imports-files-with-timeline-clip-names/"},{"title":"How to insert clips on timeline according to timecode? - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/how-to-insert-clips-on-timeline-according-to-timec/"},{"title":"Transferring clips and metadata to Adobe Premiere Pro - Pomfort Knowledge Base Pomfort Knowledge Base","url":"https://kb.pomfort.com/silverstack/importandexport/transferring-clips-metadata-adobe-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Masterclip LUTs intermittently stop displaying - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/masterclip-luts-intermittently-stop-displaying/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro conform xml issues, with merged clips - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/premiere-pro-conform-xml-issues-with-merged-clips/"},{"title":"Managing metadata in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/metadata.html"}]},"Based on the search results, I found information about Premiere Pro XML, clips, and masterclips, though not a specific direct answer about timing attributes sync between clips and masterclips in XML.

Its subelements include: +name, +duration, +rate, +start, +end, link, syncoffset, enabled, in, out, masterclipid, subclipmasterid, ismasterclip, logginginfo, file, timecode, marker, anamorphic, alphatype, alphareverse, labels, comments, sourcetrack, compositemode, subclipinfo, filter, stillframe, stillframeoffset, sequence, multiclip, mediadelay, subframeoffset, mixedratesoffset, filmdata, pixelaspectratio, fielddominance, gamma, primarytimecode, and itemhistory.(no content)Note that start, end, link, syncoffset, and enabled are subelements of clipitem, but not of clip.\n\n### Rate Element Structure\n\nThe rate element typically contains:\n- `<ntsc>` - Boolean (TRUE/FALSE)\n- `<timebase>` - Frame rate value (e.g., 30, 24, 25)\n\n### Timecode Element Structure\n\nThe timecode element contains subelements including rate (with ntsc and timebase), string (timecode display like \"01:00:00;00\"), frame, source, and displayformat (DF for drop frame, NDF for non-drop frame).\n\n### Timecode Handling\n\nTo convert in and out to timecode values, use the starting timecode in the media, if there is one.

A clip element has three required subelements: name, duration, and rate.

To calculate or interpret the value for start and in, Final Cut numbers the first frame as frame 0.

Note that start, end, link, syncoffset, and enabled are subelements of clipitem, but not of clip.\n\n### Converting to Timecode\n\nTo convert start and end to timecode values, use the timecode in the containing sequence, or, for Browser clips, the timecode on the file of the containing clip.\n\n### XMEML vs FCPXML\n\nXMEML is a subset that Final Cut Pro 7 and below uses for creating a plain-text version of a Final Cut Pro project or sequence that other applications can read.

Now I have comprehensive information. Let me compile the research findings into a clear report.\n\n## XMEML (FCP 7 XML) Import Requirements for Premiere Pro - Research Report\n\nBased on my comprehensive research, here are the findings addressing your specific questions:\n\n### 1. REQUIRED ELEMENTS FOR PREMIERE PRO TO RECOGNIZE CLIP CHANGES\n\n**Critical findings:**\n\n- **Clip-level elements (required):** `name`, `duration`, and `rate`\n- **Clipitem-level elements in sequences:** `duration`, `in`, `out`, `start`, `end`, `rate`, and `timecode`\n\nKey distinction: Starting with **Premiere Pro CC 2019**, the XML import behavior changed significantly. Clipitems must be properly wrapped in a `<clip>` parent element with duration, in, and out values specified at the clip level, not just the sequence level.\n\n**Timing element specifications:**\n- `duration`: Integer specifying duration in frames\n- `in`: Starting point (source media reference, frame numbering starts at 0)\n- `out`: Ending point (source media reference, frame numbering starts at 1)\n- `start`: Relative starting position in track (for clipitem only)\n- `end`: Relative ending position in track (for clipitem only)\n- `rate`: Must include `<ntsc>` (TRUE/FALSE) and `<timebase>` (frame rate value)\n\n**Important frame numbering caveat:** Final Cut Pro uses two distinct numbering schemes:\n- For `start` and `in`: First frame = 0\n- For `out` and `end`: First frame = 1\n\n### 2. KNOWN ISSUES WITH IMPORTING MODIFIED XMEML FILES\n\n**Premiere Pro CC 2019 and later - Major Issue:**\n- Premiere ignores in/out points from modified XML when clips are wrapped in sequence->media->video->track->clipitem structure\n- Workaround: Wrap clipitems in a proper `<clip>` element with timing info at clip level\n\n**Other documented issues:**\n\n- **XMP metadata corruption**: Premiere Pro adds XMP metadata to files during import, causing render files to become mislinked. Workaround: Disable \"Write XMP ID to Files on Import\" in Preferences > Media\n\n- **Positional keyframe data loss**: Position keyframe data does not import from modified XML, though scale keyframes work fine\n\n- **Aspect ratio issues**: Clips may import as SD instead of HD, even when modified in motion\n\n- **Timecode drop-frame vs non-drop-frame**: In/out points may differ after export/re-import, particularly related to timecode type\n\n- **Complex project crashes**: Projects with graphics, filters, or certain audio types (.caf) crash on import\n\n- **Subclip handling inconsistency**: Subclips from FCP imports may not maintain expected relationships\n\n### 3. MASTERCLIP DURATION VS. CLIPITEM DURATION - WHICH IS USED?\n\n**Premiere Pro uses clipitem duration for timeline display, but the relationship is more nuanced:**\n\n**Master clips (browser-level):**\n- Represent the full duration of source media\n- Do NOT appear in sequences\n- Use `duration` element (total frames, doesn't change with in/out points)\n\n**Clipitems in sequences:**\n- Use their own `duration` element (represents duration in timeline, typically `out - in`)\n- Use `in` and `out` to reference which portion of source media is displayed\n- Use `start` and `end` for timeline positioning\n- Duration = `end - start` (approximately, should match `out - in` for unmodified clips)\n\n**Critical relationship:** For Premiere Pro to properly recognize a modified clipitem:\n- `duration` must equal `(out - in)` approximately\n- `duration` must equal `(end - start)` for correct timeline placement\n- These values must be synchronized - if duration doesn't match the other values, Premiere may recompute it\n\n### 4. \"PREMIERE PRO IGNORES XML CLIP DURATION\" - DOCUMENTATION FINDINGS\n\n**This is a well-documented issue:**\n\nFrom GitHub Issue #569 (AcademySoftwareFoundation/OpenTimelineIO):\n- Premiere CC 2019+ doesn't respect in/out points from XML-imported clips\n- Each clip imports with Video In = 00:00:00:00 and Video Out = full clip duration\n- The sequence shows correct cuts, but all shots reference the same starting point in source media\n\n**Root cause:** Premiere Pro 2019+ changed its XML import parsing to require a different structure than earlier versions.\n\n**Example problem:**\n```\nImported XML has:\n  in=\"320\" out=\"399\" duration=\"79\"\n  \nPremiere imports as:\n  in=\"0\" out=\"full_media_duration\"\n```\n\n**Solution from practitioners:**\n- Ensure proper XML structure with clip wrapper elements\n- Include Adobe-specific attributes: `MZ.Sequence.PreviewRenderingPresetPath=\"\"` and `MZ.Sequence.EditingModeGUID=\"609a9d56-729f-444b-bf64-52a282e6c9ab\"` in the sequence node\n- Validate XML against FCP 7 XML version 4 or 5 specification\n\n### 5. SPECIFIC ATTRIBUTES/ELEMENTS THAT MUST BE UPDATED TOGETHER\n\n**Synchronized required elements for clip duration changes:**\n\n1. **For masterclips being modified:**\n   - `<duration>` (total frames)\n   - `<rate>` block (ntsc + timebase)\n   - `<file>` element with matching duration\n\n2. **For clipitems in sequences being modified:**\n   - `<duration>` (must be: `out - in`, or `end - start`)\n   - `<in>` (starting frame in source)\n   - `<out>` (ending frame in source) \n   - `<start>` (position on timeline)\n   - `<end>` (position on timeline)\n   - `<rate>` block (must match sequence rate)\n   - `<timecode>` (if present, must be consistent with in/out values)\n\n3. **Critical: All three duration relationships must be consistent:**\n   ```\n   duration = (out - in) = (end - start)\n   ```\n\n4. **For Premiere Pro specifically:**\n   - Wrap clipitems in explicit `<clip>` parent element\n   - Maintain consistent `<rate>` with `<ntsc>` and `<timebase>` values\n   - Include proper timecode elements with rate information\n   - If using sequence-level clips, ensure all timing metadata is at both clip and clipitem levels\n\n**Additional synchronized updates:**\n- When changing `in`/`out`, recalculate `duration`\n- When changing frame rate (`timebase`), verify all frame-based values remain valid\n- When modifying sequences, ensure `start`/`end` values account for any duration changes\n- For modified XML with speed changes, keyframed speed graphs must have final `<when>` value equal to source duration\n\n### Summary of Best Practices for Modified XMEML Import to Premiere Pro\n\n1. Use FCP 7 XML version 5 format\n2. Ensure proper element nesting with `<clip>` wrappers around sequence clipitems\n3. Keep all duration-related elements synchronized (duration, in, out, start, end)\n4. Always validate frame rate consistency across all elements\n5. Include Adobe-specific attributes for Premiere Pro compatibility\n6. Test in Premiere Pro before using in production (versions vary in XML handling)\n7. Disable XMP metadata writing during import to prevent media relinking issues\n\nSources:\n- [Import XML files from Final Cut Pro 7 and Final Cut Pro X](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/importing-xml-project-files-final.html)\n- [FCP 7: Move Projects to Premiere Pro](https://larryjordan.com/articles/fcp-7-move-projects-to-premiere-pro/)\n- [Final Cut Pro 7 XML Interchange Format - Elements](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/FinalCutPro_XML/Elements/Elements.html)\n- [XMEML Topics](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/FinalCutPro_XML/Topics/Topics.html)\n- [Basics of Encoding - XMEML](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AppleApplications/Reference/FinalCutPro_XML/Basics/Basics.html)\n- [Premiere CC '19 - FCP XML Video In/Out points not working (GitHub Issue #569)](https://github.com/PixelAnimationStudios/OpenTimelineIO/issues/569)\n- [Demystifying Final Cut Pro XMLs](https://fcp.cafe/developer-case-studies/fcpxml/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":544,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2378,"cache_read_input_tokens":21907,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2378,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGo1N6K8rziZmGeje1sH","type":"assistant","uuid":"9e55e577-94c6-4af9-92ce-8f67887f4077","timestamp":"2025-12-19T21:57:53.538Z"}
