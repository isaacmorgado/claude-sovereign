The Sample SDK provides practical examples of how to interact with the Premiere API using UXP.\n\n3. **Development Tools**: UDT includes a Code Playground to quickly test and explore APIs, lets you package plugins into a .ccx installable file ready for distribution, and provides Starter Templates and Sample Projects to help you get moving faster.\n\n### Plugin Distribution\n\nIf your plugin is polished and ready for distribution, you can now submit it to the Adobe Marketplace for approval. Installed UXP plugins can be found in the new UXP Plugins submenu under 'Window'.\n\n### Legacy ExtendScript Support\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP. ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026."],"durationSeconds":29.44748133299999}}

Here's what I found:\n\n## Testing Strategies for Premiere Pro Plugins\n\n### Comprehensive Testing Approach\n\nTesting a suite of complex and diverse applications like Adobe's products involves a combination of methodologies tailored to each application's specific features, functionality, and use cases. A comprehensive testing strategy would include unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.\n\n### Integration Testing for Adobe Plugins\n\nTesting involves checking that the plugin communicates correctly with the Adobe host application and that all data is passed accurately. For applications that rely on Adobe's APIs or cloud services, testing should ensure that your application correctly integrates with these services, handles authentication, and processes data correctly.\n\n### End-to-End and Automated UI Testing\n\nEnd-to-end testing tests the complete application as a whole, checking the user workflow from start to finish. End-to-end testing ensures that the application works as expected during real-world use. Automated UI Testing tools like Selenium, Puppeteer, etc., can automate browser actions for web applications, including those that integrate with Adobe Creative Cloud services.\n\n### Performance Testing\n\nEnsure the applications perform well under expected and stress conditions. For example, in Adobe Premiere Pro, performance testing could involve importing and rendering a 4K video file.\n\n### ExtendScript for Testing and Automation\n\nIf you're someone who uses Adobe Premiere Pro or other Adobe products like After Effects, Illustrator, and Photoshop, you might find yourself performing repetitive tasks that could benefit from automation. Fortunately, most Adobe products offer a way to automate tasks with some basic scripting experience. The ExtendScript Developer Tools can help you automate these tasks and even create your own extensions. You can use the ExtendScript Developer Tools to automate tasks in Adobe Premiere Pro.(no content)By clicking on the run button, we can test our script.\n\n### The Test Pyramid Strategy (General Best Practice)\n\nThe test pyramid is a concept used in software development to describe the ideal distribution of different types of automated tests that make up a test suite. The idea was introduced by Mike Cohn. Unit Tests are at the base of the pyramid and are the most numerous. These tests are focused on checking the smallest parts of an application, such as individual functions or methods. Unit tests are quick to execute and help ensure that each component of the software works as expected in isolation.(no content)The pyramid aims to encourage developers to write a larger number of lower-level tests (unit tests) and fewer high-level tests (E2E tests). This distribution is recommended because lower-level tests tend to be faster, cheaper to automate, and more reliable, whereas higher-level tests are slower, more expensive, and can be flakier. By adhering to the test pyramid model, developers can ensure they have a balanced test suite that optimizes resources and maximizes the efficiency and effectiveness of the testing process.\n\n### Benchmark Testing for Premiere Pro\n\nThis method's benchmark results are highly consistent and accurately reflect the relative performance between two systems when working with different codecs. The raw FPS results do tend to be higher than what you will see during live playback or preview since it does not include all the additional steps required for Premiere Pro to show the video in the preview monitor.\n\nThe search results indicate that while there isn't extensive documentation specifically on unit testing Premiere Pro plugins, a combination of ExtendScript automation for testing scripts within Premiere Pro, along with standard unit testing frameworks for any supporting code (JavaScript/TypeScript), would form a solid testing strategy.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c077d4d6-d55a-4677-b4b8-af3e10240cbc","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:58:13.501Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro plugin testing strategies unit test automation","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_013SxFzzX5Wzw95K3qAN1vb9","content":[{"title":"Adobe Testing - testRigor AI-Based Automated Testing Tool","url":"https://testrigor.com/blog/adobe-testing/"},{"title":"An Introduction To Automated Testing Of WordPress Plugins With PHPUnit — Smashing Magazine","url":"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/12/automated-testing-wordpress-plugins-phpunit/"},{"title":"Testing Backend Plugins and Modules | Backstage Software Catalog and Developer Platform","url":"https://backstage.io/docs/backend-system/building-plugins-and-modules/testing/"},{"title":"Unit testing plugins","url":"https://developer.atlassian.com/server/confluence/unit-testing-plugins/"},{"title":"Testing","url":"https://www.jenkins.io/doc/developer/testing/"},{"title":"Tutorial: Premiere Pro Automation - Vakago Tools","url":"https://vakago-tools.com/tutorial-premiere-pro-automation/"},{"title":"Puget Bench for Premiere Pro | Puget Systems","url":"https://www.pugetsystems.com/pugetbench/creators/premiere-pro/"},{"title":"PluginTests.com","url":"https://plugintests.com/"},{"title":"Best Premiere Pro Plugins to Boost Your Workflow in 2026 | CYME","url":"https://cyme.io/en/blog/best-premiere-pro-plugins/"},{"title":"How to add automated unit tests to your WordPress plugin – WordPress Developer Blog","url":"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2025/12/how-to-add-automated-unit-tests-to-your-wordpress-plugin/"}]},"Based on my search, I found information about testing strategies for plugins, though specific Premiere Pro plugin testing resources are limited.

You can sequentially undo as many as 32 recent changes made to the project in any Premiere Pro panel.\n\n### Using the History Panel\n- The History panel in Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to track and manage your editing actions within the current project by providing a visual timeline of the actions you've taken.\n- You can access it by going to the \"Window\" menu, then choosing \"History\" from the dropdown. This panel shows you a list of all your recent actions, so you can step back through them, undoing each action till you reach your desired state.\n- From the panel dropdown menu, you can step forward or backward through saved actions, delete a step, clear the history, and most importantly, under settings, you can adjust the number of saved steps for undo and redo.\n\n### How the History Panel Works\n- To undo an action, select it in the History panel. All states and actions below are dimmed, and Premiere Pro reverts the project to the state just before the action occurred.\n- A state represents the overall condition or configuration of your project at a specific point in time. It encompasses all the actions that have been performed up to that point. Each time you perform a series of actions, Premiere Pro creates a new state in the history list to represent the project's state at that moment.\n\n### Important Guidelines\n- Program-wide changes, such as changes to panels, windows, and preferences, are not changes to the project itself and so are not added to the History panel. After you close and reopen the project, the previous states are no longer available in the History panel.\n- History states aren't available for actions within the Capture panel.\n\n### Reverting and Auto-Save Best Practices\n- To undo all changes made since the last time you saved the project, choose File > Revert.\n- Saving your project regularly is crucial to preventing significant progress or changes from being lost. Starting with creating backup copies of your project regularly via selecting File > Save As and choosing an alternative name or location for the backup file. In this way, you can resume where you left off if you unintentionally close the software without saving.\n- By enabling auto-save in Premiere Pro to save your project history at set intervals, you can relax knowing your work will be saved periodically, regardless of whether you remember to manually command save or not.\n\n### Recovering from Older States\n- To undo changes made before the last time you saved a project, try opening a previous version of your project in the Premiere Auto-Save folder, and then choose File > Save As to store the project in a location outside the Premiere Auto-Save folder.

You can sequentially undo as many as 32 recent changes made to the project in any Premiere Pro panel.\n\n### Using the History Panel\n- The History panel in Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to track and manage your editing actions within the current project by providing a visual timeline of the actions you've taken.\n- You can access it by going to the \"Window\" menu, then choosing \"History\" from the dropdown. This panel shows you a list of all your recent actions, so you can step back through them, undoing each action till you reach your desired state.\n- From the panel dropdown menu, you can step forward or backward through saved actions, delete a step, clear the history, and most importantly, under settings, you can adjust the number of saved steps for undo and redo.\n\n### How the History Panel Works\n- To undo an action, select it in the History panel. All states and actions below are dimmed, and Premiere Pro reverts the project to the state just before the action occurred.\n- A state represents the overall condition or configuration of your project at a specific point in time. It encompasses all the actions that have been performed up to that point. Each time you perform a series of actions, Premiere Pro creates a new state in the history list to represent the project's state at that moment.\n\n### Important Guidelines\n- Program-wide changes, such as changes to panels, windows, and preferences, are not changes to the project itself and so are not added to the History panel. After you close and reopen the project, the previous states are no longer available in the History panel.\n- History states aren't available for actions within the Capture panel.\n\n### Reverting and Auto-Save Best Practices\n- To undo all changes made since the last time you saved the project, choose File > Revert.\n- Saving your project regularly is crucial to preventing significant progress or changes from being lost. Starting with creating backup copies of your project regularly via selecting File > Save As and choosing an alternative name or location for the backup file.

You can automate workflows, build new features, and connect to other software and services—all with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.(no content)UXP is Adobe's latest extension platform, designed as a modern, lightweight, and secure solution for plug-in development. UXP leverages JavaScript with a React-like component system, allowing developers to create robust, responsive UI components without compromising performance.\n\n## Plugin Types and Architecture\n\nUXP supports several plugin types:\n- **Direct Actions** - headless plugins that interface with Photoshop, the host OS, and the network, free of any UI\n- **Modal Dialogs** - plugins that implement one or more modal dialogs, good for simple user interfaces that don't need to persist\n- **Panels** - full-featured panels that look like any other panel in Photoshop(no content)UXP panels can contain as complex a UI as you wish to develop. They can be resized, docked, opened and closed just like native Photoshop panels. And with appropriate CSS constructs, your UXP panels can be theme-aware and change as the user switches UI themes in Photoshop.\n\n## Best Practices and UX Patterns\n\nUX requirements highlight key patterns that all plugins need to follow in order to get approved by Adobe. Best practices provide recommendations on plugin usability and behavior, user feedback, privacy, and interface guidelines.(no content)User experience patterns highlight UX requirements and best practices, as well as provide guidance on how to interact with your plugin users within Adobe.(no content)The user interface section provides information on UXP Spectrum components you can use to build your plugin interface.\n\n## Development Resources and Samples\n\nAdobe provides working plugin examples for common tasks, best practices for plugin architecture, integration examples with APIs, and reusable code patterns you can adapt for your projects.(no content)Sample code includes JavaScript samples, React samples, and batch play samples.\n\n## Key Advantages of UXP Architecture\n\nUXP offers several architectural advantages:\n- **Performance Gains**: CEP extensions can slow down Adobe applications, while UXP's streamlined architecture provides a more efficient runtime\n- **Security Enhancements**: UXP's sandboxed approach reduces the risk of vulnerabilities\n- **Modern Development Practices**: UXP's compatibility with modern JavaScript features and React-based UI makes development faster\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBuilding your first UXP plugin requires two pieces of software, both of which can be installed via Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop - the latest version of Photoshop, and the UXP Developer Tool.(no content)The UXP Developer Tool is a GUI app that helps you create, debug, and distribute plugins.

If you want to release your plugin before UXP goes to stable then you might have a hard time as most users aren't running Beta.\n\n### Plugin Loading Issues\nYour built plugin directory should be placed within: ~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/UXP/Plugins/External. But wait! There are further requirements. The name of your plugin's containing folder must consist of specific elements including the three digit version number from the plugin's manifest.json.(no content)When placing the plug-in folder directly into ~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/UXP/Extensions/ and trying to launch it via Window > UXP Extensions in Premiere, the plug-in doesn't appear. In the UXP Extensions menu, users only see options like \"Browse Plug-ins\" and \"Manage Plug-ins,\" but not their manually placed plugin.\n\n### UXP Developer Tool Connection Problems\nDevelopers working on UXP plugins for Premiere Pro have run into critical environment issues where the UXP Developer Tool is unable to detect their stable installation of Premiere Pro 2025.(no content)When trying to load plugins (including official Adobe samples), it fails with the error message: \"Plugin Load Failed. No applications are connected to the service.\"(no content)This strongly suggests the root cause is a failure of a core Creative Cloud identity component, which prevents the entire UXP subsystem (including its preference menus) from initializing correctly.\n\n### Network Request Issues\nA recently reported issue involves being unable to make requests with HTTP URLs (vs. HTTPS) while the same request works with InDesign UXP. This affects Premiere Pro 25.6.3 on Mac.\n\n### Missing Features and API Gaps\nIt's highly recommended to start looking at all of the Premiere Pro APIs your current extensions use (e.g., importing footage, adding clips to the timeline, exporting, etc.) and test if those features exist and work as needed in UXP.(no content)Additionally, UXP has the unique ability of including a C++ Hybrid plugin aspect to run computationally heavy tasks, but note that UXP Hybrid plugins are not yet implemented in Premiere Pro.\n\n## Troubleshooting Steps\n\n1. **Verify Beta Installation**: Make sure you have the Premiere Pro BETA build available through Creative Cloud Desktop, along with the UXP Developer Tool.\n\n2. **Check Folder Naming**: Ensure your plugin folder follows the correct naming convention with the version number from manifest.json.\n\n3. **CEP Transition**: CEP extensions are 100% definitely still supported. The plan is to continue to support them for a calendar year beyond the release of UXP extensibility in non-beta PPro builds.\n\n4. **Use Sample Repos**: Reference sample repositories on how to achieve various tasks in the API to fill in the gaps of the documentation.\n\n5. **Community Resources**: Premiere Pro UXP has joined the new Adobe Developer forums, so post any bug reports or feature requests there for Adobe people to see.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"f36626d3-2ef4-4d84-bcc4-0f8bac43b9f1","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:58:54.775Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro UXP plugin common issues pitfalls troubleshooting","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0178rrWFZxPr9KzcJHxDbUCg","content":[{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"In Premiere Pro 25.6 Beta, my UXP plug-in does not... - Adobe Product Community - 15448001","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-beta-bugs/in-premiere-pro-25-6-beta-my-uxp-plug-in-does-not-load/idi-p/15448001"},{"title":"Premiere Pro 25.3 UXP Connection Failure - Adobe Product Community - 15371889","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-25-3-uxp-connection-failure/td-p/15371889"},{"title":"UXP Developer Tool Fails to Detect Premiere Pro 20... - Adobe Product Community - 15514472","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-developer-tool-fails-to-detect-premiere-pro-2025-quot-no-applications-are-connected-quot/td-p/15514472"},{"title":"Re: UXP Developer Tool Fails to Detect Premiere Pro 2025 - \"No applications are connected\"","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-developer-tool-fails-to-detect-premiere-pro-2025-quot-no-applications-are-connected-quot/m-p/15514761"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Extensions - To UXP or not to UXP - Adobe Product Community - 11326933","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-extensions-to-uxp-or-not-to-uxp/td-p/11326933"},{"title":"Solved: UXP Plugin Does Not Work - Adobe Product Community - 15263623","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-plugin-does-not-work/td-p/15263623"},{"title":"Premiere Pro 25.6.3 UXP Issue: Unable to Make Requ... - Adobe Product Community - 15622477","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-bugs/premiere-pro-25-6-3-uxp-issue-unable-to-make-requests-with-http-urls-vs-https/idi-p/15622477"},{"title":"Premiere Pro UXP Beta — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about common issues, pitfalls, and troubleshooting for Premiere Pro UXP plugins:\n\n## Key Issues and Pitfalls\n\n### Beta Status Limitations\n\"UXP in Premiere Pro is still in beta at this point, so there are lots of features / functions that that either don't exist or don't fully work as needed.\"(no content)As of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins.(no content)UXP is only available in Premiere Pro Beta, so only beta users will be able to use your panel if you start shipping a UXP Panel for Premiere Pro today.

This method is available on both the Sequence and Track objects:\n\n**Sequence-level syntax:**\n`app.project.sequences[index].insertClip(projectItem, time, vTrackIndex, aTrackIndex)`(no content)Returns a boolean; true if successful.\n\n**Track-level syntax:**\n`app.project.sequences[index].videoTracks[index].insertClip(projectItem, time, vTrackIndex, aTrackIndex)` adds a 'clip' (media segment from a ProjectItem object) to the track, at the specified time.(no content)Media will be inserted at that time.\n\n### overwriteClip() Method\n\n`app.project.sequences[index].overwriteClip(projectItem, time, vTrackIndex, aTrackIndex)` inserts a clip into the sequence, overwriting existing clips, on the specified video and audio tracks, at the specified time.(no content)At the track level, `overwriteClip(projectItem, time)` adds a clip to the track at the specified time. This will overwrite any existing media at that time.\n\n### TrackItem Object\n\nThe TrackItem object represents an item on a video or audio track, within a Sequence object. Access it via: `app.project.sequences[index].videoTracks[index].clips[index]`\n\n**Key TrackItem Properties:**\n- **duration**: The duration of the trackItem. Time object, read-only.\n- **end**: The visible end time of the trackItem in the sequence, relative to the beginning of its corresponding sequence. This may differ from the trackItem's out point, which is relative to the source. Time object, read/write.\n- **inPoint**: The in point set on the source for this trackItem instance, relative to the beginning of the source. Time object, read/write.\n- **start**: The visible start time of the trackItem in the sequence, relative to the beginning of its corresponding sequence. This may differ from the trackItem's in point, which is relative to the source. Time object, read/write.\n- **components**: The components associated with this trackItem. This can include intrinsic transformations, as well as video and audio effects.\n\n**TrackItem Methods:**\n- `getSpeed()` returns the speed multiplier applied to the TrackItem as a Float. No speed adjustment = 1.\n- `isSpeedReversed()` returns whether the trackItem is reversed. Returns 1 if TrackItem is reversed; 0 if not.\n- `isSelected()` retrieves the current selection state of the trackItem.\n\n### Important Notes and Quirks\n\nIt doesn't seem to matter whether you choose the target sequence's videoTracks or audioTracks. Executing insertClip/overwriteClip always carries all picture and sound tracks from source clip to sequence. The timeline track activators play no role.(no content)However, it does matter which track layer is chosen. Choosing videoTracks[0] or audioTracks[0] means a source clip with 1 picture track and 2 sound tracks will route to V1 and A1/A2 on the record side. Choosing videoTracks[1]/audioTracks[1] means Source V1/A1/A2 will route to Sequence V2/A2/A3.(no content)The insertClip function was implemented with v2017.1 and is not available in previous versions.\n\n### Working with Subclips\n\nYou can use `app.project.rootItem.children[index].createSubClip(name, startTime, endTime, hasHardBoundaries, takeAudio, takeVideo)` and then insert this clipped project item to sequence track with `app.project.sequences[index].videoTracks[index].insertClip(projectItem, time)`.\n\n### Getting TrackItem Reference After Insert\n\nIf you need to manipulate the components of trackItem instances that you create, you need to discover the trackItem reference.

Use the `endUndoGroup()` method to mark the end of the group.(no content)`beginUndoGroup()` and `endUndoGroup()` pairs can be nested. Groups within groups become part of the larger group, and will undo correctly. In this case, the names of inner groups are ignored.\n\n### UXP Development (Newer API)\n\nUnlike ExtendScript, Premiere Pro Beta & UXP leave history of operations in 'History'. This allows users to 'Undo'. This is good!(no content)In UXP panels, when dragging a scale value, Premiere shows the preview, and once you release the mouse button, a single undo step (history entry) is created. When not properly implemented, a new undo step is created for each value the slider has while dragging. This was implemented by calling `project.executeTransaction` on every slider value change.\n\n### Workarounds Mentioned\n\nSome developers have mentioned using the undocumented QE DOM with functions like `qe.project.undo()` and `qe.project.undoStackIndex()`, but these are unsupported functions and developers have to guess how they work.\n\nIn summary, if you need undo group functionality in Premiere Pro, the ExtendScript API does not support it.

It is worth noting that they are, in the background, asynchronous in nature.\n\n### Handling Async Code in UXP\n\nUXP scripts expect your code to be synchronous. To make it work, we need to make the thread wait for the async task to finish before continuing with the next statement. We can attain this by using Promise and await.\n\n### How Await Works\n\nAwait expressions cause async function execution to pause until a Promise is either fulfilled or rejected, and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillment. When resumed, the value of the await expression is that of the fulfilled Promise.(no content)Global await means awaiting for a global scope async function to finish.\n\n### Best Practices and Caveats\n\nUsing `await` means \"let's wait for the duplication to be completed so for the promise to be resolved and then assign to dup the result.\" However, if you try to use await, you'll get \"uncaught syntax error await is only valid in async function\" - so you need to specify that the function containing this await is asynchronous by adding the `async` keyword to the function.(no content)A key caveat is that `map` and `forEach` (array functions) with async and await can lead to problems, so try to use for loops as much as possible in these cases.(no content)You have to be aware that, opposed to ExtendScript, in UXP you have a number of functions that return promises so either you use then callbacks or you use async/await.\n\n### API Versioning Considerations\n\nPremiere version (v25.6) determines which Premiere DOM APIs are available. UXP version (v8.1) determines which UXP Core APIs are available. Each Premiere release integrates a specific UXP version. For example, Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.(no content)If your plugin relies on an API introduced in UXP v8.2, but the user is running Premiere v25.6 (which only includes UXP v8.1), it will throw errors and fail to run.

It is worth noting that they are, in the background, asynchronous in nature.\n\n### Handling Async Code in UXP\n\nUXP scripts expect your code to be synchronous. To make it work, we need to make the thread wait for the async task to finish before continuing with the next statement. We can attain this by using Promise and await.\n\n### How Await Works\n\nAwait expressions cause async function execution to pause until a Promise is either fulfilled or rejected, and to resume execution of the async function after fulfillment. When resumed, the value of the await expression is that of the fulfilled Promise.(no content)Global await means awaiting for a global scope async function to finish.\n\n### Best Practices and Caveats\n\nUsing `await` means \"let's wait for the duplication to be completed so for the promise to be resolved and then assign to dup the result.\" However, if you try to use await, you'll get \"uncaught syntax error await is only valid in async function\" - so you need to specify that the function containing this await is asynchronous by adding the `async` keyword to the function.(no content)A key caveat is that `map` and `forEach` (array functions) with async and await can lead to problems, so try to use for loops as much as possible in these cases.(no content)You have to be aware that, opposed to ExtendScript, in UXP you have a number of functions that return promises so either you use then callbacks or you use async/await.\n\n### API Versioning Considerations\n\nPremiere version (v25.6) determines which Premiere DOM APIs are available. UXP version (v8.1) determines which UXP Core APIs are available. Each Premiere release integrates a specific UXP version. For example, Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.(no content)If your plugin relies on an API introduced in UXP v8.2, but the user is running Premiere v25.6 (which only includes UXP v8.1), it will throw errors and fail to run. The same applies if your plugin depends on APIs added in Premiere v25.7 but the user is still on v25.6. To avoid compatibility issues, make sure to target APIs common to both versions, or implement fallback logic for older releases when possible.\n\n### Current Status\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026."],"durationSeconds":28.389798165999995}}

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.\n\n## executeTransaction and CompoundAction\n\nThe `executeTransaction` method has the signature: `executeTransaction(callback: (compoundAction: CompoundAction) => void, undoString?: string): boolean` - it executes an undoable transaction by passing a compound action.(no content)There's also a `lockedAccess(callback: () => void)` method that provides read/upgrade locked access to the Project. The project state will not change during the execution of the callback function, and you can call `executeTransaction` while having locked access.\n\n## Undo History Behavior\n\nUnlike ExtendScript, Premiere Pro Beta & UXP leave history of operations in 'History'. This allows users to 'Undo'. This is good!(no content)UXP plugins can make Undo groupings, instead of introducing a new Undo item with each API call.\n\n## Common Use Case Challenge\n\nA common challenge developers face is when dragging slider values - a new undo step is created for each value change when calling `project.executeTransaction` on every slider value change, rather than creating a single undo step when the mouse button is released.\n\n## Code Example\n\nHere's a practical example showing how to use `lockedAccess` and `executeTransaction` together:\n\n```javascript\nproject.lockedAccess(() => {\n    project.executeTransaction((compoundAction) => {\n        actInsertProjItem = seqEditor.createInsertProjectItemAction(\n            itemToInsert, \n            insertionTime, \n            0, \n            0, \n            onlyShiftInputTrack\n        );\n        compoundAction.addAction(actInsertProjItem);\n    });\n});\n```\n\nUsing `lockedAccess` and `executeTransaction` together is essential for proper action execution in UXP.\n\n## Key Differences from ExtendScript\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous and blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread.\n\n## Resources\n\n- The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/\n- Sample plugins and development instructions are available on GitHub, though as of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b9d5e36b-3a04-470e-b87d-f2f57d609021","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:01:23.314Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro UXP executeTransaction compoundAction undo history","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0132mhXzw8fmM7rdgoPDuyhf","content":[{"title":"uxp-premiere-pro/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts"},{"title":"How to group a longer user interaction into a single undo step? - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/how-to-group-a-longer-user-interaction-into-a-single-undo-step/10375"},{"title":"PPro Beta & UXP operation history - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/ppro-beta-uxp-operation-history/9022"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Premiere and UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/"},{"title":"Silent Failure: executeTransaction with createSetInPoint/OutPointAction shows success but no changes applied in Premiere Pro 25.3 Beta - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/silent-failure-executetransaction-with-createsetinpoint-outpointaction-shows-success-but-no-changes-applied-in-premiere-pro-25-3-beta/10765"},{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"Solved: UXP: Everything I need to know? - Adobe Product Community - 15476462","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-everything-i-need-to-know/m-p/15476462"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"Solved: Help with the new UXP createInsertProjectItemActio... - Adobe Product Community - 15239302","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/help-with-the-new-uxp-createinsertprojectitemaction-method-quot-script-action-failed-to-execute-quot/m-p/15239302"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about Premiere Pro UXP's `executeTransaction`, `compoundAction`, and undo history:\n\n## Overview\n\nUXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications.

You will also need the latest build, v2.2.1, of the UXP Developer Tools (UDT) to load, debug, and package your plugins. You can download the UDT through Creative Cloud Desktop.\n\n### Debugging Features\n\nIn this debugger (which resembles the Chrome Developer tool) you can look at the console log, and do the usual debugger things such as setting breakpoints, stepping into and out of functions, walking through code, inspecting elements, and more.(no content)You may also instruct to \"break on start\" when debugging your plugins. The plugin will immediately break into the debugger when it is loaded so that you can trace through the plugin's initialization routines. Select More from the Actions menu and check on 'Break on start'.\n\n### Console Logging\n\nFor Premiere Pro v25.2 or higher with UDT v2.1.0 or higher, you can use `console.log(\"foo\")` which writes \"foo\" to the UXP Developer Tool console. You can also use `console.error(\"foo error\")` which does the same thing, but the text is shown in red so errors are more easily seen.(no content)While writing complex logic, you might be in the cycle of testing/debugging your code. Although UDT -> Debug lets you set breakpoints and debug your code using Chrome Debug Tool, these couple of techniques may also prove handy.\n\n### UDT Interface\n\nClick the gear icon to open the preferences panel and update the UDT Theme (Dark or Light), toggle Auto Scroll Logs, or change the Service Port that UDT uses to communicate with host applications. Click the document icon 📄 in the top-left corner to open the Logs panel.\n\n### Developer Mode Setup\n\nWhen you launch the Developer Tool for the first time, you'll be prompted to enable Developer Mode.

You will also need the latest build, v2.2.1, of the UXP Developer Tools (UDT) to load, debug, and package your plugins. You can download the UDT through Creative Cloud Desktop.\n\n### Debugging Features\n\nIn this debugger (which resembles the Chrome Developer tool) you can look at the console log, and do the usual debugger things such as setting breakpoints, stepping into and out of functions, walking through code, inspecting elements, and more.(no content)You may also instruct to \"break on start\" when debugging your plugins. The plugin will immediately break into the debugger when it is loaded so that you can trace through the plugin's initialization routines. Select More from the Actions menu and check on 'Break on start'.\n\n### Console Logging\n\nFor Premiere Pro v25.2 or higher with UDT v2.1.0 or higher, you can use `console.log(\"foo\")` which writes \"foo\" to the UXP Developer Tool console. You can also use `console.error(\"foo error\")` which does the same thing, but the text is shown in red so errors are more easily seen.(no content)While writing complex logic, you might be in the cycle of testing/debugging your code. Although UDT -> Debug lets you set breakpoints and debug your code using Chrome Debug Tool, these couple of techniques may also prove handy.\n\n### UDT Interface\n\nClick the gear icon to open the preferences panel and update the UDT Theme (Dark or Light), toggle Auto Scroll Logs, or change the Service Port that UDT uses to communicate with host applications. Click the document icon 📄 in the top-left corner to open the Logs panel.\n\n### Developer Mode Setup\n\nWhen you launch the Developer Tool for the first time, you'll be prompted to enable Developer Mode. This is required for you to load plugins in development into the application. Once you click Enable, elevated permissions will be requested, and you may be required to enter your password or approve an action from the Developer Tool.(no content)The UXP Developer Tool requires administrator-level privileges to run correctly.\n\n### Additional Resources\n\nAdobe has updated their sample code to help developers hit the ground running. The Sample SDK provides practical examples of how to interact with the Premiere API using UXP.(no content)The documentation helps you learn the essentials, set up your development environment, and understand the technical stack, with step-by-step tutorials for creating panels, commands, and modal dialogs."],"durationSeconds":25.11646170799999}}

Existing UXP Plugins and Examples to Learn From\n\n### Official Adobe Samples\n- **[AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)** - The primary official sample repository\n  - Contains the `premiere-api` sample demonstrating fundamental UXP plugin development\n  - Built with TypeScript (72.2%), JavaScript (16.9%), HTML (10.2%)\n  - Includes TypeScript definitions (`types.d.ts`) for IDE autocomplete\n\n### Third-Party Tools and Frameworks\n- **[Bolt UXP by Hyper Brew](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp)** - Lightning-fast boilerplate for building Adobe UXP Plugins\n  - Supports Svelte, React, or Vue with Vite + TypeScript + Sass\n  - Hot Module Replacement (HMR) for rapid development\n  - Used by teams at Google, Battle Axe, and Adobe\n\n### Commercial Plugins for Reference Patterns\n- **[Excalibur](https://knightsoftheeditingtable.com/excalibur)** - Keyboard automation plugin demonstrating complex action combinations\n- **[BeatEdit](https://aescripts.com/forums/discussion/2002/beatedit-2-for-premiere-pro)** - Beat detection and marker creation, demonstrating timeline marker manipulation\n\n---\n\n## 2. Adobe's Official Documentation Resources\n\n### Primary Documentation\n- **[Premiere Pro UXP API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)** - Main developer portal\n- **[Premiere API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)** - Complete API reference\n- **[Getting Started Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/getting-started/)** - Initial setup tutorial\n- **[Starters and Samples](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/starters-samples/)** - Official starter templates\n\n### Legacy ExtendScript Reference (Still Relevant)\n- **[Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)** - Community-maintained ExtendScript documentation\n- **[PProPanel Sample](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel)** - Comprehensive ExtendScript API examples\n\n### UXP Type Definitions\n- **[types.d.ts](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)** - TypeScript definitions for all Premiere UXP APIs\n\n---\n\n## 3. Common Pitfalls for Editing/Razor Functionality\n\n### Critical Limitation: No Direct Split/Razor API\nThere is **no split or razor method** in either the official ExtendScript API or UXP API. The workaround approach is:\n\n1. Truncate the original `trackItem` (change its end point to the cut position)\n2. Insert a new `trackItem` based on the same `projectItem` starting at the cut position\n\n### QE DOM Razor Method (Undocumented, Unsupported)\n```javascript\napp.enableQE();\nqe.project.getActiveSequence().getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(timecode);\nqe.project.getActiveSequence().getAudioTrackAt(0).razor(timecode);\n```\n**Warning**: This unlinks audio/video tracks and requires re-linking with `sequence.linkSelection()`.\n\n### Other Pitfalls\n- **No vertical clip movement API** - Cannot move clips between tracks programmatically\n- **No timeline view control** - Cannot control zoom or scroll position\n- **TrackItem reference retrieval** - After `insertClip()`, you must iterate through all trackItems to find the newly created one by matching the `start` property\n- **Time conversion complexity** - 254,016,000,000 ticks per second; use `Time()` objects for conversion\n- **Plugin loading issues** - Folder naming must include the three-digit version number from `manifest.json`\n\n---\n\n## 4. Undo/Redo for Editing Operations\n\n### UXP Approach: executeTransaction + CompoundAction\n```javascript\nproject.lockedAccess(() => {\n    project.executeTransaction((compoundAction) => {\n        const action = seqEditor.createInsertProjectItemAction(\n            itemToInsert, \n            insertionTime, \n            0, \n            0, \n            onlyShiftInputTrack\n        );\n        compoundAction.addAction(action);\n    }, \"Insert Clip\"); // Optional undo string\n});\n```\n\n**Key Methods from TypeScript definitions**:\n- `executeTransaction(callback: (compoundAction: CompoundAction) => void, undoString?: string): boolean`\n- `compoundAction.addAction(action: Action): boolean`\n- `lockedAccess(callback: () => void)` - Provides locked access preventing state changes during execution\n\n### Avoiding Multiple Undo Steps\nWhen implementing slider interactions, call `executeTransaction` only on mouse release, not on every value change. Otherwise, each intermediate value creates a separate undo step.\n\n### ExtendScript Limitation\n**Undo groups are NOT possible** through Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API (unlike After Effects which has `beginUndoGroup()`/`endUndoGroup()`). The functionality exists internally but is not exposed to developers.\n\n---\n\n## 5. Performance Considerations for Timeline Manipulation\n\n### UXP vs CEP Architecture\n| Aspect | CEP | UXP |\n|--------|-----|-----|\n| Stack | Node.js + Chromium (heavy) | Adobe proprietary (lightweight) |\n| Environment | Dual (JS frontend + ExtendScript backend) | Unified single environment |\n| API calls | Synchronous (blocks UI) | Asynchronous (non-blocking) |\n| C++ access | Not available | Hybrid plugins (future in Premiere) |\n\n### Key Performance Patterns\n\n1. **Asynchronous Operations**: UXP method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread. All properties (get/set) were designed to be synchronous for smooth transition from ExtendScript.\n\n2. **Use `lockedAccess` for Batch Operations**: Prevents project state changes during callback execution, ensuring consistency.\n\n3. **Avoid Array Methods with Async**: `map()` and `forEach()` with async/await can cause issues; use `for` loops instead.\n\n4. **Disable Unused Tracks**: Hidden video tracks still consume resources. Disable tracks that are not in use.\n\n5. **Proxy Workflows**: Use proxy workflows when working with large frame sizes.\n\n6. **Cache Management**: Use SSD storage for cache files (500GB dedicated SSD recommended).\n\n### API Versioning\n- Premiere version determines Premiere DOM APIs available\n- UXP version determines UXP Core APIs available\n- Example: Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1\n- Implement fallback logic for older releases when possible\n\n---\n\n## 6. Testing Strategies for Premiere Pro Plugins\n\n### Testing Pyramid Approach\n1. **Unit Tests** (Most numerous) - Test individual functions/methods in isolation\n2. **Integration Tests** - Verify plugin communicates correctly with Premiere Pro host\n3. **End-to-End Tests** (Fewest) - Test complete user workflows\n\n### UXP Debugging Tools\n- **[UXP Developer Tool (UDT)](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/)** - Required for development\n  - Chrome-like debugger with console log, breakpoints, stepping\n  - `console.log(\"message\")` writes to UDT console\n  - `console.error(\"error\")` displays in red\n  - \"Break on start\" option for initialization debugging\n\n### Manual Testing Approach\nSince no formal test framework exists for Premiere Pro plugins:\n1. Use ExtendScript Developer Tools to test scripts directly\n2. Test API availability for each Premiere Pro API used (importing, adding clips, exporting)\n3. Performance testing with 4K video files under expected and stress conditions\n4. Test undo/redo behavior after all editing operations\n\n### Benchmark Testing\n[Puget Bench for Premiere Pro](https://www.pugetsystems.com/pugetbench/creators/premiere-pro/) provides standardized performance benchmarking methodologies.\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Key Development Resources\n\n| Resource | URL |\n|----------|-----|\n| Official UXP Documentation | https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ |\n| UXP Samples Repository | https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples |\n| Bolt UXP Boilerplate | https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp |\n| ExtendScript Guide | https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/ |\n| Debugging Guide | https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/recipes/debug/ |\n| Hyper Brew UXP Beta Guide | https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/ |\n\n**Current Status (December 2025)**: UXP is now officially available in Premiere Pro 25.6 (no longer beta-only).
