The currently-active project is obtained through this object.\n\n### Project Class\n\nThe Project class includes static methods such as `createProject` to create a new project, and `getActiveProject` to get the currently active project.\n\n### XML Export Methods (ExtendScript API - still supported)\n\n`app.project.exportFinalCutProXML(outputPath, suppressUI)` exports an FCP XML representation of the entire project to the specified output path and returns 0 if successful.(no content)`app.project.exportAAF()` exports an AAF file of the specified Sequence object using the specified settings and returns 0 if successful.(no content)`app.project.exportOMF(sequence, outputPath, omfTitle, sampleRate, bitsPerSample, audioEncapsulated, audioFileFormat, trimAudioFiles, handleFrames, includePan)` exports an OMF file of the specified Sequence object using the specified settings.\n\n### Sequence-Related Methods\n\nYou can attach a custom property and its value to a sequence using `app.project.sequences[index]` methods. This property is visible if/when the sequence is exported to FCP XML and returns a boolean; true if successful.(no content)`app.project.sequences[index].autoReframeSequence(numerator, denominator, motionPreset, newName, useNestedSequences)` generates a new, auto-reframed Sequence object.\n\n### Development Resources\n\nThe Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.(no content)For developing UXP plugins within Premiere Pro, as of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds supported UXP plugins.(no content)Premiere version (v25.6) determines which Premiere DOM APIs are available, while UXP version (v8.1) determines which UXP Core APIs are available.

As of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins.(no content)The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n\n### Requirements\n- You'll need a Premiere Pro BETA build, available through Creative Cloud Desktop, and the UXP Developer Tool, also available for download through Creative Cloud Desktop.\n\n### Setup Instructions\nTo get started, use the Adobe third-party sample panel from the premiere-api directory. Open your console/terminal into sample-panels/premiere-api/html, and the plugin will be built in the /build-html directory.(no content)Launch Premiere Pro Beta, load UDT (UXP Developer Tool), click Add Plugin, and navigate to the premiere-api/build-html/manifest.json and click Open.\n\n## Export/Import API Functions\n\nFrom the TypeScript definitions file, the UXP API includes these export-related functions:\n\nThe API includes `createImportTextSegmentsAction` to import external transcripts to ClipProjectItem, and `exportToJSON` to export transcripts inside of clipProjectItem as a JSON string if a transcript exists.(no content)If no output file and preset is specified, the sequence will be exported with the applied export settings or standard export rules will be applied.

As of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins.(no content)The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n\n### Requirements\n- You'll need a Premiere Pro BETA build, available through Creative Cloud Desktop, and the UXP Developer Tool, also available for download through Creative Cloud Desktop.\n\n### Setup Instructions\nTo get started, use the Adobe third-party sample panel from the premiere-api directory. Open your console/terminal into sample-panels/premiere-api/html, and the plugin will be built in the /build-html directory.(no content)Launch Premiere Pro Beta, load UDT (UXP Developer Tool), click Add Plugin, and navigate to the premiere-api/build-html/manifest.json and click Open.\n\n## Export/Import API Functions\n\nFrom the TypeScript definitions file, the UXP API includes these export-related functions:\n\nThe API includes `createImportTextSegmentsAction` to import external transcripts to ClipProjectItem, and `exportToJSON` to export transcripts inside of clipProjectItem as a JSON string if a transcript exists.(no content)If no output file and preset is specified, the sequence will be exported with the applied export settings or standard export rules will be applied. The `encodeProjectItem` function can encode input clipProjectItem in AME (Adobe Media Encoder).(no content)The API provides `getExportFileExtension` to get the export file extension of an input preset file, along with constants like EXPORT_QUEUE_TO_AME, EXPORT_QUEUE_TO_APP, and EXPORT_IMMEDIATELY for different export types.\n\n## Related: CEP Samples (Legacy)\n\nAs of Premiere Pro 25.6, CEP extensions to Premiere Pro have been superseded by UXP Extensibility.

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.\n\n### Accessing the File System\n\nTo use the file system API, you need to require it like this:\n```javascript\nconst fs = require(\"uxp\").storage.localFileSystem;\n```\n\n### Key Methods\n\nYou can use the fs object to access folders and files:\n- `fs.getTemporaryFolder()` - access a temporary folder (no user interaction required)\n- `fs.getPluginFolder()` - read-only access to the plugin's install folder\n- `fs.getDataFolder()` - folder to store settings\n- `fs.getFolder()` - displays a folder picker UI\n- `fs.getFileForOpening()` - \"Open\" file picker, suitable for reading contents\n- `fs.getFileForSaving(\"hello.txt\")` - \"Save\" file picker, suitable for writing contents\n\n### `getFileForSaving` Method\n\nThe `getFileForSaving` method gets a file reference suitable for read-write. It displays a file picker to select a location to \"Save\" the file.(no content)When using `getFileForSaving`, it displays a file picker to select a location to \"Save\" the file. If the act of writing to the file would overwrite it, the file picker will prompt the user to confirm before returning a result.(no content)File entries returned by `getFileForOpening` are read-only - use `getFileForSaving` to get a File entry you can write to.\n\n### Accessing Files from a Known Path\n\nA common question developers have is whether there's a way to get a file or folder from a known local path.

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.\n\n### Accessing the File System\n\nTo use the file system API, you need to require it like this:\n```javascript\nconst fs = require(\"uxp\").storage.localFileSystem;\n```\n\n### Key Methods\n\nYou can use the fs object to access folders and files:\n- `fs.getTemporaryFolder()` - access a temporary folder (no user interaction required)\n- `fs.getPluginFolder()` - read-only access to the plugin's install folder\n- `fs.getDataFolder()` - folder to store settings\n- `fs.getFolder()` - displays a folder picker UI\n- `fs.getFileForOpening()` - \"Open\" file picker, suitable for reading contents\n- `fs.getFileForSaving(\"hello.txt\")` - \"Save\" file picker, suitable for writing contents\n\n### `getFileForSaving` Method\n\nThe `getFileForSaving` method gets a file reference suitable for read-write. It displays a file picker to select a location to \"Save\" the file.(no content)When using `getFileForSaving`, it displays a file picker to select a location to \"Save\" the file. If the act of writing to the file would overwrite it, the file picker will prompt the user to confirm before returning a result.(no content)File entries returned by `getFileForOpening` are read-only - use `getFileForSaving` to get a File entry you can write to.\n\n### Accessing Files from a Known Path\n\nA common question developers have is whether there's a way to get a file or folder from a known local path. The standard methods like `localFileSystem.getFolder()` or `localFileSystem.getFileForOpening()` open the file picker dialog, which may not be desired when the path is already known.(no content)According to the documentation, a native \"file:\" scheme for the path parameter can be used to access and read files, but users have reported issues like \"Route not found\" errors when trying to use paths directly.\n\n### Permissions Required\n\nPermission-based APIs need to be allow-listed in your plugin's manifest.json.

This returns a string with the actual file system path.\n\n### Key Concepts\n\nInstead of working with string paths, you work with File and Folder objects. Access to the user's files requires showing a file picker UI, but you can access temporary files and any files packaged inside your plugin without needing any user interaction. If you have a File/Folder object, then you have access to the corresponding item on disk.\n\n### Two File System Access Options\nYou have two options to access the file system - LocalFileSytem and FS module. These modules are very similar in terms of the capabilities they offer, however, there is a difference in the way they carry out the task. LocalFileSytem APIs work with an object reference called Entry. Having an object reference makes it easier to manage and perform multiple operations. Whereas the FS APIs are very similar to NodeJS path-based file system APIs which make them ideal for carrying out single operations.\n\n### File Access Permissions\nUXP does not allow arbitrary access to the local filesystem; for any file outside of your plugin's home folder, data folder, or temp folder, you must ask the user for access by presenting a (built into UXP) dialog.\n\n### Available Folders\nThe localFileSystem provides access to: a temporary folder (contents removed when the extension is disposed), a folder for extension's data storage without user interaction (persistent across host-app version upgrades), and a plugin's folder which is read-only and contains all Plugin related packaged assets.\n\n### Tokens for File References\n- **Session Tokens**: Session tokens are valid only for the current plugin session. As such, it is of no use if you serialize the token to persistent storage, as the token will be invalid in the future.\n\n- **Persistent Tokens**: A persistent token is not guaranteed to last forever -- certain scenarios can cause the token to no longer work (including moving files, changing permissions, or OS-specific limitations). If a persistent token cannot be reused, you'll get an error at the time of use.\n\n### Creating Files with URLs\nYou'll never instantiate a File directly; instead you'll get access via a storage.FileSystemProvider. Keep in mind that File as such doesn't need a require() statement, however a localFileSystem will need it. For example: `const file = await fs.createEntryWithUrl(\"file:/Users/user/Documents/tmp\")`\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4196dd2f-6245-4199-b5b9-7ff2ffc8bd2e","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:54:11.837Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"site:developer.adobe.com UXP storage localFileSystem file path","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_019JRPPBHdcotg6WZbn8GtD1","content":[{"title":"require('uxp').storage.localFileSystem","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/reference/uxp-api/reference-js/Modules/uxp/Persistent%20File%20Storage/FileSystemProvider/"},{"title":"require('uxp').storage.FileSystemProvider","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/uxp/reference-js/Modules/uxp/Persistent%20File%20Storage/FileSystemProvider/"},{"title":"File operations","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/resources/recipes/file-operation/"},{"title":"Adobe","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-js/Modules/uxp/Persistent%20File%20Storage/Folder/"},{"title":"Using the File API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/reference/uxp/storage-index/"},{"title":"File","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-js/Modules/uxp/Persistent%20File%20Storage/File/"},{"title":"Document","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2021/ps_reference/classes/document/"},{"title":"require('uxp').uxp.storage.localFileSystem","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/uxp/reference-js/Modules/uxp/Persistent%20File%20Storage/localFileSystem/"},{"title":"Guides - Photoshop UXP Plugins","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2021/guides/ps_basics/"},{"title":"File Access in UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/file-access/"}]},"Based on the search results from developer.adobe.com, here's what I found about UXP storage localFileSystem and file paths:\n\n## UXP Storage LocalFileSystem - File Path Information\n\n### Accessing the localFileSystem\nYou can start using the file system APIs by obtaining a FileSystemProvider object: `const fs = require(\"uxp\").storage.localFileSystem`\n\n### Getting Platform Native File Path\nThe `localFileSystem` provides a method that returns the platform native file system path of a given entry.

There's no control of the timeline view, and Premiere Pro scripting was initially created for automation without a user.\n\n### XML Export in ExtendScript (Legacy API)\n\nThe ExtendScript API does include XML export functionality. The legacy API can export an FCP XML representation of the entire project to the specified output path, returning 0 if successful.\n\n### Workarounds\n\n1. **Use ExtendScript for Now**: ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026. You can continue using ExtendScript for XML export functionality until the UXP API is more complete.\n\n2. **Hybrid Approach**: With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment. The previous CEP technology communicated between the extension logic and the host application through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between two runtimes. Consider using a hybrid approach if needed.\n\n3. **Version Compatibility**: If your plugin relies on an API introduced in a newer UXP version but the user is running an older Premiere version, it will throw errors and fail to run. To avoid compatibility issues, make sure to target APIs common to both versions, or implement fallback logic for older releases when possible.\n\n### Key Differences Between ExtendScript and UXP\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\nIf XML export is critical for your workflow and not yet available in the UXP API, the recommended workaround is to continue using ExtendScript/CEP until Adobe expands the UXP API coverage or until the September 2026 deadline approaches.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0fd7a609-3020-4ff4-a375-cdefcf128644","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:54:39.538Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro UXP API limitations XML export not available workaround","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01RYJiDf1SX5RwUZTyqmHuSD","content":[{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Premiere API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Extensions - To UXP or not to UXP - Adobe Product Community - 11326933","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-extensions-to-uxp-or-not-to-uxp/td-p/11326933"},{"title":"P: 25.6.2 Missing Text Panel; Empty UXP Panels - Page 3 - Adobe Product Community - 15604156","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-bugs/p-25-6-2-missing-text-panel-empty-uxp-panels/idc-p/15611541"},{"title":"Re: P: Premiere Pro Won’t Export / UI Frozen — Need Help","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-bugs/p-25-6-2-missing-text-panel-empty-uxp-panels/idc-p/15615326"},{"title":"Problem with exporting XML from Premiere - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/problem-with-exporting-xml-from-premiere/"},{"title":"Re: Premiere Pro Won’t Export / UI Frozen — Need Help","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-bugs/p-25-6-2-missing-text-panel-empty-uxp-panels/idc-p/15611230"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about Premiere Pro UXP API limitations regarding XML export:\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP API and XML Export Limitations\n\n### Current State of UXP in Premiere Pro\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform).

These methods exist only in the legacy **ExtendScript API** which remains supported until September 2026.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Export Sequence to FCP XML (ExtendScript Only)\n\n### Sequence-Level Export\n```javascript\n// Export a single sequence to FCP XML\napp.project.sequences[index].exportAsFinalCutProXML(outputPath)\n```\n- **Parameters**: `outputPath` (String) - destination path for XML file\n- **Returns**: Boolean (`true` if successful)\n- **Description**: Creates FCP XML representation of the sequence and constituent media\n\n### Project-Level Export\n```javascript\n// Export entire project to FCP XML  \napp.project.exportFinalCutProXML(outputPath, suppressUI)\n```\n- **Parameters**: \n  - `outputPath` (String) - destination path\n  - `suppressUI` (Integer) - suppress UI dialogs if non-zero\n- **Returns**: Integer (`0` if successful)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Import XML as Sequence (ExtendScript Only)\n\n```javascript\n// Open FCP XML file as a Premiere Pro project\napp.openFCPXML(path, projPath)\n```\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `path` (String) - path to FCP XML file\n  - `projPath` (String) - path for new Premiere project\n- **Returns**: Boolean (`true` if successful)\n- **Note**: Opens XML as a NEW project, not import into existing project\n\n### Known Issues with Import\n- The `app.openFCPXML()` method has reported issues in some Premiere versions\n- `app.project.importFiles()` does not reliably handle XML files\n- FCPXML (FCP X format) requires conversion to standard XML first\n\n---\n\n## 3. UXP API - What IS Available\n\nFrom the TypeScript definitions, the UXP `Project` class has these import methods:\n\n```typescript\n// Import sequences from another Premiere project\nproject.importSequences(projectPath: string, sequenceIds?: Guid[]): Promise<boolean>\n\n// Import media files\nproject.importFiles(\n  filePaths: string[],\n  suppressUI?: boolean,\n  targetBin?: ProjectItem,\n  asNumberedStills?: boolean\n): Promise<boolean>\n\n// Import After Effects compositions\nproject.importAEComps(aepPath: string, compNames: string[], TargetBin?: ProjectItem): Promise<boolean>\nproject.importAllAEComps(aepPath: string, TargetBin?: ProjectItem): Promise<boolean>\n```\n\nThe UXP `Sequence` class has NO export methods for XML format. Available methods include:\n- `createCloneAction()` - clone sequence\n- `createSubsequence()` - create nested sequence\n- Track/clip manipulation methods\n\n---\n\n## 4. UXP File Path Handling\n\n```javascript\n// Access the file system\nconst fs = require(\"uxp\").storage.localFileSystem;\n\n// Key methods for file access\nfs.getFileForSaving(\"filename.xml\")    // Save file picker dialog\nfs.getFileForOpening()                  // Open file picker dialog  \nfs.getFolder()                          // Folder picker dialog\nfs.getTemporaryFolder()                 // Temp folder (no UI)\nfs.getDataFolder()                      // Plugin data folder (no UI)\nfs.getPluginFolder()                    // Plugin install folder (read-only)\n\n// Create entry from URL path\nfs.createEntryWithUrl(\"file:/Users/user/Documents/output.xml\")\n```\n\n### File Access Restrictions\n- UXP does NOT allow arbitrary filesystem access\n- Files outside plugin/data/temp folders require user picker dialog\n- Tokens can be used to persist file access across sessions\n\n---\n\n## 5. Limitations and Gotchas\n\n### UXP API Limitations\n1. **No XML export/import methods** - These are ExtendScript-only\n2. **Async vs Sync**: UXP methods are async (use `await`), ExtendScript was sync\n3. **File access restricted** - Must use picker dialogs or predefined folders\n4. **API incomplete** - Many ExtendScript features not yet ported to UXP\n\n### ExtendScript Limitations\n1. **Blocks UI** - All calls are synchronous\n2. **Deprecated** - Support ends September 2026\n3. **Import issues** - `app.openFCPXML()` has reported bugs\n4. **Format restrictions** - FCPXML requires conversion to standard XML\n\n### XML Format Considerations\n- Merged clips become nested sequences in FCP\n- Audio pan, gain, level changes may not transfer accurately\n- Complex effects/transitions may not translate exactly\n\n---\n\n## 6. Recommended Approach for XML Export/Import\n\nSince UXP lacks XML functionality, you have two options:\n\n### Option A: Continue Using ExtendScript (Until Sept 2026)\n```javascript\n// ExtendScript export\nvar seq = app.project.activeSequence;\nvar success = seq.exportAsFinalCutProXML(\"/path/to/output.xml\");\n\n// ExtendScript import\nvar success = app.openFCPXML(\"/path/to/input.xml\", \"/path/to/new/project.prproj\");\n```\n\n### Option B: Hybrid UXP + ExtendScript\nUse UXP for UI/modern features and call ExtendScript for XML operations via remaining CEP bridge (if available).\n\n---\n\n## Official Documentation Sources\n\n- [Premiere Pro UXP API](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Premiere UXP API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [Sequence Class (UXP)](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/sequence/)\n- [Project Class (UXP)](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/project/)\n- [ExtendScript Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [Sequence Object (ExtendScript)](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/sequence/sequence/)\n- [UXP Samples Repository](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [CEP PProPanel Samples](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel)\n- [UXP TypeScript Definitions](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\n**For XML export/import functionality, you must use ExtendScript (not UXP)**. The key methods are:\n- Export: `sequence.exportAsFinalCutProXML(path)` or `project.exportFinalCutProXML(path, suppressUI)`\n- Import: `app.openFCPXML(xmlPath, projectPath)` - opens as new project\n\nAdobe has not yet ported these methods to UXP. ExtendScript remains supported until September 2026, so this approach is viable for current development."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":484,"cache_read_input_tokens":27533,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":484,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGiE2jWXmYudNuyL9oWu","type":"assistant","uuid":"fd9a54b9-108b-428d-ab74-fdfc2d8c6b40","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:55:30.959Z"}
