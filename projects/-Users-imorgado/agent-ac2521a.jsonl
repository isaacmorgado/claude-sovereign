This was confirmed in an Adobe Community discussion from October 2025.\n\n### Current Limitations\n\nThere is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool. In PPro, all markers and metadata associated with trackItems, are actually attached to the backing projectItem; it's not possible to have different markers and metadata for each trackItem. [Same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n\n### What IS Possible with UXP/CEP\n\nAccording to the Adobe community discussion, these operations are supported:\n\n- Placing trackItems in a sequence = no problem. [This is the same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n- Export .srt file = no problem. You would use an output preset (.epr file) that specifies whatever settings you want. [Same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n- Each projectItem has XMP metadata (which includes markers); width/height info is included in that. [Same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n\n### Manual Workaround\n\nFor manual editing, if you're a keyboard shortcut junkie, ⌘+K (or Ctrl+K if you're editing with a PC) may already be your cutting technique of choice.

This was confirmed in an Adobe Community discussion from October 2025.\n\n### Current Limitations\n\nThere is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool. In PPro, all markers and metadata associated with trackItems, are actually attached to the backing projectItem; it's not possible to have different markers and metadata for each trackItem. [Same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n\n### What IS Possible with UXP/CEP\n\nAccording to the Adobe community discussion, these operations are supported:\n\n- Placing trackItems in a sequence = no problem. [This is the same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n- Export .srt file = no problem. You would use an output preset (.epr file) that specifies whatever settings you want. [Same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n- Each projectItem has XMP metadata (which includes markers); width/height info is included in that. [Same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n\n### Manual Workaround\n\nFor manual editing, if you're a keyboard shortcut junkie, ⌘+K (or Ctrl+K if you're editing with a PC) may already be your cutting technique of choice. The way Playhead Splitting works is that when you enter ⌘+K while clicked into your timeline, the command splits your selected clip right at the playhead marker.\n\n### Summary\n\nUnfortunately, as of the latest information available, **there is no programmatic way to split/cut clips using the UXP API** in Premiere Pro. You would need to work around this limitation by:\n1. Adding clips with specific in/out points to sequences\n2. Using workarounds that don't require actual razor cuts\n3.

But definitely let Adobe know what features you need in UXP to make sure they get added.\n\n### What IS Available in UXP\n\nPlacing trackItems in a sequence = no problem. [This is the same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.] Export .srt file = no problem. You would use an output preset (.epr file) that specifies whatever settings you want.\n\n### Limitations with Markers and Metadata\n\nIn PPro, all markers and metadata associated with trackItems, are actually attached to the backing projectItem; it's not possible to have different markers and metadata for each trackItem. [Same for CEP+ExtendScript and UXP.]\n\n### CEP/ExtendScript Alternative\n\nAdobe is working on phasing out CEP extensions in favor of UXP extensions. This is a CEP plugin, and so will eventually need to be ported to UXP. As of December, 2023, Premiere does not yet support UXP.\n\n### About the UXP Platform\n\nUXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level. With UXP, you can build unique tools that integrate with and optimize the most precise, demanding workflows. These tools reduce repetition, maximize efficiency, and transform Premiere into a bespoke application tailored to the needs of any project.\n\nThe search didn't return direct results from `forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com`, but the Adobe Community forum discussions reference that forum as the best place for Premiere Pro UXP discussions.

Can UXP Modify Existing TrackItem Properties (inPoint, outPoint, start, end)?\n\n**Partially - with significant limitations:**\n\n| Property | Read | Write | Method |\n|----------|------|-------|--------|\n| inPoint | Yes | **BROKEN** | `getInPoint()` / `createSetInPointAction()` |\n| outPoint | Yes | **BROKEN** | `getOutPoint()` / `createSetOutPointAction()` |\n| start | Yes | Yes | `getStartTime()` / `createSetStartAction()` |\n| end | Yes | Yes | `getEndTime()` / `createSetEndAction()` |\n\n**Critical Finding:** According to Adobe staff (CathyDong) on the forums: `trackItem.createSetInPointAction` and `createSetOutPointAction` are **broken** and cannot be relied upon for trimming operations. The recommended workaround is to use `createSetStartAction` and `createSetEndAction` for resizing durations instead.\n\n---\n\n### 2. SequenceEditor API Details\n\nThe `SequenceEditor` class provides timeline editing capabilities:\n\n```typescript\n// Get editor reference\nSequenceEditor.getEditor(sequenceObject: Sequence): SequenceEditor\n\n// Key methods:\ncreateInsertProjectItemAction(projectItem, time, videoTrackIndex, audioTrackIndex, limitShift): Action\ncreateRemoveItemsAction(trackItemSelection, ripple, mediaType, shiftOverLapping?): Action\ncreateCloneTrackItemAction(trackItem, timeOffset, videoTrackVerticalOffset, audioTrackVerticalOffset, alignToVideo, isInsert): Action\n```\n\n**Important:** All actions must be executed within `lockedAccess()` and `executeTransaction()` for proper functioning.\n\n---\n\n### 3. createCloneTrackItemAction() Capabilities\n\n**Full Signature:**\n```typescript\ncreateCloneTrackItemAction(\n  trackItem: VideoClipTrackItem | AudioClipTrackItem,\n  timeOffset: TickTime,                    // Offset from original position\n  videoTrackVerticalOffset: number,        // Track offset (0 = same track, 1 = track above)\n  audioTrackVerticalOffset: number,        // Audio track offset\n  alignToVideo: boolean,                   // Align audio to video track\n  isInsert: boolean                        // true = insert edit, false = overwrite edit\n): Action\n```\n\n**What it can do:**\n- Duplicate a trackItem to a different position/track\n- Use insert or overwrite edit modes\n- Offset to different tracks (video/audio)\n\n**What it CANNOT do directly:**\n- Set different in/out points during the clone operation\n- The cloned item inherits the source item's in/out points\n\n---\n\n### 4. Simulating Cuts/Splits in UXP\n\n**There is NO UXP API that mimics the razor tool.** This was explicitly confirmed by Adobe employee bbb_999 in October 2025.\n\n**Scene Edit Detection Alternative:**\n```typescript\nperformSceneEditDetectionOnSelection(\n  clipOperation: string,           // 'SEQUENCE_OPERATION_APPLYCUT', 'SEQUENCE_OPERATION_CREATEMARKER', etc.\n  trackItemSelection: TrackItemSelection\n): Promise<boolean>\n```\nThis can apply cuts based on scene detection but is not a programmatic razor tool.\n\n---\n\n### 5. TrackItem Class Properties (VideoClipTrackItem/AudioClipTrackItem)\n\n**Readable Properties/Methods:**\n- `getInPoint(): Promise<TickTime>` - In point relative to source media\n- `getOutPoint(): Promise<TickTime>` - Out point relative to source media\n- `getStartTime(): Promise<TickTime>` - Start position in sequence\n- `getEndTime(): Promise<TickTime>` - End position in sequence\n- `getDuration(): Promise<TickTime>` - Duration in sequence\n- `getTrackIndex(): Promise<number>`\n- `getMediaType(): Promise<Guid>`\n- `isDisabled(): Promise<boolean>`\n\n**Writable (via Actions):**\n- `createSetStartAction(tickTime)` - **Works** - moves/resizes from start\n- `createSetEndAction(tickTime)` - **Works** - moves/resizes from end\n- `createSetInPointAction(tickTime)` - **BROKEN** as of v25.4.0\n- `createSetOutPointAction(tickTime)` - **BROKEN** as of v25.4.0\n- `createSetDisabledAction(disabled)`\n- `createSetNameAction(name)`\n\n---\n\n### 6. Workarounds for Simulating Razor in UXP\n\n**Theoretical Workaround (Clone + Trim Approach):**\n\nSince `createSetInPointAction`/`createSetOutPointAction` are broken, this approach may not work reliably:\n\n```typescript\n// Theoretical workflow - MAY NOT WORK due to broken APIs\nasync function simulateCut(trackItem, cutPoint) {\n  const editor = SequenceEditor.getEditor(sequence);\n  \n  // 1. Clone the original clip\n  const cloneAction = editor.createCloneTrackItemAction(\n    trackItem, \n    TickTime.zero,  // Same position initially\n    0, 0, true, false\n  );\n  \n  // 2. After clone, modify the original's end point\n  const trimOriginalEnd = trackItem.createSetEndAction(cutPoint);\n  \n  // 3. Modify the clone's start point\n  // ... but getting reference to cloned item is problematic\n  \n  // Execute in transaction\n  await lockedAccess(async () => {\n    await executeTransaction(cloneAction);\n    // Additional actions...\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**The Problem:** \n- `createSetInPointAction` and `createSetOutPointAction` are broken\n- `createSetStartAction` and `createSetEndAction` work but may not provide the precise trim behavior needed\n- After cloning, there's no direct way to get a reference to the newly cloned item\n\n**Alternative Approach - ProjectItem In/Out Points:**\n```typescript\n// Set in/out on ProjectItem BEFORE inserting to sequence\nconst inOutAction = clipProjectItem.createSetInOutPointsAction(inPoint, outPoint);\nawait lockedAccess(async () => {\n  await executeTransaction(inOutAction);\n});\n\n// Then insert - the clip will use those in/out points\nconst insertAction = editor.createInsertProjectItemAction(\n  projectItem, insertTime, videoTrackIndex, audioTrackIndex, false\n);\n```\n\n**Limitation:** This affects the source ProjectItem globally, not individual TrackItems.\n\n---\n\n### Summary: Can You Simulate a Cut by Cloning and Trimming?\n\n**Short Answer: Not reliably with current UXP APIs.**\n\n| Requirement | Status |\n|-------------|--------|\n| Clone a track item | Yes - `createCloneTrackItemAction` |\n| Set different in/out points on clone | **No** - `createSetInPointAction`/`createSetOutPointAction` broken |\n| Trim using start/end actions | Partial - may change position, not just content bounds |\n| Direct razor/split API | **Does not exist** |\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. Wait for Adobe to fix `createSetInPointAction`/`createSetOutPointAction`\n2. For production needs, consider CEP+ExtendScript (supported until Sept 2026)\n3.
