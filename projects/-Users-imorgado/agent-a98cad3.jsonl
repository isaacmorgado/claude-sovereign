PRPROJ files store all of the elements and information required for a video project, including video and audio clips, transitions, effects, and timeline and sequence settings.(no content)The file format is optimized for use with Premiere Pro and is not compatible with other video editing software. To open and edit a PRPROJ file, you must have Adobe Premiere Pro installed on your computer. Additionally, because PRPROJ files are saved in a proprietary format, they cannot be opened or edited with other software, and must be exported as a different file format if you need to share the project with someone who does not have access to Premiere Pro.\n\n### Programmatic Manipulation Possibilities\n\nThere are tools that can change the .prproj file to modify paths and prevent Premiere Pro from relinking files. Some users have had success with search and replace operations on the file.(no content)Some users reported they used simple Search and Replace operations, replacing their previous paths with new paths. This can work on some projects, but it's not guaranteed to work 100% of the time. If you change all paths directly you might change other places in your project, leading to a corrupted or unusable Premiere Pro project.\n\n### Timeline Editing Within Premiere Pro\n\nFor splitting clips and timeline manipulation within the application:\n\nYou can use the Razor tool to divide a clip into two pieces you can move separately.(no content)To split a clip into two, select the clip in the timeline and drag the playhead to the place you want the split to occur (you can also use the < and > keys or zoom into the timeline to get a precise cut) and then click Split. After you split a clip, you can rearrange the two clips and move them around separately within your timeline.\n\n### Alternative Approach: XML Export\n\nAn alternative approach mentioned is using \"an accompanying Premiere Pro XML file or Premiere project file containing your ordered selects in a timeline.\"\n\n## Summary\n\nThe search results indicate that **direct programmatic editing of .prproj files is challenging** because it's a proprietary format. While some path manipulation is possible through text-based find-and-replace operations, full timeline manipulation (like splitting clips) isn't well-documented for programmatic access. For interchange with other applications or scripted workflows, exporting to XML format may be a more viable approach. The .prproj format is designed to be opened and edited only within Adobe Premiere Pro itself.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"46aa7285-84a2-4ddc-aea8-cc90b9593032","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:39:30.038Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"programmatically edit .prproj files split clips timeline manipulation","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01CsHs8hCWRqcKBatKyfjBHZ","content":[{"title":"Premiere Pro tutorial: Trimming clips on the Timeline in Premiere Pro","url":"https://www.agitraining.com/adobe/premiere-pro/tutorials/trimming-clips-on-the-timeline-in-premiere-pro?page=3"},{"title":"PRPROJ File Format - Adobe Premiere Pro Project","url":"https://docs.fileformat.com/video/prproj/"},{"title":"Re: Question: How do I Share Premiere Pro projects... - Adobe Product Community - 12389014","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/question-how-do-i-share-premiere-pro-projects-pass-to-another-editor/m-p/12389112"},{"title":"How to create and edit sequences | Adobe Premiere Pro tutorials","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/ph_fil/premiere-pro/how-to/create-edit-sequence.html"},{"title":"How clips work across projects in a Production","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/how-clips-work-inside-production.html"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Timeline Shifts (or First Frame) After Moving Project or Relinking Footage | BRAW Studio Blackmagic RAW Importer for Adobe Premiere & After","url":"https://www.autokroma.com/blog/Premiere-Pro-Timeline-Shift-First-Frame-After-Moving-Project-Relinking"},{"title":"Adobe Premiere Pro CC Tutorial for JO706 Digital Toolkit","url":"http://buphotojournalism.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Adobe-Premiere-.pdf"},{"title":"The Ultimate Guide to Premiere Pro Productions - Frame.io Insider","url":"https://blog.frame.io/2024/09/30/ultimate-guide-to-premiere-pro-productions/"},{"title":"Using the Timeline and Workflow in Adobe Premiere Pro CC | ProfileTree","url":"https://profiletree.com/timeline-workflow-premiere-pro-cc/"},{"title":"Edit video clips in Premiere Rush timeline","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-rush/help/edit-timeline.html"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about programmatically editing .prproj files for split clips and timeline manipulation:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### About the .prproj File Format\n\nThe PRPROJ file format is the proprietary project file format used by Adobe Premiere Pro.

Premiere Pro version numbers can be found in the XML Project tag.(no content)A Premiere project (.prproj) file is basically an xml file wrapped up in gzip compression. One of the nodes contains a version number corresponding to the version of Premiere which created it.\n\n### File Format Statistics\n\n90% of all PRPROJ files store the data in the GZIP file format. Gzip is a compressed archive file format.(no content)6% of all PRPROJ files are Premiere Project files, which are based on the XML file format. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a simple text-based format for representing structured information.\n\n### Content and References\n\nA PRPROJ file is a video project created by Adobe Premiere Pro, a video editing application. It contains a timeline comprised of video and audio clips and includes transitions, special effects, and other applied edits. PRPROJ files also store project settings related to transitions, the video renderer, audio and video display format, and the capture format.(no content)PRPROJ files store references to media assets (video, audio, graphics); they do not store the actual media data in the file itself. The references to these media assets are created when you import the asset into your project. Therefore, if you move the asset after importing it, Premiere Pro will not be able to locate the asset for the project.\n\n### Version Compatibility and Reverse Engineering\n\nPremiere checks the version number when opening a file and refuses to open anything with a lower version number. Tools exist that can change the version number to '1' and create a gzip compressed file which Premiere can read.(no content)It's possible to edit the version information of Adobe Premiere Pro (*.prproj) project files to make them backwards compatible with older versions of the Adobe Premiere Pro CC software.\n\n**Note:** There doesn't appear to be an official Adobe specification document publicly available for the PRPROJ format.

With it, you can apply ready-made presets and transitions with a single click, change their color and speed, and instantly make your video more appealing.\n\n### How It Works:\n\nThis extension is a panel for After Effects and Premiere that helps you create engaging videos without spending hours keyframing or adjusting layers one by one.\n\n**Key Mechanism:**\n- A Motion Bro package is essentially a ready collection of presets and transitions designed to work smoothly with Motion Bro. Everything is pre-organized and standardized, so you can apply them with a single click.\n\n- The difference from a regular After Effects preset is that a normal preset is just a simple effect file, while Motion Bro gives you a panel, quick control, and easy organization.\n\n- Just select a preset and click 'Apply' to achieve professional results. No advanced skills required – simply choose a preset and apply it instantly. Master Scene allows you to link all presets to a master control and adjust effects from one place.\n\n**Installation:**\nYou can install the Motion Bro plugin through Creative Cloud Desktop App or manually.(no content)To launch the plugin, in After Effects or Premiere Pro go to: Window > Extensions > Motion Bro 4.x.\n\n---\n\n## Premiere Composer\n\nPremiere Composer revolutionizes text animation and motion graphics within Premiere Pro. While Adobe After Effects has long been the go-to tool for creating dynamic text animations, Premiere Composer brings these capabilities directly into your editing workspace, eliminating the need to switch between applications for most text animation needs.\n\n### How It Works:\n\nThe plugin comes with an extensive library of pre-designed text animation templates covering everything from simple lower thirds to complex title sequences and call-outs. All templates are fully customizable—you can adjust colors, timing, fonts, and animation parameters to match your project's aesthetic without needing to understand the underlying animation principles.\n\n---\n\n## Key Differences\n\nMotion Bro Install serves as the gateway to one of the most comprehensive animation systems available for Premiere Pro. This installation manager plugin makes it remarkably easy to integrate a wide range of motion graphics templates, transitions, and effects into your editing workflow. Rather than dealing with complex installation procedures for different animation packs, Motion Bro Install provides a unified framework that streamlines the entire process.\n\nBoth plugins essentially work by providing a unified panel interface within Adobe applications that allows users to browse, preview, and apply pre-built animation presets and transitions without manual keyframing work.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"97e7e3fd-3edc-47e1-bfcd-0715be258757","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:40:11.761Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Composer Motion Bro how they work plugin mechanism","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01FzHrmqMcYqCZ7KNvuFe8K5","content":[{"title":"Plugin – Motion Bro","url":"https://motionbro.com/plugin/"},{"title":"Motion Bro Plugin: The Ultimate Preset and Transition Panel for After Effects and Premiere Pro","url":"https://blog.gfxplugin.com/post/motion-bro/"},{"title":"6 Adobe Premiere Pro plugins & extensions for creative teams - GoVisually","url":"https://govisually.com/blog/6-adobe-premiere-pro-plugins-extensions-for-creative-teams/"},{"title":"Motion Bro V5.0.6 For After Effects & Premiere Pro [New]","url":"https://riztagar.com/motion-bro-4-for-after-effects-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Motion Bro for Premiere Pro – Motion Bro","url":"https://motionbro.net/help/video-tutorials/motion-bro-for-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Best 3 Premiere Pro Plugins","url":"https://cutback.video/blog/top-3-premiere-pro-plugins"},{"title":"How to apply presets in Premiere Pro? – Motion Bro","url":"https://motionbro.com/help/how-to-apply-presets-in-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Help Center – Motion Bro","url":"https://motionbro.net/help/"},{"title":"Motion Bro v5.0.6 For After Effects & Premiere Pro - INTRO HD","url":"https://intro-hd.net/motion-bro-4-for-after-effects-premiere-pro-working-100/"},{"title":"How to install the Motion Bro plugin? – Motion Bro","url":"https://motionbro.com/help/how-to-install-the-motion-bro-plugin/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's how **Premiere Composer** and **Motion Bro** work as plugins:\n\n## Motion Bro\n\nMotion Bro is a plugin for After Effects and Premiere Pro that makes your work much easier.

Some complex effects and transitions might not translate exactly.\n\n### Importing from Final Cut Pro to Premiere Pro\n\nYou can import entire projects, selected clips, or selected sequences that you export from Final Cut Pro as XML files. In Premiere Pro, bins and clips have the same hierarchies and names that they have in the Final Cut Pro source projects. Premiere Pro also retains the sequence markers, sequence settings, track layout, locked tracks, and sequence timecode start points of Final Cut Pro source projects.(no content)Final Cut Pro X exports a .fcpxml file, which Premiere Pro does not recognize. To bring in an FCP X file into Premiere Pro, you need a converter tool that converts the .fcpxml file generated from Final Cut Pro X into a standard .xml file. Adobe recommends using the XtoCC tool for this conversion.\n\n### Third-Party Tools\n\n**SendToX** (for Premiere Pro → Final Cut Pro X):\nSendToX translates Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro 6/7 XML to Final Cut Pro XML using three simple methods: Run SendToX and use the Open dialog, drag-and-drop the XML file onto the SendToX app icon, or right-click on the XML file in Finder and choose Open With > SendToX.\n\n**XtoCC** (for Final Cut Pro X → Premiere Pro):\nXtoCC allows you to take your Final Cut Pro event clips and/or project(s) directly to Adobe Premiere Pro CC or CS6, Adobe Audition CC, Adobe After Effects CC, Final Cut Pro 6, Final Cut Pro 7, or other Final Cut Pro 7 XML-based workflow tools.\n\n### Key Considerations\n\nAn XML file contains pointers to all clips, but not the actual media, as well as settings for just about everything in the project file.(no content)Effects, titles, and generators that are in one system but not another don't transfer. However, the bulk of editing work—figuring out the best way to tell the story, editing and trimming clips, and applying basic transitions—all transfers. Cool effects and color grading don't.(no content)Premiere Pro works with a slightly modified xmeml based on the XML from FCP Classic version 6—not the latest—that has Adobe specific tags included.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"cac5009c-7a94-4d9e-81f4-86733a3f161d","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:40:15.683Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro XML export import Final Cut Pro XML timeline manipulation","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0133mBQRokYfAxvui3YdiP7J","content":[{"title":"Export projects as Final Cut Pro XML in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere/desktop/render-and-export/export-files/export-a-project-as-a-final-cut-pro-xml-file.html"},{"title":"Import XML files from Final Cut Pro 7 and Final Cut Pro X","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/importing-xml-project-files-final.html"},{"title":"EXPORTING XML for FINAL CUT? - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/exporting-xml-for-final-cutae/"},{"title":"Future-Proof Media Projects: Export XML Files From Premiere or Final Cut [u] | Larry Jordan","url":"https://larryjordan.com/articles/export-xml-files-to-safely-future-proof-media-projects-using-premiere-or-final-cut/"},{"title":"SendToX – Intelligent Assistance Software","url":"http://intelligentassistance.com/sendtox.html"},{"title":"XtoCC Help – Intelligent Assistance Software","url":"https://www.intelligentassistance.com/xtocc-help/"},{"title":"Using XML Files to Move Your Timeline to a Different NLE","url":"https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/xml-files-premiere-fcpx-davinci/"},{"title":"Transfer Sequences From Premiere Pro CC to Final Cut Pro X | Larry Jordan","url":"https://larryjordan.com/articles/move-sequences-between-premiere-pro-cc-and-final-cut-pro-x/"},{"title":"Demystifying Final Cut Pro XMLs","url":"https://fcp.cafe/developer-case-studies/fcpxml/"},{"title":"Use XML to transfer projects in Final Cut Pro for Mac - Apple Support","url":"https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/use-xml-to-transfer-projects-verdbd66ae/mac"}]},"Here are the search results for \"Premiere Pro XML export import Final Cut Pro XML timeline manipulation\":\n\n## Overview\n\nXML (Extensible Markup Language) files allow you to transfer projects and timelines between Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro.

Pymiere sends the ExtendScript code to the Pymiere Link extension via the requests library using HTTP. The Pymiere Link extension is essentially a node.js server which receives the ExtendScript code and executes it within Premiere Pro.(no content)Where required, Pymiere Link will return data as a JSON encoded response back to Pymiere. Pymiere will then decode the JSON response for further processing in Python.\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n- You must have Premiere Pro running for Pymiere to work - it can't run \"headlessly\".\n- Requires the Pymiere Link extension for Premiere (installed separately).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nTested with Adobe Premiere Pro version 23.1 (2023), version 15.1 (2021), version 14.5 (2020), version 13.0 (2019) and version 11.0 (2017). Version 2019+ is highly recommended because some functionality isn't available in the previous versions, though it should work for version 2017+.\n\n## Current Status\n\nPymiere is not maintained anymore. It should still work fine but some newer parts of the Premiere Pro API may not be wrapped.(no content)The python package pymiere receives a total of 111 weekly downloads. As such, pymiere popularity was classified as limited.\n\n## Important Note About Adobe's Direction\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.(no content)It's worth noting that Premiere Pro has no official Python API; the fact that Pymiere works at all should be considered a 'happy accident.'

The Pymiere Link extension is essentially a node.js server which receives the ExtendScript code and executes it within Premiere Pro.(no content)Where required, Pymiere Link will return data as a JSON encoded response back to Pymiere. Pymiere will then decode the JSON response for further processing in Python.\n\n## Key Requirements\n\n- You must have Premiere Pro running for Pymiere to work - it can't run \"headlessly\".\n- Requires the Pymiere Link extension for Premiere (installed separately).\n\n## Compatibility\n\nTested with Adobe Premiere Pro version 23.1 (2023), version 15.1 (2021), version 14.5 (2020), version 13.0 (2019) and version 11.0 (2017). Version 2019+ is highly recommended because some functionality isn't available in the previous versions, though it should work for version 2017+.\n\n## Current Status\n\nPymiere is not maintained anymore. It should still work fine but some newer parts of the Premiere Pro API may not be wrapped.(no content)The python package pymiere receives a total of 111 weekly downloads. As such, pymiere popularity was classified as limited.\n\n## Important Note About Adobe's Direction\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.(no content)It's worth noting that Premiere Pro has no official Python API; the fact that Pymiere works at all should be considered a 'happy accident.' Adobe is happy to help with questions regarding PPro's CEP+ExtendScript APIs."],"durationSeconds":24.10966037499998}}

Luckily at least the format itself is versioned (which is why Premiere rejects .prproj files generated by newer versions of Premiere).\n\n### Creating .prproj Files Externally\nIf you want to create a Premiere Pro project file (.prproj) without using Premiere Pro, this is not advised. However, Premiere Pro does have an API which will probably allow you to do what you need.\n\n### Scripting API\nThe Premiere Pro scripting API provides methods like `app.project.rootItem.children[index].canChangeMediaPath()` which returns true if Premiere Pro can change the path associated with a project item.(no content)`app.project.rootItem.children[index].changeMediaPath(newPath)` updates the project item to point to a new media path and returns 0 if replacement was successful.\n\n### XML vs FCP XML\nThe version of XML that is exported by Adobe Premiere Pro is technically an XML format created by the previous generation of Final Cut Pro from 2003-2011. This is different from the native .prproj XML structure.\n\nUnfortunately, the search results did not return specific documentation about the internal node structure you mentioned (sequence, VideoMediaSource, ClipProjectItem nodes).

Luckily at least the format itself is versioned (which is why Premiere rejects .prproj files generated by newer versions of Premiere).\n\n### Creating .prproj Files Externally\nIf you want to create a Premiere Pro project file (.prproj) without using Premiere Pro, this is not advised. However, Premiere Pro does have an API which will probably allow you to do what you need.\n\n### Scripting API\nThe Premiere Pro scripting API provides methods like `app.project.rootItem.children[index].canChangeMediaPath()` which returns true if Premiere Pro can change the path associated with a project item.(no content)`app.project.rootItem.children[index].changeMediaPath(newPath)` updates the project item to point to a new media path and returns 0 if replacement was successful.\n\n### XML vs FCP XML\nThe version of XML that is exported by Adobe Premiere Pro is technically an XML format created by the previous generation of Final Cut Pro from 2003-2011. This is different from the native .prproj XML structure.\n\nUnfortunately, the search results did not return specific documentation about the internal node structure you mentioned (sequence, VideoMediaSource, ClipProjectItem nodes). The .prproj format is **undocumented by Adobe**, making detailed structural information difficult to find publicly. If you need to work with these specific elements, you may need to:\n\n1. Decompress a .prproj file (it's gzipped) and examine the XML structure directly\n2. Use the official [Premiere Pro Scripting API](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/) rather than manipulating the XML directly\n3.

PRPROJ files store all of the elements and information required for a video project, including video and audio clips, transitions, effects, and timeline and sequence settings.\n\n### Technical Limitations\nThe maximum sequence frame size in pixels is 10,240×8,192 (width x height).(no content)Still image and movie size: The maximum frame size to import still images and movies is 256 megapixels, with a maximum dimension of 32,768 pixels in either direction.\n\n### Supported Project/Exchange Formats\nPremiere Pro also supports various project file types from Adobe apps and other video editing software: PRPROJ (Premiere Pro project files), AEP/AEPX (After Effects projects), XML (FCP XML for interoperability), AAF (Advanced Authoring Format), and EDL (Edit Decision Lists - CMX3600).\n\n**Note**: Adobe does not publicly publish detailed technical specifications for its proprietary PRPROJ format.

Instead, you would adjust the duration of the existing trackItem, then insert a new trackItem, representing the remaining portion of the original trackItem.\"(no content)There is no split method. You could truncate (change the end point) of the earlier trackItem, and insert a new trackItem (based on the same projectItem) at the end of the earlier trackItem.\n\n### QE DOM Razor Method (Alternative Approach)\n\nThere's no cut function in extendscript API. QE DOM has razor(string, bool, bool) method on sequence and track objects but I failed to get it to work.\n\nHowever, some users have reported success with the QE DOM razor method. One example shows applying the cut to audio tracks by looping through tracks and calling `audioTrack.razor(timecodeString, true)` on each track.(no content)After a long time of searching, one user \"found out it was about calling the RAZOR method, which I never knew existed.\"\n\n### Workarounds\n\nAs a workaround you can use overwriteClip() with one-frame media and then delete that new media immediately, so you will have two desired cut clips BUT with one frame gap. Another workaround is adjusting inPoint, outPoint, start and end, but it is a bit tricky: clip's inPoint and outPoint work in a strange nonobvious way, so make tests first.\n\n### Recommended Approach\n\nYou would create a new trackItem using everything you know (source projectItem, speed changes, footage reinterpretation) about the trackItem you're \"cutting\" (truncating).(no content)A Time() object will perform the conversion for you; see PProPanel. There are 254016000000 ticks/second.\n\n### UXP API Status\n\nThere is not yet any UXP API that mimics the razor tool. In PPro, all markers and metadata associated with trackItems are actually attached to the backing projectItem; it's not possible to have different markers and metadata for each trackItem.\n\n## Summary\n\nTo split clips programmatically in Premiere Pro, you have these options:\n\n1. **Manual simulation**: Adjust the endpoint of the existing trackItem, then insert a new trackItem from the same source projectItem\n2. **QE DOM razor method**: Use `track.razor(timecodeString, boolean, boolean)` - though this is less documented and may be unreliable\n3. **Workaround with overwriteClip()**: Insert one-frame media and delete it (creates a gap)\n\nThe official PProPanel sample from Adobe's GitHub repository is recommended as a reference for working with ExtendScript in Premiere Pro.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"25111df7-76f6-427b-8fad-dab020c72f03","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:42:15.590Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro ExtendScript API split clip razor cut timeline programmatically","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01FCQaYwehmEaBJxuhacAWhU","content":[{"title":"Solved: Perform a cut from script? - Adobe Product Community - 11389974","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/perform-a-cut-from-script/td-p/11389974"},{"title":"Solved: ExtendScript: Split clip using insertClip method? - Adobe Product Community - 14432687","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/extendscript-split-clip-using-insertclip-method/m-p/14432687"},{"title":"Solved: Editing clips with ExtendScript - Adobe Product Community - 9056625","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/editing-clips-with-extendscript/td-p/9056625"},{"title":"Solved: Help Needed: ExtendScript to Cut Clips at Specific... - Adobe Product Community - 15109242","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/help-needed-extendscript-to-cut-clips-at-specific-timestamps/m-p/15109242"},{"title":"Where is detailed docs about Premiere Pro Scripting DOM API? · Issue #80 · Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/issues/80"},{"title":"Using Adobe ExtendScript to Automate Video Editing in Premiere Pro","url":"https://metadesignsolutions.com/using-adobe-extendscript-to-automate-video-editing-in-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"How to split or cut clips in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/split-or-cut-clips.html"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Scripting ExtendScript question - Adobe Product Community - 13379442","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-extendscript-question/td-p/13379442"},{"title":"Solved: UXP: Razor tool and marking clipped sections - Adobe Product Community - 15547922","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-razor-tool-and-marking-clipped-sections/td-p/15547922"},{"title":"Solved: Split Clips in Timeline w/ Keyboard Shortcut - Adobe Product Community - 5578730","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/split-clips-in-timeline-w-keyboard-shortcut/m-p/5578730"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about splitting clips programmatically in Premiere Pro using ExtendScript:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### No Direct \"Split\" or \"Cut\" Method in ExtendScript API\n\n\"There's no such thing as a 'cut', in the API.

This format is the standard for Final Cut Pro and includes transcript ranges on clip and titles on the project (aka timeline/sequence).\n\n### Time Value Format\n\nFinal Cut Pro expresses time values as a rational number of seconds with a 64-bit numerator and a 32-bit denominator. Frame rates for NTSC-compatible media, for example, use a frame duration of 1001/30000s (29.97 fps) or 1001/60000s (59.94 fps).(no content)'time' attributes are expressed as a rational number of seconds (e.g., \"1001/30000s\") with a 64-bit numerator and 32-bit denominator. Integer 'time' values, such as 5 seconds, may be expressed as whole numbers (e.g., '5s').\n\n### Key Clip Attributes\n\nThe FCPXML structure contains resources (multiple audio files, video files), project, sequence (a group of multiple assets that compose a single timeline), and spine (the outer timeline). Asset-clips have attributes including: ref (from resources section), offset (a time offset in seconds, relative to the containing spine), duration (a time in seconds of how long this asset clip is), and start.(no content)The 'offset' attribute defines the location of the object in the parent timeline (default is '0s').\n\n### Example FCPXML Clip Structure\n\nHere's an example XML element that FCP successfully imports: \n`<asset-clip ref=\"r2\" offset=\"0s\" name=\"clip.mov\" start=\"146173027/60000s\" duration=\"871871/60000s\" tcFormat=\"DF\" audioRole=\"dialogue\"></asset-clip>`\n\n### Calculating Timeline Positions\n\nFor calculating source timecode, you can use the formula: `asset-clip.start + frameOfInterest − asset-clip.offset + sync-clip.start − sync-clip.offset`\n\n### Programmatic Manipulation Utilities\n\nWhen converting time values programmatically, you may need to convert a time value that is in the start value timescale to the offset value timescale. For example, if a clip on the primary storyline has an attached clip, this will convert the attached clip's offset value to its parent clip's offset value timescale.(no content)Utility functions can return the clip's parent's equivalent offset timings for specified in and out times. This is useful for walking up an XMLElement hierarchy in order to get the time values of the clip on the project timeline.\n\n### DTD Validation\n\nYou can download all the FCPXML DTD files. You can use this Terminal Command to validate: `xmllint --dtdvalid \"/path/to/FCPXMLv1_9.dtd\" \"/path/to/file.fcpxml\"`. Simply type xmllint --dtdvalid, then drag in the DTD file from Finder, and then your FCPXML file.(no content)A DTD (Document Type Definition) file is used in XML to define the structure and the legal elements and attributes of an XML document. It's a set of markup declarations that provide a rulebook for a specific type of XML document, describing what the document contains and how those elements and attributes are organised.\n\n### Common Issues When Programmatically Creating FCPXML\n\nWhen generating FCPXML programmatically, you may encounter warnings saying that the clips were not placed at a frame boundary.(no content)Duration or offset calculation problems can cause odd timeline ends. It's recommended to start with simple, whole second durations to make sure duration and/or offset calculations are correct.\n\nFor official documentation, you can reference Apple's FCPXML Reference documentation for the complete DTD specifications.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c69f045c-19af-4975-8e92-f07b8432a961","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:42:33.177Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Final Cut Pro XML FCPXML structure clip in out points timeline manipulation programmatic","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_017hfjaUwTuD3ESYYd8D8NkJ","content":[{"title":"In/Out Points in the Timeline - Apple Final Cut Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/inout-points-in-the-timeline/"},{"title":"Demystifying Final Cut Pro XMLs","url":"https://fcp.cafe/developer-case-studies/fcpxml/"},{"title":"FCPXML","url":"https://fcp.cafe/developers/fcpxml/"},{"title":"Final Cut Pro X Tutorial: Creating the Rough Cut: Inserting clips","url":"https://www.macprovideo.com/article/apple/final-cut-pro-x-tutorial-creating-the-rough-cut-part-2-inserting-clips"},{"title":"Send your Edit to Final Cut Pro, seamlessly | Eddie AI | Your AI video editor","url":"https://help.heyeddie.ai/en/articles/9944879-send-your-edit-to-final-cut-pro-seamlessly"},{"title":"Final Cut Pro X: Editing Clips in the Timeline","url":"https://www.universalclass.com/articles/computers/final-cut-pro-x-editing-clips-in-the-timeline.htm"},{"title":"One-click timeline export to Final Cut Pro and DaVinci Resolve","url":"https://detail.co/blog/timeline-export"},{"title":"In final cut pro X: Is there a way to see what sections of clips were added to timeline? - Quora","url":"https://www.quora.com/In-final-cut-pro-X-Is-there-a-way-to-see-what-sections-of-clips-were-added-to-timeline"},{"title":"how to export a small section of the timeline- not the whole thing? - Apple Final Cut Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/how-to-export-a-small-section-of-the-timeline-not/"},{"title":"How to extract and save various segments from a long clip in FCPX. - Apple Final Cut Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/how-to-extract-and-save-various-segments-from-a-lo/"}]},{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Lk5iwDbjt2znBmXwZuyv8N","content":[{"title":"FCPXML","url":"https://fcp.cafe/developers/fcpxml/"},{"title":"fcpxml-structure.md · GitHub","url":"https://gist.github.com/allenday/44cafa9d698ae6f94c5d55205f86f5b9"},{"title":"CommandPost/src/extensions/cp/apple/fcpxml/dtd/FCPXMLv1_8.dtd at develop · CommandPost/CommandPost","url":"https://github.com/CommandPost/CommandPost/blob/develop/src/extensions/cp/apple/fcpxml/dtd/FCPXMLv1_8.dtd"},{"title":"Time Unit Calculation - Apple Final Cut Pro Legacy - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/time-unit-calculation/"},{"title":"FCPXMLUtility Structure Reference","url":"https://reuelk.github.io/pipeline/Structs/FCPXMLUtility.html"},{"title":"fcpxml asset-clip \"tcFormat\" attri… | Apple Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.developer.apple.com/forums/thread/763894"},{"title":"FCPXML File creation using script - Apple Community","url":"https://discussions.apple.com/thread/255681324"},{"title":"Blackmagic Forum • View topic - .fcpxml","url":"https://forum.blackmagicdesign.com/viewtopic.php?f=24&t=40427"},{"title":"FCPXML Reference | Apple Developer Documentation","url":"https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/FinalCutProX/Reference/FinalCutProXXMLFormat/FCPXMLDTD/FCPXMLDTD.html"},{"title":"Final Cut Pro X FCPXML Parser · GitHub","url":"https://gist.github.com/btgoodwin/6d9a252527495bb566fa"}]},"Based on the search results, I can provide you with comprehensive information about FCPXML structure, clip in/out points, and timeline manipulation for programmatic use.\n\n## FCPXML Structure for Clip In/Out Points and Timeline Manipulation\n\n### Basic Structure Overview\n\nFinal Cut Pro X's XML describes clips (and others) within a project's single primary storyline, with connected clips (and others) and secondary storylines connected to items in the primary storyline.(no content)\"FCPXML\" is a file format that defines the edit with all the clip in and out points.

What is the .prproj File Format?\n\nThe .prproj file is **gzip-compressed XML** (since Premiere Pro CC/CS6+).\n\n**Key findings:**\n- Pre-CS6: Plain XML files\n- CS6+: XML wrapped in gzip compression\n- File signature: Starts with `1f 8b 08` (gzip magic bytes)\n- Can be decompressed by renaming to `.prproj.gz` and extracting with any archive tool\n- Premiere Pro will read uncompressed XML but will re-compress on save\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Premiere Pro - Archive Team Wiki](http://fileformats.archiveteam.org/wiki/Premiere_Pro)\n- [PRPROJ File Format - FileFormat.com](https://docs.fileformat.com/video/prproj/)\n- [CGSecurity Forum - .prproj files now gzip](https://forum.cgsecurity.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=5875)\n\n---\n\n## 2. Can You Programmatically Edit .prproj Files to Split Clips?\n\n**Short answer: Technically possible but NOT recommended.**\n\nThe .prproj format uses an **ObjectID/REF reference system** where XML objects are interconnected. The PRPROJ-READER author describes it as: \"objects that are bound between ObjectID and REF attribute's values. I just followed the leads one object gave to find its relationship with another.\"\n\n**Challenges:**\n- No official specification exists\n- Format changes between Premiere versions\n- Complex interdependencies between objects\n- Version number validation (Premiere refuses to open files with version numbers from newer versions)\n\n**What IS documented for modification:**\n- Version number changes (for downgrading projects)\n- Media path changes (find/replace operations)\n- Scale and position parameters\n- Basic metadata\n\n**Sources:**\n- [PRPROJ-READER GitHub](https://github.com/sergeiventurinov/PRPROJ-READER)\n- [Adobe Community - Perform a cut from script](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/perform-a-cut-from-script/td-p/11389974)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Tools/Libraries That Parse .prproj Files\n\n### Python\n1. **PRPROJ-READER** - Reverse-engineered Python parser (~800 lines)\n   - GitHub: https://github.com/sergeiventurinov/PRPROJ-READER\n   - Capabilities: Extract clip names, frame rates, in/out points, create SRT files, batch modify parameters\n\n2. **pp_parse** - Extracts media pathnames\n   - GitHub: https://github.com/fgiraffe/pp_parse\n\n3. **pymiere** - Python to ExtendScript bridge (no longer maintained)\n   - GitHub: https://github.com/qmasingarbe/pymiere\n   - Note: Requires Premiere Pro running; communicates via HTTP to ExtendScript\n\n### Rust\n4. **prproj-rs** - Rust parser with WASM support\n   - GitHub: https://github.com/supercuts/prproj-rs\n\n### Other\n5. **prproj-git** - Version control for Premiere projects\n   - GitHub: https://github.com/andrew-verevkin/prproj-git\n\n6. **Premiere Pro Project Downgrader** - Changes version numbers\n   - GitHub: https://github.com/xiaotiehe/Premiere-Pro-Project-Downgrader\n   - Online tool: https://joshcluderay.com/downgrade-premiere-project-converter/\n\n---\n\n## 4. How Are Clips and In/Out Points Stored?\n\nBased on reverse engineering from PRPROJ-READER:\n\n**XML Structure:**\n```xml\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<PremiereData Version=\"3\">\n  <Project ObjectID=\"1\" ClassID=\"62ad66dd-0dcd-42da-a660-6d8fbde94876\" Version=\"25\">\n    <Node Version=\"1\">\n      <!-- Objects with ObjectID and REF attributes -->\n    </Node>\n  </Project>\n</PremiereData>\n```\n\n**Time values** are stored in \"ticks\" - there are **254,016,000,000 ticks per second** in Premiere Pro.\n\n**Extractable attributes include:**\n- Names (clips, sequences, folders)\n- Frame rates and frame sizes\n- In points and out points\n- Timeline positions\n\n**Sources:**\n- [PRPROJ-READER GitHub](https://github.com/sergeiventurinov/PRPROJ-READER)\n- [Adobe Community - Getting Correct Clip Timings](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/getting-correct-clip-timings-hh-mm-ss-ff-from-seconds-and-ticks/m-p/15161594)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Could a UXP Plugin Save, Edit File, Then Reopen?\n\n**Current Status (as of Premiere 25.6):**\n- UXP is now the official extensibility platform (graduated from beta)\n- ExtendScript support continues through September 2026\n\n**UXP API Capabilities:**\n- Access sequences, tracks, clips, markers, project items\n- Read project and sequence information\n- Get the active project via `app` object\n\n**Limitations:**\n- **No UXP API mimics the razor tool** currently\n- No direct \"split\" or \"cut\" method exists in either ExtendScript or UXP\n- To split clips programmatically, you must:\n  1. Adjust the endpoint of the existing trackItem\n  2. Insert a new trackItem from the same source projectItem\n\n**Workaround approaches:**\n- QE DOM `razor(timecodeString, bool, bool)` method (poorly documented)\n- `overwriteClip()` with one-frame media, then delete (creates gap)\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Adobe Premiere Pro UXP Developer Portal](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Adobe Blog - UXP Arrives in Premiere](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n- [Adobe Community - ExtendScript Split Clip](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/extendscript-split-clip-using-insertclip-method/m-p/14432687)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Risks of Direct Project File Manipulation\n\n**Major risks:**\n1. **Corruption** - Garbage data can appear between XML fields (e.g., `<NAME>&$d.~</NAME>`)\n2. **Version incompatibility** - Premiere validates version numbers and refuses mismatched files\n3. **Reference integrity** - Breaking ObjectID/REF relationships corrupts the project\n4. **Data loss** - No official validation means silent failures are possible\n5. **Unsupported by Adobe** - No recovery assistance for manually edited files\n\n**Recovery options if corrupted:**\n- Use XML tools like \"XML Wrench\" to find malformed XML\n- Check auto-save backups (`.PRPROJ backup` files)\n- Must save with exact `.prproj` extension or Premiere won't recognize it\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Adobe Community - Corrupt Project Files](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/premiere-cc-corrupt-project-files-including-auto-save/td-p/5312944)\n- [Premiere Pro Fandom - Recover Corrupt Project](https://premierepro.fandom.com/wiki/FAQ:How_do_I_recover_a_corrupt_project%3F)\n\n---\n\n## 7. Official .prproj Specifications\n\n**There are NO official Adobe specifications for .prproj.**\n\nThe format is:\n- Proprietary and undocumented\n- Changes between versions without notice\n- Versioned internally (Premiere rejects files from newer versions)\n\nAll available knowledge comes from community reverse engineering.\n\n**Sources:**\n- [FileFormat.com - PRPROJ](https://docs.fileformat.com/video/prproj/)\n- [File Extensions - PRPROJ](https://file-extensions.com/docs/prproj)\n\n---\n\n## 8. How Premiere Composer/Motion Bro Work\n\nThese plugins do **NOT edit .prproj files directly**. They work through:\n\n1. **CEP Extensions** (legacy) or **UXP Plugins** (current)\n2. Use Premiere's official scripting APIs (ExtendScript/UXP)\n3. Provide panel interfaces within Premiere\n4. Apply presets and effects through the application's internal methods\n\n**Motion Bro mechanism:**\n- Panel extension that organizes preset packages\n- One-click application of presets/transitions\n- Uses `Window > Extensions > Motion Bro` to launch\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Motion Bro Plugin Page](https://motionbro.com/plugin/)\n- [Motion Bro Help - Apply Presets](https://motionbro.com/help/how-to-apply-presets-in-premiere-pro/)\n\n---\n\n## 9. Interchange Format Workarounds\n\n### EDL (Edit Decision List)\n\n**Export:** `File > Export > EDL`\n**Import:** `File > Import` (select EDL file)\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Only 1 video track, up to 4 audio tracks\n- No nested sequences\n- No variable speed changes\n- Only basic transitions (cuts, dissolves)\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Adobe - Export EDL](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere/desktop/render-and-export/export-files/export-a-project-as-an-edl-file.html)\n- [SimonSaysAI - Working with EDLs](https://www.simonsaysai.com/blog/premiere-pro-edl)\n\n### Final Cut Pro XML\n\n**Export:** `File > Export > Final Cut Pro XML`\n**Import:** `File > Import` (for FCP 7 XML) or use XtoCC converter for FCPXML\n\n**Capabilities:**\n- Preserves sequence markers, settings, track layout\n- Supports more complex timelines than EDL\n- Merged clips convert to nested sequences\n\n**FCPXML time format:** Rational numbers (e.g., `1001/30000s` for 29.97fps)\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Adobe - Export FCP XML](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere/desktop/render-and-export/export-files/export-a-project-as-a-final-cut-pro-xml-file.html)\n- [FCPXML Reference](https://fcp.cafe/developers/fcpxml/)\n\n### AAF (Advanced Authoring Format)\n\n**Export:** `File > Export > AAF`\n**Import:** `File > Import` (for AAF from Avid Media Composer)\n\n**Best for:** Audio post-production workflows with Pro Tools/Avid\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Merged clips not supported\n- Requires relinking media after import\n- Special characters in names cause issues\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Adobe - Export AAF](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere-pro/using/export-aaf-files.html)\n- [Production Expert - AAF from Premiere](https://www.production-expert.com/production-expert-1/how-to-create-a-pro-tools-friendly-aaf-from-adobe-premiere)\n\n---\n\n## 10. Summary and Recommendations\n\n| Approach | Feasibility | Risk Level | Recommended? |\n|----------|-------------|------------|--------------|\n| Direct .prproj editing | Technically possible | HIGH | No |\n| ExtendScript API | Works but limited | LOW | Yes (until 2026) |\n| UXP API | Official, supported | LOW | Yes |\n| EDL export/import | Simple edits only | LOW | For basic cuts |\n| XML export/import | Good for interchange | LOW | For complex edits |\n| AAF export/import | Audio workflows | LOW | For audio post |\n\n**Best approach for splitting clips programmatically:**\n1. Use the UXP or ExtendScript API to adjust trackItem endpoints and insert new trackItems\n2. OR export to FCP XML, manipulate with standard XML tools, reimport\n3. Do NOT directly edit .prproj files for timeline manipulation\n\n**If you must edit .prproj directly:**\n1. Always work on copies\n2. Decompress the gzip first\n3. Use XML validators before re-compressing\n4. Test thoroughly with Premiere before relying on the result\n5. Maintain backups"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4939,"cache_read_input_tokens":29699,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4939,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGhHtHkrEfqpHPZaKDiG","type":"assistant","uuid":"19758026-d402-419c-a706-f13bef9b9f31","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:43:46.194Z"}
