It is named manifest.json and is required for all plugins. Each UXP plugin has one manifest.json file that describes the plugin.(no content)The plugin's manifest is where you include metadata about your plugin. Simply put, the manifest is a list of facts about your plugin in the form of a JSON object. No executable code goes into your manifest.\n\n### Manifest Versions\n\n**Manifest v5 (Latest):**\nManifest v5 gives developers access to a new plugin permissions model and WebViews in modal dialogs. Using the full manifest v5 feature set requires PS 23.3.0 or higher.(no content)WebViews are available with UXP 6.0, and need to be configured in your plugin's manifest (v5 required). WebViews are available within modal dialogs only for now.\n\n### Key Manifest Fields\n\n**Top-Level Structure:**\nThe top level of the manifest JSON object contains high-level information about your plugin.\n\n**Required Fields:**\nDevelop - required field for the plugin to be loaded. Publish - required field for plugins to be submitted in the Adobe Developer Console and published in the Plugin Manager.\n\n**Host Field:**\nThe host field is an object matching the HostDefinition format. This entry allows your plugin to specify which app your plugin can run on such as Adobe XD or Photoshop. During development, the field can contain an array of HostDefinitions. This can be very convenient during development of cross-compatible UXP plugins. However, during submission to the marketplace, only one HostDefinition is allowed.\n\n**Entry Points:**\nThe entrypoints field is an array of objects matching the EntryPointDefinition format. These entries appear both in the Plugins menu in the native menubar, and the plugin panel. Each entry point specifies a type, to create either a direct-action command or a panel show/hide command.\n\n**Localization:**\nPlugin menu item labels or panel labels can be localized to match the host's current UI language setting. Other manifest fields such as name cannot be localized yet.\n\n### Permissions (Manifest v5)\nTo ensure that plugins are secure, UXP requires that plugins declare the permissions they need to function.(no content)If enabled, the plugin can communicate with other installed plugins. Defaults to false.\n\n### Official Documentation Resources\n\n1. **Photoshop UXP Manifest v4**: https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/\n2. **Photoshop UXP Manifest v5**: https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v5/\n3. **XD Manifest v4**: https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/manifest/\n4. **InDesign Plugin Manifest**: https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"42f6f426-b868-4787-9b6f-41c6b896d198","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:57:35.037Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP manifest.json plugin structure documentation official","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01UKPJYXBNCLECoR86WhMYQv","content":[{"title":"Manifest File Structure - UXP Manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/"},{"title":"The manifest.json file (v4)","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/manifest/"},{"title":"Plugin manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"The manifest.json file (v3)","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/manifest-v3/"},{"title":"UXP Manifest v5","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v5/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #13 Manifest v5 | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/Adobe-UXP-things-you-need-to-know-manifest-5.html"},{"title":"Manifest File Structure","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2021/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/"},{"title":"UXP Manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/1688653963277/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"Manifest for scripts and plugins","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/resources/fundamentals/manifest/"},{"title":"uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/ui-playground/plugin/manifest.json at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/blob/main/ui-playground/plugin/manifest.json"}]},"Based on the search results, here's the official Adobe UXP documentation for the manifest.json plugin structure:\n\n## Adobe UXP Manifest.json Documentation\n\n### Overview\nThe manifest is a JSON file that is located at the root of the plugin bundle.

This release represents a major step forward in modernizing Adobe's extensibility ecosystem.\n\n## Timeline of Development\n\n- On Dec 5th, 2024, Adobe opened their public beta for UXP Plugins in Premiere Pro. This moment has been long-awaited by Premiere plugin developers since UXP was originally announced by Adobe back in 2019.\n\n- UXP in Premiere Pro had been in a private beta phase for several months before that. The public beta launched in early December 2024, allowing developers to obtain the Premiere Pro beta and the latest version of UXP Developer Tool (UDT) from Creative Cloud Desktop app to start creating UXP plugins.\n\n## What is UXP?\n\nUXP is a modern extensibility platform for building custom tools and features that streamline workflows in Premiere. It is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications, powered by a modern JavaScript engine that offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)UXP is a JavaScript-based extensibility platform (ES6/ECMAScript 2015 compliant) that helps you automate, optimize, and extend the capabilities of your favorite Adobe Creative Cloud products.

UXP plugin panels will gradually replace CEP Extensions in Adobe apps on different timelines. Photoshop was the first app to fully adopt UXP, InDesign followed, and now Premiere Pro is the next candidate.(no content)UXP Plugins are JavaScript/HTML/CSS based, built on their own unique stack by Adobe which makes them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack. Instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has 1 unified environment for your frontend code and host API calls.(no content)CEP 12 shipped with Premiere Pro 25.0, and CEP 12 will be the last major update to CEP, although critical security issues will continue to be addressed.\n\n## Getting Started with Development\n\nTo get started, ensure you have Premiere v25.6 installed. You will also need the latest build, v2.2.1, of the UXP Developer Tools (UDT) to load, debug, and package your plugins.(no content)The UXP Developer Tool (UDT) simplifies the process of creating, loading, managing, and debugging plugins for Adobe's UXP-powered applications.

UXP is a lightweight JavaScript engine built directly into Adobe apps, ensuring faster load times and lower memory usage.\n- CEP uses a full version of Chromium as a web host. This is very resource intensive for the host application, even more so since each CEP plugin runs in its own instance of Chromium.\n- UXP provides a comprehensive extensibility solution, turning JavaScript and HTML markup into controls in native application windows. You can think of UXP as a small runtime with a subset of browser functionality that Adobe intends to grow.\n\n### Communication with Host Applications\n- CEP doesn't talk directly to the host application, but requires that host scripts be written in ExtendScript, and passed to the app via EvalScript calls. So there are two different JavaScript engines running. In practice, this means that a plugin's code is artificially split between ExtendScript and JavaScript, and passing anything more than simple parameters between the two layers is awkward and inefficient.\n- Because UXP communicates directly with the host application, the issues associated with the CEP/ExtendScript interface disappear. In general, plugin development is simpler with UXP.\n- A unified, modern execution environment (JavaScript V8) allows plugin UI and business logic to share the same context, which means no need to use evalScript anymore!\n\n### Performance & Security\n- UXP is optimized for performance, running natively and integrating more efficiently with Photoshop than CEP extensions. UXP extensions are sandboxed and isolated, providing a secure environment that minimizes the risk of interference between plug-ins.\n- CEP extensions can slow down Adobe applications, while UXP's streamlined architecture provides a more efficient runtime. UXP's sandboxed approach reduces the risk of vulnerabilities that can arise in the less isolated environment of CEP. UXP's compatibility with modern JavaScript features and React-based UI makes development faster and more accessible.\n\n### Development Experience\n- UXP comes with a plugin loader and debugger that makes managing plugin development much simpler than what's available in CEP. UXP plugins can use the Spectrum CSS components, which can be used to provide theme-aware cross-platform user interfaces that look the same across CC applications.\n- UXP leverages JavaScript with a React-like component system, allowing developers to create robust, responsive UI components without compromising performance.\n\n## Migration Considerations\n\nThere is no clear-cut path for migration, given that CEP and UXP are fundamentally different. CEP was based on CEF (Chromium Embedded Framework), making it effectively act as a browser.\n\n### Key Migration Steps\n- Rewrite HTML/CSS UI Components in React: UXP's UI framework is based on React, which requires updating your existing HTML/CSS components.\n- Refactor JavaScript Code: UXP supports modern JavaScript and ES6+ syntax, so you can update older JavaScript to a cleaner, more concise format.\n- Replace CEP's CSInterface API Calls: UXP has its own APIs that replace the CSInterface used in CEP, so migrating requires replacing old API calls with UXP equivalents. Adobe offers a migration guide to help developers adjust to the new platform.\n\n### M1 Mac Support\nCEP is natively supported on M1 devices for all applications except for Photoshop. You can continue to run CEP extensions natively on Windows and on M1 machines by running Photoshop in Rosetta mode. The missing M1 support for native Photoshop usage on M1 machines is a strong reason to start thinking about migrating existing CEP extensions to UXP plugins.\n\n## Current Status\n\nCEP will still function, but Adobe's focus on UXP means future updates and features will be exclusive to the new platform.(no content)CEP 12 shipped with Photoshop 25.12, Premiere Pro 25.0, and After Effects 25.0.

UXP is a lightweight JavaScript engine built directly into Adobe apps, ensuring faster load times and lower memory usage.\n- CEP uses a full version of Chromium as a web host. This is very resource intensive for the host application, even more so since each CEP plugin runs in its own instance of Chromium.\n- UXP provides a comprehensive extensibility solution, turning JavaScript and HTML markup into controls in native application windows. You can think of UXP as a small runtime with a subset of browser functionality that Adobe intends to grow.\n\n### Communication with Host Applications\n- CEP doesn't talk directly to the host application, but requires that host scripts be written in ExtendScript, and passed to the app via EvalScript calls. So there are two different JavaScript engines running. In practice, this means that a plugin's code is artificially split between ExtendScript and JavaScript, and passing anything more than simple parameters between the two layers is awkward and inefficient.\n- Because UXP communicates directly with the host application, the issues associated with the CEP/ExtendScript interface disappear.

In addition to core metadata such as the plugin's name, version, icons, and entry points, the manifest specifies permissions, compatibility details, and other definitions that shape how the plugin integrates with the host environment.(no content)Most importantly, it contains your plugin ID, which uniquely identifies your plugin when it's installed in the host application.\n\n### Manifest Version\n\nPremiere supports manifest version \"5\".\n\n### Entry Points Structure\n\nThe entrypoints array defines the entrypoints that the plugin provides; currently, only Commands and Panels are supported. Check the EntrypointDefinition section for more details.(no content)The entrypoints field is an array of objects matching the EntryPointDefinition format. These entries appear both in the Plugins menu in the native menubar, and the plugin panel. Each entry point specifies a type, to create either a direct-action command or a panel show/hide command.\n\n### Main Entry File\n\nThe main entry indicates the primary JavaScript or HTML file, relative to the plugin's installation directory. It supports HTML and JS files, such as index.html and index.js. If not specified (for deprecations), main.js is used.\n\n### Host Configuration\n\nOnly during development, for convenience, you can assign to the host property an array of HostDefinition objects, allowing the plugin to be loaded in multiple applications simultaneously.(no content)However, during submission to the marketplace, only one HostDefinition is allowed.\n\n### Auto-Start Plugins Example\n\nInvisible auto-start plugins are possible in Premiere Pro Beta 25.4 by adding the following entry to the manifest host object with `loadEvent: \"startup\"` in the data property, and the menu item can be disabled by leaving the manifest entrypoints object blank (`entrypoints: []`).\n\n### Icons\n\nAn array of icons represents the overall plugin or panel icon. The host application uses these icons to present the plugin to the user. If the icons array is missing, a default icon will be used.(no content)Icons support PNG (.png), JPG (.jpg or .jpeg), and SVG (.svg) files.\n\n### Permissions\n\nTo ensure that plugins are secure, UXP requires that plugins declare the permissions they need to function. Permissions not explicitly declared will be denied by default.\n\n### Current Status\n\nAs of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins.(no content)Building plugins requires Premiere (v25.6) or later and UXP Developer Tool (v2.2) or later.(no content)Note that Premiere doesn't support hybrid plugins (UXP plugins with C++ native libraries) yet.\n\nFor full documentation, visit the official Adobe developer documentation at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"d77bcfe2-6017-4c16-8c9a-d33f9fcf10bf","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:59:04.196Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro UXP plugin manifest.json entry points structure 2024 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01RihcZuhBoPa8iDrjcvB5aj","content":[{"title":"Plugin manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"},{"title":"Manifest File Structure - UXP Manifest","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v4/"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Plugin concepts","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/"},{"title":"The manifest.json file (v4)","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/plugin-structure/manifest/"},{"title":"Building your first UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"Invisible Auto-Start UXP Plugins for Premiere Pro - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/invisible-auto-start-uxp-plugins-for-premiere-pro/10835"},{"title":"Get started - UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/getting-started/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's the information about Premiere Pro UXP plugin manifest.json entry points structure:\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP Plugin Manifest.json Entry Points Structure\n\n### Overview\n\nEach UXP plugin must have one manifest.json file that the host application uses to load and manage the plugin.

This brings up a window that resembles the Chrome debugger where you can look at the console log, and do the usual debugger things such as setting breakpoints, stepping into and out of functions, etc.(no content)If you just want to look at logs without dealing with the debugger, you can choose the Logs option in the Actions menu.\n\n## Watch and Reload\n\nThe plugin will be loaded in Premiere, and UDT will watch for changes in the plugin's source code and reload it automatically.(no content)If you make any changes to the manifest.json file, you must manually unload and reload the plugin. In the UXP Developer Tool, in the row for your plugin, click Unload and then Load & Watch once more.\n\n## Additional Features\n\n- UDT includes a Code Playground to quickly test and explore APIs and lets you package plugins into a .ccx installable file, ready for distribution.\n- Click the gear icon to open the preferences panel and update the UDT Theme (Dark or Light), toggle Auto Scroll Logs, or change the Service Port that UDT uses to communicate with host applications.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4cccaebf-2dc1-4e76-912b-088536ee7a47","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:59:40.431Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP Developer Tool UDT setup install debug Premiere Pro plugin","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01G3kjwm6gvQLM1mmVEx3ssP","content":[{"title":"Essential Development Tools for UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP Developer Tool plugin development","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/tutorials/udt-deep-dive/"},{"title":"Get started - UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/getting-started/"},{"title":"Building your first UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development"},{"title":"UXP developer tools","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/"},{"title":"UXP Developer Tool (UDT) Walkthrough guide","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/devtool/udt-walkthrough/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP Developer Tool","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/devtool/"},{"title":"GitHub - adobe-uxp/devtools-cli: CLI for UXP developer tools, including creating, loading and debugging plugins.","url":"https://github.com/adobe-uxp/devtools-cli"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about setting up the Adobe UXP Developer Tool (UDT) for debugging Premiere Pro plugins:\n\n## Overview\n\nThe UXP Developer Tool (UDT) simplifies the process of creating, loading, managing, and debugging plugins for Adobe's UXP-powered applications.(no content)UXP plugins are supported in Premiere v25.6 and later since UDT v2.2.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe UXP Developer Tool requires administrator-level privileges to run correctly.(no content)If you cannot elevate permissions on your system, you may not be able to use this tool.\n\nTo install UDT:\n- You can download the UDT through Creative Cloud Desktop.\n- Click on the All apps section, and you should see \"UXP Developer Tools\" listed.

Though it allows you to use the same syntax, it does not intend to behave like a browser and consequently supports only a subset of the web APIs. This means not all the HTML Elements or CSS classes or JavaScript APIs will be available in the UXP world.\n\n### Unified Architecture Components\n\nUXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment, and you just need to require() the appropriate modules to access the APIs you need.\n\n### Two Main API Types\n\n1. **UXP Core APIs**: For building user interfaces, file operations, network calls, and general functionality. These provide the fundamental building blocks for plugin functionality, and are shared across all Adobe Creative Cloud applications that support UXP.\n\n2. **Premiere APIs**: For interacting with and modifying Premiere projects and sequences.\n\n### Runtime Behavior\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### Additional Components\n\n- File system, networking, shell execution, and core UXP functionality are available, along with Adobe's design system components for building plugin interfaces.\n- UXP supports certain HTML elements and CSS properties.\n- Frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte can be used optionally with UXP.\n\n### Version Information\n\nEach Premiere release integrates a specific UXP version. For example, Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.(no content)The Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP) has officially graduated from beta and is now available in Adobe Premiere 25.6, representing a major step forward in modernizing the extensibility ecosystem.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"9bbc6372-c9cc-4453-88a2-a9d8ec54e354","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:00:16.413Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe Premiere Pro UXP architecture diagram components runtime JavaScript engine","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_015adwDht7GggABKQuFR9e6T","content":[{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Prerequisites for UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/tech-stack/"},{"title":"Premiere and UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"Building your first UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/"},{"title":"UXP - Now Available in Premiere Pro Beta! - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-now-available-in-premiere-pro-beta/8795"},{"title":"Scripting Changes in Adobe’s Video Applications | by Bruce Bullis | Adobe Tech Blog | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/adobetech/scripting-changes-in-adobes-video-applications-1bee1fc0fe47"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about Adobe Premiere Pro's UXP architecture, components, runtime, and JavaScript engine:\n\n## UXP Architecture Overview\n\nUXP is a JavaScript-based extensibility platform (ES6/ECMAScript 2015 compliant) that helps automate, optimize, and extend the capabilities of Adobe Creative Cloud products.\n\n### JavaScript Engine\n\nUXP is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)Adobe describes it as \"JavaScript, executed in an engine over 25 years newer than the ExtendScript engine.\"(no content)UXP is not a full-blown browser or server-side JS engine like NodeJS.

This release represents a major step forward in modernizing Adobe's extensibility ecosystem.(no content)To get started, you need Premiere (v25.6) or later and the UXP Developer Tool (v2.2) or later.\n\n### Plugin Architecture\nA UXP plugin is a self-contained application hosted in Premiere. Every plugin is built using one or both of two component types: Panels and Commands.(no content)Commands are actions, while Panels are workspaces. Commands execute tasks and close; Panels provide ongoing interfaces that stay open alongside Premiere's built-in panels.(no content)Panels are persistent user interfaces that users can dock into the Premiere workspace alongside built-in panels like the Timeline or Effect Controls. They remain open and interactive throughout the work session.\n\n### Spectrum UI Framework Options\nAdobe Spectrum Web Components (popularly known as SWC) is an open-source library that has Spectrum-styled web components.(no content)Spectrum UXP is designed to mimic HTML5 Web Components. This allows UXP to expose a consistent yet custom user interface without requiring a specific framework (such as React or Vue) while still encapsulating the implementation details.\n\nThere are three UI options available:\n\n1. **HTML Elements** - UXP is not a browser. It's a platform that provides the ease of using web technologies to build plugins/scripts for desktop applications. Hence, it does not support all the HTML/CSS capabilities you can use in a browser.\n\n2. **Spectrum UXP Widgets** - These are built-in within UXP. Therefore, they may appear to be a black-box solution that does not allow you to peek into the details during debugging or alter their behavior easily.\n\n3. **UXP Spectrum Web Components** - These are the Adobe Spectrum Web Components, supported from UXP v7.0 onwards. It's built using Web Components technology. In order to use them, you are required to install the components individually and then import them before using the component tag.(no content)The support for SWC in UXP is more extensive. It has 30 components including some unique ones that are not available in Spectrum widgets such as table, toast, card, etc.\n\n### Recommendations\nThe choice you make depends on your use case and the stage of development you are in. If you are looking for a ready-made Adobe Spectrum-styled UI or are just getting started with programming your UI, they recommend you start your journey with SWC. Fall back to Spectrum UXP widgets for variants in the comps that are not available yet. And use plain HTML elements when they are not available in either.\n\n### Third-Party Tools\nYou can use native Spectrum UXP widgets without any extra dependencies, however you will receive TypeScript errors.

This can include intrinsic transformations, as well as video and audio effects.\n\n- **Duration**: The duration of the trackItem is a Time object (read-only).\n\n- **Start/End Times**: The visible start time of the trackItem in the sequence is relative to the beginning of its corresponding sequence (NOT the sequence zero point). Note: This may differ from the trackItem's in point, which is relative to the source. Time object, read/write.\n\n- **Type**: The type of media provided by this trackItem - Number, 1 means video, 2 means audio.\n\n- **Methods**: getSpeed() returns the speed multiplier applied to the TrackItem as a Float (no speed adjustment = 1). isAdjustmentLayer() returns whether the TrackItem is an adjustment layer.\n\n## Sequence API\n\nThe Sequence object has methods like `insertClip(projectItem, time, vTrackIndex, aTrackIndex)` which inserts a clip into the sequence on the specified video and audio tracks at the specified time.

This can include intrinsic transformations, as well as video and audio effects.\n\n- **Duration**: The duration of the trackItem is a Time object (read-only).\n\n- **Start/End Times**: The visible start time of the trackItem in the sequence is relative to the beginning of its corresponding sequence (NOT the sequence zero point). Note: This may differ from the trackItem's in point, which is relative to the source. Time object, read/write.\n\n- **Type**: The type of media provided by this trackItem - Number, 1 means video, 2 means audio.\n\n- **Methods**: getSpeed() returns the speed multiplier applied to the TrackItem as a Float (no speed adjustment = 1). isAdjustmentLayer() returns whether the TrackItem is an adjustment layer.\n\n## Sequence API\n\nThe Sequence object has methods like `insertClip(projectItem, time, vTrackIndex, aTrackIndex)` which inserts a clip into the sequence on the specified video and audio tracks at the specified time. Returns a boolean; true if successful.\n\n## UXP-Specific Usage\n\nFor the UXP environment, to access trackItems inside of a track using the available trackItem API, you will need input parameters: trackItemType and includeEmptyTrackItem for getTrackItems API.

What is UXP and How Does It Differ from CEP?\n\n### UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform)\nUXP is a JavaScript-based extensibility platform (ES6/ECMAScript 2015 compliant) that provides direct access to Adobe Creative Cloud applications. It is built on a modern JavaScript V8 engine that is over 25 years newer than the ExtendScript engine.\n\n### Key Differences from CEP\n\n| Aspect | CEP (Common Extensibility Platform) | UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform) |\n|--------|--------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|\n| **Architecture** | Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) - resource intensive, each plugin runs in its own Chromium instance | Lightweight JavaScript engine built directly into Adobe apps |\n| **JavaScript Engines** | Two separate engines: Chromium JS for UI + ExtendScript for host communication | Single unified V8 JavaScript environment |\n| **Host Communication** | Indirect via CSInterface and evalScript() calls passing messages between runtimes | Direct native access to host application APIs |\n| **Performance** | High memory usage, slower load times | Faster load times, lower memory footprint |\n| **Execution Model** | Synchronous (blocks UI during execution) | Asynchronous (non-blocking, does not freeze Premiere UI) |\n| **Security** | Less isolated environment | Sandboxed and isolated plugin environment |\n| **Status** | CEP 12 is the final major version (shipped with Premiere Pro 25.0) | Active development, now GA in Premiere Pro 25.6 |\n\n### CEP Deprecation Timeline\n- CEP 12 will continue to receive critical security updates only\n- ExtendScript-based integrations will remain supported through September 2026\n- UXP is the exclusive path forward for new plugin development\n\n---\n\n## 2. How UXP Works in Premiere Pro Context\n\n### Runtime Architecture\n\n```\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n|                    Premiere Pro Application              |\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n|                                                          |\n|  +----------------------------------------------------+  |\n|  |              UXP Runtime (V8 Engine)               |  |\n|  |                                                    |  |\n|  |  +----------------+    +------------------------+  |  |\n|  |  |  UXP Core APIs |    |  Premiere DOM APIs     |  |  |\n|  |  |  - File System |    |  - Project             |  |  |\n|  |  |  - Network     |    |  - Sequence            |  |  |\n|  |  |  - UI/Spectrum |    |  - Tracks              |  |  |\n|  |  |  - Shell       |    |  - TrackItems          |  |  |\n|  |  +----------------+    |  - Markers             |  |  |\n|  |                        |  - Effects             |  |  |\n|  |                        +------------------------+  |  |\n|  +----------------------------------------------------+  |\n|                           |                              |\n|                           v                              |\n|  +----------------------------------------------------+  |\n|  |                  Your UXP Plugin                   |  |\n|  |   (JavaScript + HTML + CSS + manifest.json)        |  |\n|  +----------------------------------------------------+  |\n+----------------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n### Key Architectural Principles\n\n1. **Unified Environment**: Plugin UI code and business logic run in the same JavaScript context - no need for evalScript() bridges\n\n2. **Asynchronous by Default**: All Premiere API method calls are asynchronous and return Promises, preventing UI thread blocking. However, property getters/setters are synchronous for convenience.\n\n3. **Module-Based Access**: APIs are accessed via `require()`:\n   ```javascript\n   const ppro = require(\"premierepro\");\n   ```\n\n4. **Version Binding**: Premiere Pro 25.6 includes UXP v8.1\n\n---\n\n## 3. Core Components of a UXP Plugin\n\n### Required File Structure\n\n```\nmy-plugin/\n├── manifest.json          # Plugin metadata and configuration (REQUIRED)\n├── index.html             # Main UI entry point (for panels)\n├── index.js               # Main JavaScript entry point\n├── icons/                 # Plugin icons\n│   ├── icon-light.png     # Light theme icon\n│   └── icon-dark.png      # Dark theme icon\n├── types.d.ts             # TypeScript definitions (optional)\n└── package.json           # NPM dependencies (if using build tools)\n```\n\n### manifest.json Structure\n\nThe manifest is the critical configuration file. Premiere Pro supports **manifest version 5**.\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"com.mycompany.myplugin\",\n  \"name\": \"My Plugin Name\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"premierepro\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"25.6.0\"\n  },\n  \"entrypoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"mainPanel\",\n      \"label\": \"My Panel\",\n      \"minimumSize\": { \"width\": 300, \"height\": 400 },\n      \"maximumSize\": { \"width\": 800, \"height\": 1200 },\n      \"preferredDockedSize\": { \"width\": 300, \"height\": 400 },\n      \"preferredFloatingSize\": { \"width\": 400, \"height\": 500 }\n    },\n    {\n      \"type\": \"command\",\n      \"id\": \"runCommand\",\n      \"label\": \"Execute Action\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"icons\": [\n    { \"width\": 24, \"height\": 24, \"path\": \"icons/icon-light.png\", \"theme\": [\"light\"] },\n    { \"width\": 24, \"height\": 24, \"path\": \"icons/icon-dark.png\", \"theme\": [\"dark\"] }\n  ],\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"localFileSystem\": \"fullAccess\",\n    \"network\": { \"domains\": [\"https://api.myservice.com\"] },\n    \"clipboard\": \"readAndWrite\",\n    \"allowCodeGenerationFromStrings\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Entry Point Types\n\n1. **Panels**: Persistent UI workspaces that dock into Premiere's interface\n   - Remain open throughout the work session\n   - Can be docked, floated, or tabbed\n   - Defined with size constraints\n\n2. **Commands**: One-shot actions executed from the Plugins menu\n   - Execute a task and close immediately\n   - No persistent UI\n\n### Auto-Start Plugins\n\nFor invisible background plugins that start automatically:\n```json\n{\n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"premierepro\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"25.6.0\",\n    \"data\": {\n      \"loadEvent\": \"startup\"\n    }\n  },\n  \"entrypoints\": []\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. APIs Exposed for Premiere Pro\n\n### API Categories\n\nUXP provides two main API layers:\n\n#### A. UXP Core APIs (Cross-Application)\n- **File System**: Read/write files on disk\n- **Network**: HTTP/HTTPS requests, WebSockets\n- **Shell**: Open URLs, execute system commands\n- **Clipboard**: Read/write clipboard data\n- **OS Information**: Platform detection\n\n#### B. Premiere DOM APIs (Application-Specific)\n\nAccess via: `const ppro = require(\"premierepro\");`\n\n**Key Classes and Their Purposes:**\n\n| Class | Purpose |\n|-------|---------|\n| `Project` | Create, open, save, close projects |\n| `ProjectItem` / `ClipProjectItem` / `FolderItem` | Manage media assets in Project panel |\n| `Sequence` | Timeline/sequence operations |\n| `SequenceEditor` | Advanced timeline editing |\n| `VideoTrack` / `AudioTrack` / `CaptionTrack` | Track management |\n| `VideoClipTrackItem` / `AudioClipTrackItem` | Individual clips on timeline |\n| `Markers` | Create, modify, delete markers |\n| `Metadata` | Read/write XMP metadata |\n| `VideoFilterFactory` / `AudioFilterFactory` | Apply effects |\n| `TransitionFactory` | Apply transitions |\n| `TickTime` | Time calculations and representation |\n| `EventManager` | Subscribe to application events |\n\n**Constants Namespace** (`ppro.Constants`):\n- `MediaType`, `ContentType`, `TrackItemType`\n- `ProjectItemColorLabel` (15 color options)\n- `VideoDisplayFormatType`, `AudioChannelType`\n- `InterpolationMode`, `TransitionPosition`\n- Event type constants\n\n**Example API Usage:**\n```javascript\nconst ppro = require(\"premierepro\");\n\n// Get the active project\nconst project = await ppro.Project.getActiveProject();\n\n// Get sequences\nconst sequences = await project.getSequences();\n\n// Work with tracks\nconst videoTracks = await sequences[0].getVideoTracks();\nconst trackItems = await videoTracks[0].getTrackItems(\n  ppro.Constants.TrackItemType.CLIP, \n  false\n);\n\n// Get markers\nconst markers = await ppro.Markers.getMarkers(sequences[0]);\n```\n\n### Current API Limitations\n- No razor tool equivalent API\n- Cannot move clips vertically between tracks\n- Caption API is still under construction\n- Hybrid plugins (UXP + C++ native libraries) not yet supported\n\n---\n\n## 5. System Requirements and Setup\n\n### Version Requirements\n\n| Component | Minimum Version |\n|-----------|-----------------|\n| **Premiere Pro** | v25.6 or later |\n| **UXP Developer Tool (UDT)** | v2.2.1 or later |\n| **UXP Runtime** | v8.1 (included in Premiere 25.6) |\n| **Manifest Version** | 5 |\n\n### Development Environment Setup\n\n1. **Install Premiere Pro 25.6+** via Creative Cloud Desktop\n\n2. **Install UXP Developer Tool (UDT)**\n   - Available in Creative Cloud Desktop under \"All Apps\"\n   - Requires administrator privileges\n   - Used for loading, debugging, and packaging plugins\n\n3. **Enable Developer Mode**\n   - Must be enabled in both UDT and Premiere Pro\n   - UDT connects to running Premiere Pro instances\n\n### Development Workflow\n\n1. **Create Plugin**: Use UDT \"Create Plugin\" to scaffold a new project\n2. **Load Plugin**: UDT loads plugin into running Premiere Pro\n3. **Watch Mode**: UDT watches for file changes and auto-reloads\n4. **Debug**: Chrome-like debugger for breakpoints, console, inspection\n5. **Package**: Export as `.ccx` file for distribution\n\n**Important**: Changes to `manifest.json` require manual unload/reload.\n\n### UI Framework Options\n\n1. **HTML Elements**: Basic HTML/CSS (subset of browser capabilities)\n2. **Spectrum UXP Widgets**: Built-in Adobe design system components\n3. **Spectrum Web Components (SWC)**: Adobe's open-source component library (30+ components, requires npm install)\n\nFrameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte are optionally supported with appropriate build tooling.\n\n### Distribution\n\n- Packaged plugins (`.ccx` files) can be submitted to Adobe Marketplace\n- Must reduce `host` array to single HostDefinition for marketplace submission\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nUXP represents a fundamental modernization of Adobe's plugin architecture for Premiere Pro. Key takeaways:\n\n- **Single unified JavaScript environment** with direct API access (no evalScript bridge)\n- **Asynchronous, non-blocking operations** that keep Premiere Pro responsive\n- **Manifest v5** configuration with declarative permissions model\n- **Two entry point types**: Panels (persistent UI) and Commands (one-shot actions)\n- **Comprehensive Premiere DOM API** for projects, sequences, tracks, clips, markers, and effects\n- **Requires Premiere Pro 25.6+** and UDT 2.2.1+ for development\n- **Active development** with ongoing API additions (some features like caption editing still in progress)\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n- [The Premiere UXP API - Official Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Premiere and UXP Introduction](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/)\n- [Plugin Manifest Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/)\n- [Premiere API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [Understanding UXP APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/)\n- [Essential Development Tools for UXP](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/)\n- [UXP Developer Tool Deep Dive](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/tutorials/udt-deep-dive/)\n- [Spectrum UXP Widgets](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/Spectrum%20UXP%20Widgets/)\n- [Panels and Commands](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/panels-and-commands/)\n- [GitHub: UXP Premiere Pro Samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [GitHub: UXP Premiere Pro Types Definition](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)\n- [Markers Class Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/markers/)\n- [UXP for CEP Developers Migration Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_for_you/uxp_for_cep_devs/)\n- [CEP to UXP Migration Guide](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/UXP-Migration-Guide)\n- [Why Migrating to Adobe UXP Now Is Critical](https://medium.com/@azaikin/migration-from-adobe-cep-to-uxp-57ef6b629386)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP Beta - Hyper Brew](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/)\n- [Bolt UXP - Boilerplate for UXP Plugins](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":451,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1702,"cache_read_input_tokens":24325,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1702,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":3,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGeAKcShk6XRBFkGJGxs","type":"assistant","uuid":"63acab2e-13b8-4d03-a9a4-2f7cca23eff4","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:02:46.633Z"}
