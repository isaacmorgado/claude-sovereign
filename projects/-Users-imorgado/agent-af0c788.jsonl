Only one expert is activated per token, maintaining efficiency.\n\n**Available Models on HuggingFace:**\n- Both Scout and Maverick come with BF16 weights. Additionally, Maverick also comes with the FP8-quantized version on Day 0.\n- The model can be deployed efficiently on vLLM, Red Hat Enterprise Linux AI, and OpenShift AI.\n\n**Hardware Requirements:**\n- Using 8xH100, vLLM can serve Scout with 1M context and Maverick with about 430K.\n- The FP8-quantized version of Llama 4 Maverick 128E enables the 128 expert model to fit on a single NVIDIA 8xH100 node, resulting in more performance with lower costs.\n\n**Sample vLLM Command:**\n```bash\nvllm serve meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8 \\\n  --tensor-parallel-size 8 \\\n  --max-model-len 430000\n```\n\nSetting `--kv-cache-dtype fp8` can potentially double the usable context window and provide a performance boost.\n\n**Multimodal Support:**\n- The Llama 4 models excel at image understanding up to 8-10 images. By default, vLLM server accepts 1 image per request.

What is Llama 4 Maverick? Is it officially released?\n\n**Yes, Llama 4 Maverick is officially released.** It was launched by Meta on **April 5, 2025** under the Llama 4 Community License Agreement.\n\nLlama 4 Maverick is a natively multimodal AI model that uses a **Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture**. It is part of the Llama 4 family alongside Scout (smaller) and the upcoming Behemoth (larger). Maverick is described as Meta's main workhorse model, used in their apps like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Context Window Size\n\n- **Maximum context length: Up to 1 million tokens** (for the Instruct version)\n- Pre-training context length: 256K tokens\n- Actual available context varies by provider:\n  - Oracle Cloud: 512K tokens\n  - Groq: 128K tokens\n  - SambaNova: 64K tokens\n  - vLLM on 8xH100: ~430K tokens\n\n---\n\n## 3. Model Sizes and VRAM Requirements\n\n| Specification | Value |\n|--------------|-------|\n| **Active Parameters** | 17 billion per token |\n| **Total Parameters** | ~400 billion (402B) |\n| **Number of Experts** | 128 |\n\n**VRAM Requirements:**\n\n| Precision | VRAM Required |\n|-----------|---------------|\n| Full BF16/FP16 | ~800 GB+ |\n| FP8 Quantized | Fits on single 8xH100 node (~640 GB) |\n| INT4/Q4_K_M Quantized | ~122-243 GB |\n\nThe entire 400B parameter model must be loaded into memory even though only 17B active parameters are used per token.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Available on HuggingFace?\n\n**Yes.** Multiple versions are available:\n\n- [meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct) - Official BF16\n- [meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8) - Official FP8 quantized\n- [unsloth/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-GGUF) - GGUF format for llama.cpp\n- [nvidia/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8) - NVIDIA FP8 version\n\n---\n\n## 5. Abliterated/Uncensored Version?\n\n**No specific abliterated version found for Llama 4 Maverick.** My search did not reveal a publicly available uncensored/abliterated variant. The base model (non-Instruct) is available at [meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E) which has fewer safety alignments than the Instruct version, but is not specifically abliterated. Community-created uncensored versions may appear over time on HuggingFace.\n\n---\n\n## 6. Compatible with vLLM?\n\n**Yes, fully compatible with vLLM v0.8.3+**\n\nExample deployment command:\n```bash\nvllm serve meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-FP8 \\\n  --tensor-parallel-size 8 \\\n  --max-model-len 430000\n```\n\nAdding `--kv-cache-dtype fp8` can potentially double the usable context window.\n\nFor multimodal (image) support, add `--limit-mm-per-prompt image=10` to handle up to 10 images per request.\n\n---\n\n## 7. GPUs Needed to Run It\n\n| Configuration | Hardware Required |\n|--------------|-------------------|\n| **FP8 (Recommended)** | Single 8xH100 DGX node (640 GB total VRAM) |\n| **BF16 Full Precision** | Multiple 8xH100 nodes |\n| **Quantized (Q4/INT4)** | 2x RTX 4090 (48 GB) or equivalent |\n| **Consumer Local** | Very challenging; requires heavy quantization |\n\nMeta's official recommendation is an **NVIDIA H100 DGX system or equivalent** for production deployment.\n\n---\n\n## Sources:\n- [Meta AI Blog - Llama 4 Announcement](https://ai.meta.com/blog/llama-4-multimodal-intelligence/)\n- [HuggingFace - Llama 4 Release Blog](https://huggingface.co/blog/llama4-release)\n- [vLLM Blog - Llama 4 Support](https://blog.vllm.ai/2025/04/05/llama4.html)\n- [HuggingFace - Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct)\n- [Unsloth - Llama 4 GGUF](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Llama-4-Maverick-17B-128E-Instruct-GGUF)\n- [RunPod Blog - Llama 4 Analysis](https://www.runpod.io/blog/llama4-scout-maverick)\n- [APXML - Llama 4 GPU Requirements](https://apxml.com/posts/llama-4-system-requirements)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4268,"cache_read_input_tokens":22036,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4268,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWpxxfhg2TdaBB6i162NV","type":"assistant","uuid":"465b94d4-e8d1-45cd-99bb-563275ab67d8","timestamp":"2026-01-05T21:47:28.164Z"}
