The single global object is always available by its name, `app`.\n\n### Sequence Properties\nAn array of audio Track objects in the sequence is available as a TrackCollection object (read-only). The sequence also includes:\n- The time, in ticks, of the end of the sequence (String; read-only)\n- The horizontal frame size, or width, of the sequence. Set this attribute with the Sequence.setSettings() method (Integer; read-only)\n\n### Working with Tracks and Clips\nYou can get the first clip in the timeline on video track 1 by using the `qe.project.getActiveSequence().getVideoTrackAt(0).getItemAt(0)` function. This returns the first item of the first video track in the active sequence.\n\n### QE DOM vs Regular DOM\nOfficially, the QE DOM is not recommended, or supported. The QE DOM has some issues updating itself, in response to user interaction.(no content)There's no way to call getItemAt(x) that'll ignore empties; that's up to you. trackItems in the regular (non-QE) DOM have an isSelected() method.\n\n### Track Methods\nWhen using insertClip/overwriteClip, it doesn't seem to matter whether you choose the target sequence's videoTracks or audioTracks. Executing insertClip/overwriteClip always carries all picture and sound tracks from source clip to sequence.(no content)It does matter which track layer is chosen. Choosing videoTracks[0] or audioTracks[0] means a source clip with 1 picture track and 2 sound tracks will route to V1 and A1 / A2 on the record side.

Instead, you would adjust the duration of the existing trackItem, then insert a new trackItem, representing the remaining portion of the original trackItem.\n\n### QE DOM Razor Method (Unsupported)\nQE DOM has razor(string, bool, bool) method on sequence and track objects, but this is part of the unsupported QE DOM. You can accomplish that, without using the (unsupported, unrecommended) QE DOM.\n\nThere's a code example showing the QE DOM approach:\nYou can apply the cut to all audio tracks using a loop that gets each audio track and calls `audioTrack.razor(timecodeString, true)`.\n\n### Recommended Workaround\nYou would create a new trackItem using everything you know (source projectItem, speed changes, footage reinterpretation) about the trackItem you're \"cutting\" (truncating).\n\nThe workaround involves:\n1. Adjusting the end point of the original clip\n2. Inserting a new clip representing the remaining portion\n\n### API Documentation Resources\nThis reference is a public compendium of information about the methods and members available via the ExtendScript API.

Instead, you would adjust the duration of the existing trackItem, then insert a new trackItem, representing the remaining portion of the original trackItem.\n\n### QE DOM Razor Method (Unsupported)\nQE DOM has razor(string, bool, bool) method on sequence and track objects, but this is part of the unsupported QE DOM. You can accomplish that, without using the (unsupported, unrecommended) QE DOM.\n\nThere's a code example showing the QE DOM approach:\nYou can apply the cut to all audio tracks using a loop that gets each audio track and calls `audioTrack.razor(timecodeString, true)`.\n\n### Recommended Workaround\nYou would create a new trackItem using everything you know (source projectItem, speed changes, footage reinterpretation) about the trackItem you're \"cutting\" (truncating).\n\nThe workaround involves:\n1. Adjusting the end point of the original clip\n2. Inserting a new clip representing the remaining portion\n\n### API Documentation Resources\nThis reference is a public compendium of information about the methods and members available via the ExtendScript API.

Another workaround is adjusting inPoint, outPoint, start and end, but it is a bit tricky: clip's inPoint and outPoint work in a strange nonobvious way, so make tests first.\n\n## Working Code Example\n\nTo adjust clip end points:\n```javascript\nvar myClip = app.project.sequences[0].videoTracks[0].clips[0];\nif (myClip){\n    var oldEnd = myClip.end;\n    if (oldEnd){\n        oldEnd.seconds = oldEnd.seconds + 3;\n        myClip.end = oldEnd;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## For ProjectItems (Not TrackItems)\n\nsetInPoint() and setOutPoint() work on project items in CC 2019, but not in CC 2017 (it appears setInPoint() and setOutPoint() don't exist for a project item in CC 2017).(no content)When using projectItem.setInPoint(seconds) and projectItem.setOutPoint(seconds), about 50% of the time the I/O points (in the source window) are set with a 1 frame error.\n\n## Sequence In/Out Points\n\nFor sequences, you can use `setInPoint()` and `setOutPoint()` directly on the sequence object, as shown in the nesting examples from the documentation and sample code.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8ef0bb11-4347-4044-b5b9-81386a5e4946","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:58:22.108Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro ExtendScript TrackItem setInPoint setOutPoint trim clip","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01JCsjEhVYbGvTH7QQvF1DXy","content":[{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Solved: Editing clips with ExtendScript - Adobe Product Community - 9056625","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/editing-clips-with-extendscript/td-p/9056625"},{"title":"Samples/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx at master · Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx"},{"title":"Sequence object - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/sequence/sequence/"},{"title":"Scripting bug when setInPoint and setOutPoint? - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/scripting-bug-when-setinpoint-and-setoutpointae/"},{"title":"How to Nest a Sequence using ExtendScript in Premiere Pro","url":"https://vakago-tools.com/how-to-nest-a-sequence-using-extendscript-in-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting: Set In and Out Points of Clip","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/premiere-pro-scripting-set-in-and-out-points-of-clip/m-p/10490225"},{"title":"Solved: Perform a cut from script? - Adobe Product Community - 11389974","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/perform-a-cut-from-script/td-p/11389974"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Scripting ExtendScript question - Adobe Product Community - 13379442","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-extendscript-question/td-p/13379442"},{"title":"Solved: Selected clip in timeline? - Adobe Product Community - 8233928","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/selected-clip-in-timeline/td-p/8233928"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about working with TrackItem in/out points and trimming clips in Premiere Pro ExtendScript:\n\n## TrackItem Properties for Trimming\n\nThe TrackItem object represents an item on a video or audio track, within a Sequence object.\n\n### Key Properties:\n\n**inPoint and outPoint (source-relative):**\n- The in point set on the source for this trackItem instance, relative to the beginning of the source.

Another workaround is adjusting inPoint, outPoint, start and end, but it is a bit tricky: clip's inPoint and outPoint work in a strange nonobvious way, so make tests first.\n\n## Working Code Example\n\nTo adjust clip end points:\n```javascript\nvar myClip = app.project.sequences[0].videoTracks[0].clips[0];\nif (myClip){\n    var oldEnd = myClip.end;\n    if (oldEnd){\n        oldEnd.seconds = oldEnd.seconds + 3;\n        myClip.end = oldEnd;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## For ProjectItems (Not TrackItems)\n\nsetInPoint() and setOutPoint() work on project items in CC 2019, but not in CC 2017 (it appears setInPoint() and setOutPoint() don't exist for a project item in CC 2017).(no content)When using projectItem.setInPoint(seconds) and projectItem.setOutPoint(seconds), about 50% of the time the I/O points (in the source window) are set with a 1 frame error.\n\n## Sequence In/Out Points\n\nFor sequences, you can use `setInPoint()` and `setOutPoint()` directly on the sequence object, as shown in the nesting examples from the documentation and sample code."],"durationSeconds":23.195468208000005}}

Here's what I found:\n\n## ExtendScript Code Examples for `qe.project.getActiveSequence()` with Razor and Timecode\n\n### Basic Razor Cut Example\n\nAfter a long time of searching, users discovered it was about calling the RAZOR method. Here is sample working code that enables the Quality Engineering library, gets the active QE sequence, and uses the CTI (Current Time Indicator) timecode in the format \"00:00:03:38\" for the razor operation.\n\n```javascript\n// Enable Quality Engineering library\napp.enableQE();\n\n// Get the active QE sequence\nvar sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence();\n\n// Get the playertime in timecode format (e.g., \"00:00:03:38\")\nvar playerTime = sqe.CTI.timecode;\n\n// QE has a razor method that can be called on a sequence object\n// Cut only on a specific track\nsqe.getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(playerTime);\n```\n\n### Full Razor Example with Timecode Conversion\n\nA more comprehensive example shows how to convert marker time to the \"HH:MM:SS:FF\" format and apply the razor to all video and audio tracks:\n\n```javascript\nfunction addCutAtMarker(marker) {\n    var sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence();\n    var timecode = marker.start.seconds;\n    \n    // Convert to \"HH:MM:SS:FF\" format\n    var hours = Math.floor(timecode / 3600);\n    var minutes = Math.floor((timecode - (hours * 3600)) / 60);\n    var seconds = Math.floor(timecode - (hours * 3600) - (minutes * 60));\n    var frames = Math.floor((timecode - Math.floor(timecode)) * 24); // Assuming 24 fps\n    var timecodeString = padNumber(hours, 2) + \":\" + padNumber(minutes, 2) + \":\" + padNumber(seconds, 2) + \":\" + padNumber(frames, 2);\n    \n    // Apply cut to all video tracks\n    for (var i = 0; i < sqe.numVideoTracks; i++) {\n        var videoTrack = sqe.getVideoTrackAt(i);\n        videoTrack.razor(timecodeString, true);\n    }\n    \n    // Apply cut to all audio tracks\n    for (var i = 0; i < sqe.numAudioTracks; i++) {\n        var audioTrack = sqe.getAudioTrackAt(i);\n        audioTrack.razor(timecodeString, true);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Using Time Object Formatting (from pymiere/ExtendScript)\n\nThe razor method requires a string timecode argument specifying when to cut the sequence. You can format a Time object to a timecode string using the sequence's video frame rate and display format settings.\n\n### Available CTI Properties\n\nThe active sequence's CTI (Current Time Indicator) provides multiple formats: `activeSequence.CTI.secs` for seconds, `activeSequence.CTI.frames` for frames, `activeSequence.CTI.ticks` for ticks, and `activeSequence.CTI.timecode` for the string timecode format.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nThe PPro ExtendScript QE DOM is officially unsupported and undocumented, with no additional work planned on it.(no content)There's no cut function in the standard ExtendScript API.

Here is sample working code that enables the Quality Engineering library, gets the active QE sequence, and uses the CTI (Current Time Indicator) timecode in the format \"00:00:03:38\" for the razor operation.\n\n```javascript\n// Enable Quality Engineering library\napp.enableQE();\n\n// Get the active QE sequence\nvar sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence();\n\n// Get the playertime in timecode format (e.g., \"00:00:03:38\")\nvar playerTime = sqe.CTI.timecode;\n\n// QE has a razor method that can be called on a sequence object\n// Cut only on a specific track\nsqe.getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(playerTime);\n```\n\n### Full Razor Example with Timecode Conversion\n\nA more comprehensive example shows how to convert marker time to the \"HH:MM:SS:FF\" format and apply the razor to all video and audio tracks:\n\n```javascript\nfunction addCutAtMarker(marker) {\n    var sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence();\n    var timecode = marker.start.seconds;\n    \n    // Convert to \"HH:MM:SS:FF\" format\n    var hours = Math.floor(timecode / 3600);\n    var minutes = Math.floor((timecode - (hours * 3600)) / 60);\n    var seconds = Math.floor(timecode - (hours * 3600) - (minutes * 60));\n    var frames = Math.floor((timecode - Math.floor(timecode)) * 24); // Assuming 24 fps\n    var timecodeString = padNumber(hours, 2) + \":\" + padNumber(minutes, 2) + \":\" + padNumber(seconds, 2) + \":\" + padNumber(frames, 2);\n    \n    // Apply cut to all video tracks\n    for (var i = 0; i < sqe.numVideoTracks; i++) {\n        var videoTrack = sqe.getVideoTrackAt(i);\n        videoTrack.razor(timecodeString, true);\n    }\n    \n    // Apply cut to all audio tracks\n    for (var i = 0; i < sqe.numAudioTracks; i++) {\n        var audioTrack = sqe.getAudioTrackAt(i);\n        audioTrack.razor(timecodeString, true);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Using Time Object Formatting (from pymiere/ExtendScript)\n\nThe razor method requires a string timecode argument specifying when to cut the sequence. You can format a Time object to a timecode string using the sequence's video frame rate and display format settings.\n\n### Available CTI Properties\n\nThe active sequence's CTI (Current Time Indicator) provides multiple formats: `activeSequence.CTI.secs` for seconds, `activeSequence.CTI.frames` for frames, `activeSequence.CTI.ticks` for ticks, and `activeSequence.CTI.timecode` for the string timecode format.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nThe PPro ExtendScript QE DOM is officially unsupported and undocumented, with no additional work planned on it.(no content)There's no cut function in the standard ExtendScript API. The QE DOM has a `razor(string, bool, bool)` method on sequence and track objects."],"durationSeconds":49.40737866700001}}

Available Scripting APIs\n\n**Two main APIs exist:**\n\n- **ExtendScript API (Official, Supported)** - The documented, official scripting API for Premiere Pro. Provides access to project elements, sequences, tracks, and track items.\n- **QE DOM (Quality Engineering DOM) - Unsupported** - An internal Adobe testing API that exposes additional functionality including razor operations. Officially unsupported and undocumented, with no planned updates.\n\n**Important timeline:** ExtendScript/CEP support will continue through September 2026. Adobe is transitioning to UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform), but UXP does not yet have razor tool functionality.\n\n---\n\n### 2. ExtendScript API Timeline Manipulation\n\n**Key Objects:**\n\n| Object | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `app.project.activeSequence` | Access the currently active sequence |\n| `Sequence.videoTracks` / `Sequence.audioTracks` | TrackCollection objects containing tracks |\n| `Track.clips` | TrackItemCollection containing clips on a track |\n| `TrackItem` | Individual clip on a track |\n\n**TrackItem Properties (read/write):**\n- `start` / `end` - Visible time in sequence (sequence-relative)\n- `inPoint` / `outPoint` - Source in/out points (source-relative)\n- `duration` - Clip length (read-only)\n- `projectItem` - Reference to source media\n\n**Track Methods:**\n- `insertClip(projectItem, time, vTrackIndex, aTrackIndex)` - Insert media at specified time\n- `overwriteClip(projectItem, time)` - Insert with overwrite mode\n\n**Sequence Methods:**\n- `getSelection()` - Returns array of selected TrackItem objects\n- `setInPoint()` / `setOutPoint()` - Set work area\n- `createSubsequence()` - Extract in/out range as nested sequence\n\n---\n\n### 3. Clip Operations: Razor, Trim, Split\n\n**Critical Limitation: No native cut/razor function exists in the official ExtendScript API.**\n\n**Workaround for simulating a cut:**\n1. Adjust the `end` property of the existing TrackItem to truncate it\n2. Insert a new TrackItem representing the remaining portion using `insertClip()`\n\n**Example of adjusting clip endpoints:**\n```javascript\nvar myClip = app.project.sequences[0].videoTracks[0].clips[0];\nif (myClip) {\n    var oldEnd = myClip.end;\n    if (oldEnd) {\n        oldEnd.seconds = oldEnd.seconds - 1; // Trim 1 second\n        myClip.end = oldEnd;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n**QE DOM Razor Method (Unsupported):**\n```javascript\napp.enableQE();\nvar sqe = qe.project.getActiveSequence();\nvar playerTime = sqe.CTI.timecode; // Format: \"00:00:03:38\"\n\n// Cut on specific track\nsqe.getVideoTrackAt(0).razor(playerTime);\n\n// Or cut on all tracks at sequence level\nsqe.razor(playerTime);\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. Accessing Sequences, Tracks, and Clips Programmatically\n\n**Sequence Access:**\n```javascript\nvar activeSeq = app.project.activeSequence;\nvar allSequences = app.project.sequences; // SequenceCollection\n```\n\n**Track Access:**\n```javascript\nvar videoTracks = activeSeq.videoTracks; // TrackCollection\nvar audioTracks = activeSeq.audioTracks;\nvar firstVideoTrack = videoTracks[0];\n```\n\n**Clip/TrackItem Access:**\n```javascript\nvar clips = firstVideoTrack.clips; // TrackItemCollection\nvar firstClip = clips[0]; // TrackItem\n```\n\n**QE DOM Access (different structure):**\n```javascript\napp.enableQE();\nvar qeSeq = qe.project.getActiveSequence();\nvar qeVideoTrack = qeSeq.getVideoTrackAt(0);\nvar qeClip = qeVideoTrack.getItemAt(0);\n```\n\n**Note:** Objects from the vanilla DOM and QE DOM are incompatible with each other.\n\n---\n\n### 5. API Limitations for Razor-Type Operations\n\n| Limitation | Details |\n|------------|---------|\n| **No native cut/razor in official API** | Must manually adjust clip endpoints and insert new clips |\n| **QE DOM is unsupported** | The `razor()` method exists but is undocumented, unsupported, and may break |\n| **QE razor unlinks clips** | Using QE razor on individual tracks unlinks audio/video; requires manual re-linking |\n| **No vertical track movement** | Cannot move existing clips between tracks programmatically |\n| **No trimming API** | Must manipulate `start`, `end`, `inPoint`, `outPoint` properties directly |\n| **inPoint/outPoint behavior** | These properties behave non-obviously; testing is required |\n| **UXP lacks razor support** | The new UXP API does not yet have any razor tool equivalent |\n| **1-frame timing errors** | Setting in/out points sometimes produces 1-frame errors |\n| **QE DOM update issues** | QE DOM has problems updating itself in response to user interaction |\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\nFor razor/split operations in Premiere Pro:\n\n1. **Official API:** No direct razor function. Simulate by adjusting `end` property and inserting new clips.\n2. **QE DOM:** Has `razor(timecodeString)` method on sequences and tracks, but is officially unsupported.\n3. **UXP (Future):** Does not yet support razor operations; developers needing this functionality should use CEP/ExtendScript for now.\n\n---\n\n**Sources:**\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting Guide - Full Documentation](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/)\n- [Adobe CEP Samples - PProPanel](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx)\n- [Perform a Cut from Script - Adobe Community](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/perform-a-cut-from-script/td-p/11389974)\n- [QE Razor, Link Clips - Adobe Community](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/qe-razor-link-clips/td-p/14848454)\n- [Understanding the Adobe Premiere Pro QE API - Vakago Tools](https://vakago-tools.com/premiere-pro-qe-api/)\n- [UXP Razor Tool Discussion - Adobe Community](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-razor-tool-and-marking-clipped-sections/td-p/15547922)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Premiere Pro Scripting ExtendScript Question - Adobe Community](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-scripting-extendscript-question/td-p/13379442)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":489,"cache_read_input_tokens":23322,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":489,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGe6ZxHgxHLnvWexrG6s","type":"assistant","uuid":"07a9deb2-9c73-404a-81f6-e4a41033ac1c","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:01:14.437Z"}
