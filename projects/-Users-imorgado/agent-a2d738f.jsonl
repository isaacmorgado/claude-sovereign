They're built using Web Components technology.(no content)In order to use them, you are required to install the components individually and then import them before using the component tag.\n\n### Three Ways to Build UI in UXP\nIn UXP, you can write the UI in three ways - using standard HTML Elements, built-in Spectrum UXP widgets, and Spectrum Web Components (recently added).\n\n### Key Components Available\n\n**Buttons:**\n- Action buttons allow users to perform an action or mark a selection. They're used for similar, task-based options within a workflow, and are ideal for interfaces where buttons aren't meant to draw a lot of attention.\n- Buttons allow users to perform an action or to navigate to another page. They have multiple styles for various needs, and are ideal for calling attention to where a user needs to do something in order to move forward in a flow.\n\n**Sliders:**\nSliders allow users to quickly select a value within a predefined range. They are particularly useful when the upper and lower bounds of the range are fixed. Spectrum UXP offers sliders that are visually appealing and intuitive, enabling users to interact with ease and precision.\n\n### 2025 Updates\nAdobe recently released UXP v8.0 in Photoshop 2025 (v26) and InDesign v20.0 with support for new Spectrum Web Components to provide a wholesome UI library that aligns with Adobe's Design Language — Spectrum.(no content)Webviews are particularly helpful for features that are not innately supported in UXP, such as animation, 3D APIs, etc. By allowing local HTML files, they are reducing the overhead of hosting the HTML files in a remote server.\n\n### Additional Components\nThe support for SWC in UXP includes 30 components including some unique ones that are not available in Spectrum widgets such as table, toast, card, etc.(no content)Other available components include action buttons, checkboxes, dividers, links, pickers, radio buttons, text fields, tooltips, and typography.\n\n### Key Considerations\nKeep in mind that UXP is not a browser. It's a platform that provides the ease of using web technologies to build plugins/scripts for desktop applications. Hence, it does not support all the HTML/CSS capabilities you can use in a browser.(no content)Spectrum is Adobe's design system.

In addition to core metadata such as the plugin's name, version, icons, and entry points, the manifest specifies permissions, compatibility details, and other definitions that shape how the plugin integrates with the host environment.\n\n## Manifest Version\n\nPremiere supports manifest version \"5\".\n\n## Permissions for File System and Network Access\n\nPermission-based APIs need to be allow-listed in your plugin's manifest.json. For example, to use the file system or make network requests, you must declare the appropriate permissions.(no content)Depending on the specific access level the plugin requires (for example, to the Network or the Local FileSystem), users may need to grant administrative privileges to the plugin.\n\n## Available Core UXP Functionality\n\nUXP provides file system, networking, shell execution, and core UXP functionality.\n\n## Permissions Philosophy\n\nThe UXP team takes the concepts of Users' trust and consent quite seriously. In this spirit, in the Manifest you're going to declare upfront what kind of permissions your plugin needs, e.g. to open a website, read the clipboard, mess with the Filesystem, etc.(no content)Keep extra permissions at minimum, and include only the ones you really need.

In addition to core metadata such as the plugin's name, version, icons, and entry points, the manifest specifies permissions, compatibility details, and other definitions that shape how the plugin integrates with the host environment.\n\n## Manifest Version\n\nPremiere supports manifest version \"5\".\n\n## Permissions for File System and Network Access\n\nPermission-based APIs need to be allow-listed in your plugin's manifest.json. For example, to use the file system or make network requests, you must declare the appropriate permissions.(no content)Depending on the specific access level the plugin requires (for example, to the Network or the Local FileSystem), users may need to grant administrative privileges to the plugin.\n\n## Available Core UXP Functionality\n\nUXP provides file system, networking, shell execution, and core UXP functionality.\n\n## Permissions Philosophy\n\nThe UXP team takes the concepts of Users' trust and consent quite seriously. In this spirit, in the Manifest you're going to declare upfront what kind of permissions your plugin needs, e.g. to open a website, read the clipboard, mess with the Filesystem, etc.(no content)Keep extra permissions at minimum, and include only the ones you really need. Be also aware that, in addition to the permissions that you have to generically declare in the Manifest, a \"Request for Permission\" popup will open anyway when you reach out for specific resources.\n\n## User Consent\n\nPlugins using Manifest v5 will enjoy the enhancements in security with the introduction of the new permissions model. Users will be asked for their consent when your plugin attempts to use openExternal, openPath, and sp-link/anchor tags. For everything else, consent is given at install time.\n\n## UXP Version Compatibility\n\nUXP plugins are supported in Premiere v25.6 and later since UDT v2.2.(no content)Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.\n\n## Current Availability Note\n\nAs of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins.\n\nFor the full details on specific permission syntax and configuration, you can refer to the official Adobe Premiere Pro UXP documentation at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/"],"durationSeconds":25.91968245799979}}

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP; Unified Extensibility Platform. ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.\n\n### Accessing the Local File System\n\nYou have two options to access the file system - LocalFileSytem and FS module. These modules are very similar in terms of the capabilities they offer, however, there is a difference in the way they carry out the task. LocalFileSytem APIs work with an object reference called Entry. Having an object reference makes it easier to manage and perform multiple operations. Whereas the FS APIs are very similar to NodeJS path-based file system APIs which make them ideal for carrying out single operations.(no content)The localFileSystem is available via `require('uxp').storage.localFileSystem` which returns an instance of FileSystemProvider.\n\n### Basic Usage\n\nYou can access the file system using: `const fs = require(\"uxp\").storage.localFileSystem;`(no content)You can use the fs object to access a temporary folder or your plugin's own folder immediately, or request access to user folders by showing a file picker.\n\n### Sandboxed Locations\n\nUXP, by default, only allows access to certain locations in the user's file system. These locations are referred to as the sandbox. In plugins, a sandbox is typically the plugin's folder, plus a temporary and data folder. The plugin's location is read-only. Whereas, the temporary and data folders are provided to you to store transitory information. Note that the data stored in these locations can get accidentally erased and should not be considered permanent.(no content)UXP provides a shorthand representation of these locations via schemes. For sandbox, you can use `plugin:/`, `plugin-data:/` and `plugin-temp:/`. And, for other locations, use `file:/`.\n\n### Permissions Required\n\nAccessing such locations is possible in UXP but you will need to seek permission first. For file system access you require permission for the localFileSystem module. In plugins, you should seek permission for localFileSystem in your manifest.\n\n### Reading and Writing Files\n\nThe File object reads data from the file and returns it. The file format can be specified with the format option. If a format is not supplied, the file is assumed to be a text file using UTF8 encoding. Returns: Promise<string|ArrayBuffer> the contents of the file.(no content)Writes data to a file, appending if desired. The format of the file is controlled via the format option, and defaults to UTF8.\n\n### XML Operations in ExtendScript (Legacy)\n\nOpens an FCP XML file as a Premiere Pro Project object (specified in projPath). Returns true if file was successfully opened as a Premiere Pro Project object.(no content)Exports an FCP XML representation of the entire project, to the specified output path. Returns 0 if successful.\n\n### File Picker Example\n\nGets a file (or files) from the file system provider for the purpose of opening them. Files are read-only.(no content)Gets a file reference suitable for read-write. Displays a file picker to select a location to \"Save\" the file.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"79b4b399-1431-47d7-a7ba-4ce563c551a4","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:51:56.296Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"UXP file system API localFileSystem read write XML Premiere Pro","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Wh422mrM3m8vuQMqgkqMQa","content":[{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Storage APIs · Adobe XD Plugin Reference","url":"https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/reference/uxp/storage-index.html"},{"title":"require('uxp').storage.localFileSystem","url":"https://adobedocs.github.io/uxp-photoshop/uxp-api/reference-js/Modules/uxp/Persistent%20File%20Storage/FileSystemProvider/"},{"title":"File operations","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/recipes/file-operation/"},{"title":"File","url":"https://adobedocs.github.io/uxp-photoshop/uxp-api/reference-js/Modules/uxp/Persistent%20File%20Storage/File/"},{"title":"Storage module · Adobe XD Plugin Reference","url":"https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/reference/uxp/module/storage.html"},{"title":"UXP accessing files and folders - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-accessing-files-and-folders/5930"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"XD Plugin Lab: Part Four, Step 2: File I/O · GitHub","url":"https://gist.github.com/kerrishotts/63051639d191dad49992ae3ebe900d77"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about UXP file system API, localFileSystem, reading/writing files, XML, and Premiere Pro:\n\n## UXP File System API for Premiere Pro\n\n### Overview\nUXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere Pro and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications.

However, they are, in the background, asynchronous in nature.\n\n## executeAsModal Overview\n\nHow do you create a modal scope? With the executeAsModal() function, with which you're going to wrap all offending calls.\n\n### When Modal State is Required\n\nModal state is required when:\n- Dealing with File I/O (e.g., saving a document)\n- Setting some properties via BatchPlay (e.g., History states)\n- Acting on layers (e.g., running Filters or Adjustments)\n- Anything else that \"may modify the state\" of the application\n\n### Best Practices for executeAsModal\n\n**Nested Modal Scopes:**\nYou can have nested modal scopes. A target function can itself call executeAsModal to execute another target function. All modal scopes share the same global modal state.\n\n**User Cancellation Handling:**\nexecuteAsModal puts the application into a modal state, and it is important to allow the user to exit this state if the command was invoked by mistake, or if the command is taking too much time. The user can cancel the operation by pressing the Escape key or using cancellation UI in the progress bar. If the user cancels the interaction, then JavaScript should return from its target function as soon as possible.(no content)JavaScript can use isCancelled and onCancel on the executionContext to get information about the current user cancellation state.\n\n**Interactive Mode:**\nIf a plugin requires the accepting of user input or interaction while in an executeAsModal scope, \"Interactive Mode\" may be required. This mode refrains from displaying a blocking progress dialog to the user, and reduces the number of restrictions that hinder accepting of user input. Use-cases for interactive mode may include: allowing users to input data into an invoked modal filter dialog, or awaiting user input on a workspace.\n\n**Progress Updates:**\nJavaScript can change the message that is shown in the progress UI by using the commandName property. This can be used to inform the user about the current stage of the operation.\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP Architecture\n\nUXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs.

However, they are, in the background, asynchronous in nature.\n\n## executeAsModal Overview\n\nHow do you create a modal scope? With the executeAsModal() function, with which you're going to wrap all offending calls.\n\n### When Modal State is Required\n\nModal state is required when:\n- Dealing with File I/O (e.g., saving a document)\n- Setting some properties via BatchPlay (e.g., History states)\n- Acting on layers (e.g., running Filters or Adjustments)\n- Anything else that \"may modify the state\" of the application\n\n### Best Practices for executeAsModal\n\n**Nested Modal Scopes:**\nYou can have nested modal scopes. A target function can itself call executeAsModal to execute another target function. All modal scopes share the same global modal state.\n\n**User Cancellation Handling:**\nexecuteAsModal puts the application into a modal state, and it is important to allow the user to exit this state if the command was invoked by mistake, or if the command is taking too much time. The user can cancel the operation by pressing the Escape key or using cancellation UI in the progress bar. If the user cancels the interaction, then JavaScript should return from its target function as soon as possible.(no content)JavaScript can use isCancelled and onCancel on the executionContext to get information about the current user cancellation state.\n\n**Interactive Mode:**\nIf a plugin requires the accepting of user input or interaction while in an executeAsModal scope, \"Interactive Mode\" may be required. This mode refrains from displaying a blocking progress dialog to the user, and reduces the number of restrictions that hinder accepting of user input. Use-cases for interactive mode may include: allowing users to input data into an invoked modal filter dialog, or awaiting user input on a workspace.\n\n**Progress Updates:**\nJavaScript can change the message that is shown in the progress UI by using the commandName property. This can be used to inform the user about the current stage of the operation.\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP Architecture\n\nUXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between the two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment, and you just need to require() the appropriate modules to access the APIs you need.\n\n## Current Status\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).

They're built using Web Components technology. In order to use them, you are required to install the components individually and then import them before using the component tag.\n\n## Installation via npm\n\n### sp-button\nStart using @spectrum-web-components/button in your project by running `npm i @spectrum-web-components/button`.(no content)An `<sp-button>` represents an action a user can take. sp-buttons can be clicked or tapped to perform an action or to navigate to another page. Buttons in Spectrum have several variations for different uses and multiple levels of loudness for various attention-getting needs.\n\n### sp-slider\nThe `<sp-slider>` allows users to quickly select a value within a range. They should be used when the upper and lower bounds of the range are invariable.(no content)When looking to leverage the Slider base class as a type and/or for extension purposes, do so via: `import { Slider } from '@spectrum-web-components/slider';`\n\n### UXP-Specific Wrappers\nFor UXP projects specifically, you can start using @swc-uxp-wrappers/button by running `npm i @swc-uxp-wrappers/button`. There are 7 other projects in the npm registry using @swc-uxp-wrappers/button.\n\n## Key Differences in UXP\n\nThe support for SWC in UXP is more extensive. It has 30 components including some unique ones that are not available in Spectrum widgets such as table, toast, card, etc. Plus, these components follow the principles of SWC and web components, which means you need to install and import individual components before using them.(no content)For built-in Spectrum UXP widgets (the older approach), you don't need to import or load anything in your projects in order to use them: they are available straight away, just use them in your HTML.\n\n## React Integration\nThere's also a library called react-uxp-spectrum that provides a complete set of React components for use in Adobe UXP extensions. At the time of writing, React Spectrum is not entirely universal and there exist many quirks to the use of Spectrum components in React. This package aims to make development of UXP plugins using React a breeze and encapsulates all of the quirks and oddities that come with a web-component based library being used in React.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"3cec261b-0f7e-47d4-95ce-a0cb93ec6387","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:54:31.592Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"UXP spectrum-web-components sp-slider sp-button installation npm","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01K6BN1zDKVxkbStuHGEskDb","content":[{"title":"Spectrum Web Component (SWC)","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/swc/"},{"title":"How to use spectrum web components on a uxp react plugin - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/how-to-use-spectrum-web-components-on-a-uxp-react-plugin/6395"},{"title":"@spectrum-web-components/button - npm","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/button"},{"title":"GitHub - thejustinwalsh/react-uxp-spectrum: Adobe UXP Spectrum Web Components for React","url":"https://github.com/thejustinwalsh/react-uxp-spectrum"},{"title":"Spectrum UXP Reference","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/"},{"title":"@spectrum-web-components/slider - npm","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@spectrum-web-components/slider"},{"title":"@swc-uxp-wrappers/button - npm","url":"https://www.npmjs.com/package/@swc-uxp-wrappers/button"},{"title":"Spectrum Web Component (Beta)","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/reference/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/swc/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #9 Adobe Spectrum | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/Adobe-UXP-things-you-need-to-know-9-Adobe-Spectrum-UXP.html"},{"title":"Spectrum Web Component - GitHub Pages","url":"https://adobedocs.github.io/uxp-photoshop/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/swc/"}]},"Based on my search results, here's information about UXP Spectrum Web Components (SWC), including sp-slider, sp-button, and npm installation:\n\n## UXP Spectrum Web Components Overview\n\nUXP v7.0 introduces the support for Web Components and Spectrum Web Components (SWC).(no content)These are the Adobe Spectrum Web Components, supported from UXP v7.0 onwards.

The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBegin by downloading the UXP Hybrid plugin SDK from Developer Console. Unpack the contents and make sure you check out the README.md. There are special instructions for building and packaging hybrid plugins since they are different from a standard UXP plugin.(no content)The template-dev walks you through a very basic example that illustrates how the two worlds communicate. Try the ready-to-use template-plugin provided within the SDK to say a quick 'Hello world!'. Load the template via UDT, and find it under the Plugins menu.\n\n## C++ Entry Point Example\n\nA hybrid plugin can get access to Photoshop C-based APIs by exposing an additional function entry point. After Photoshop loads a hybrid addOn, it will invoke this method. The basicSuite argument can be used to obtain Photoshop API suites. See the C++ SDK for information about how to acquire Photoshop suites.\n\nThe entry point signature looks like:\n```cpp\nexport SPErr PSDLLMain(const char* selector, SPBasicSuite* basicSuite, PIActionDescriptor descriptor);\n```\n\nTo test this, you can add to module.cpp from the hybrid plugin sample includes like \"SPBasic.h\" and \"PIColorSpaceSuite.h\".\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn order to build and test your plugins, you will need at least Photoshop v24.2.0 and UDT v1.7.0. To publish and distribute your plugin, Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop v5.10 is required.(no content)You need to prepare binaries for all three architectures: Mac M1, Mac Intel, and Windows Intel.\n\n## Communication Between C++ and JavaScript\n\nThis is different from what's possible with CEP + CSDK (or even UXP + CSDK) in that the C++ code is distributed with and runs alongside the JavaScript code. Communication between the two happens via an API layer modeled against NodeJS N-API.\n\n## Build Tools\n\nThe project is set up for Visual Studio 2019.

The dynamically linked shared objects written in C++ are available to JavaScript.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nBegin by downloading the UXP Hybrid plugin SDK from Developer Console. Unpack the contents and make sure you check out the README.md. There are special instructions for building and packaging hybrid plugins since they are different from a standard UXP plugin.(no content)The template-dev walks you through a very basic example that illustrates how the two worlds communicate. Try the ready-to-use template-plugin provided within the SDK to say a quick 'Hello world!'. Load the template via UDT, and find it under the Plugins menu.\n\n## C++ Entry Point Example\n\nA hybrid plugin can get access to Photoshop C-based APIs by exposing an additional function entry point. After Photoshop loads a hybrid addOn, it will invoke this method. The basicSuite argument can be used to obtain Photoshop API suites. See the C++ SDK for information about how to acquire Photoshop suites.\n\nThe entry point signature looks like:\n```cpp\nexport SPErr PSDLLMain(const char* selector, SPBasicSuite* basicSuite, PIActionDescriptor descriptor);\n```\n\nTo test this, you can add to module.cpp from the hybrid plugin sample includes like \"SPBasic.h\" and \"PIColorSpaceSuite.h\".\n\n## Requirements\n\nIn order to build and test your plugins, you will need at least Photoshop v24.2.0 and UDT v1.7.0. To publish and distribute your plugin, Adobe Creative Cloud Desktop v5.10 is required.(no content)You need to prepare binaries for all three architectures: Mac M1, Mac Intel, and Windows Intel.\n\n## Communication Between C++ and JavaScript\n\nThis is different from what's possible with CEP + CSDK (or even UXP + CSDK) in that the C++ code is distributed with and runs alongside the JavaScript code. Communication between the two happens via an API layer modeled against NodeJS N-API.\n\n## Build Tools\n\nThe project is set up for Visual Studio 2019. A post-build action will copy the resulting .uxpaddon binary to the ./public-hybrid folder. If you are using a different version of Visual Studio, you may need to update settings for this to work, but Adobe recommends 2019 currently.\n\n## Additional Resources\n\n- **Official Documentation**: https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/\n- **Getting Started Guide**: https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/getting-started/\n- **Sample C++ Code Gist**: https://gist.github.com/padmkris123/e689597d7f9b68407a753dd7d17bb224\n- **Bolt UXP Boilerplate** (includes hybrid support): https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp\n\nCurrently, hybrid plugins are only supported in Photoshop."],"durationSeconds":28.456777250000275}}

Manifest.json Configuration\n\n**Manifest Version:** Premiere Pro requires manifest version \"5\"\n\n**Complete manifest.json structure with required permissions:**\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"com.yourcompany.premiereplugin\",\n  \"name\": \"Your Plugin Name\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.js\",\n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"premierepro\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"25.6.0\"\n  },\n  \"entrypoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"mainPanel\",\n      \"label\": \"Settings Panel\",\n      \"minimumSize\": { \"width\": 300, \"height\": 400 },\n      \"maximumSize\": { \"width\": 600, \"height\": 800 },\n      \"preferredDockedSize\": { \"width\": 300, \"height\": 400 },\n      \"preferredFloatingSize\": { \"width\": 400, \"height\": 500 }\n    }\n  ],\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"localFileSystem\": \"fullAccess\",\n    \"clipboard\": \"readAndWrite\",\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": [\"localhost\", \"127.0.0.1\"]\n    },\n    \"launchProcess\": {\n      \"schemes\": [\"file\"],\n      \"extensions\": [\".xml\", \".json\"]\n    },\n    \"allowCodeGenerationFromStrings\": true\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**Key Permissions Explained:**\n- `localFileSystem: \"fullAccess\"` - Required for XML read/write operations\n- `network.domains` - For communicating with local helper service (FFprobe workaround)\n- `launchProcess` - For opening files with system applications\n\n---\n\n### 2. Launching External Processes (FFprobe Challenge)\n\n**Critical Limitation:** UXP does NOT support direct shell command execution like `exec()` or `spawn()`. The `shell` API is limited to:\n- `shell.openPath()` - Opens files with default application\n- `shell.openExternal()` - Opens URLs with system applications\n\n**Recommended Workaround - Local HTTP Service Architecture:**\n\n```\n+------------------+       HTTP        +-------------------+\n|  UXP Plugin      | <---------------> | Local Node Server |\n|  (Premiere Pro)  |    localhost:3000 | (FFprobe Runner)  |\n+------------------+                   +-------------------+\n                                              |\n                                              v\n                                        +----------+\n                                        | FFprobe  |\n                                        +----------+\n```\n\n**UXP Plugin Code (client):**\n```javascript\nasync function analyzeAudio(filePath) {\n  const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3000/analyze', {\n    method: 'POST',\n    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },\n    body: JSON.stringify({ filePath })\n  });\n  return response.json();\n}\n```\n\n**Node.js Helper Service (separate process):**\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst { exec } = require('child_process');\n\napp.post('/analyze', (req, res) => {\n  const { filePath } = req.body;\n  exec(`ffprobe -v quiet -print_format json -show_format -show_streams \"${filePath}\"`, \n    (error, stdout) => {\n      res.json(JSON.parse(stdout));\n    });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. File System APIs for XML Manipulation\n\n**Two approaches available:**\n\n**Option A: LocalFileSystem (Entry-based, recommended for multiple operations)**\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('uxp').storage.localFileSystem;\n\n// User file picker for XML\nasync function selectXMLFile() {\n  const file = await fs.getFileForOpening({ types: ['xml'] });\n  const content = await file.read();\n  return content;\n}\n\n// Save XML file\nasync function saveXMLFile(xmlContent) {\n  const file = await fs.getFileForSaving('sequence.xml');\n  await file.write(xmlContent);\n}\n\n// Access plugin data folder (for settings)\nasync function getSettingsPath() {\n  const dataFolder = await fs.getDataFolder();\n  return dataFolder;\n}\n```\n\n**Option B: FS Module (NodeJS-like, simpler for single operations)**\n```javascript\nconst fs = require('fs');\n\n// Read file (requires user to grant access first)\nasync function readXML(path) {\n  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {\n    fs.readFile(path, 'utf8', (err, data) => {\n      if (err) reject(err);\n      else resolve(data);\n    });\n  });\n}\n```\n\n**Sandboxed Locations (no picker required):**\n- `plugin:/` - Plugin folder (read-only)\n- `plugin-data:/` - Persistent plugin data\n- `plugin-temp:/` - Temporary files\n\n---\n\n### 4. Sequence Export/Import (XML)\n\n**Current Status:** The ExtendScript API methods (`exportFCPXML`, `openFCPXML`) are still functional but UXP-native equivalents are emerging.\n\n**ExtendScript Approach (works until Sept 2026):**\n```javascript\n// Export FCP XML\napp.project.exportFCPXML(outputPath);\n\n// Import FCP XML\napp.openFCPXML(xmlPath, projectPath);\n```\n\n**UXP ProjectItem API:**\n```javascript\nconst ppro = require('premierepro');\n\n// Get active sequence\nconst project = await ppro.Project.getActiveProject();\nconst sequence = await project.getActiveSequence();\n\n// Access project items\nconst rootItem = await project.getRootItem();\nconst items = await rootItem.getItems();\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. Async Operations Best Practices\n\n**Key Principle:** All UXP Premiere Pro API calls are asynchronous (unlike ExtendScript).\n\n```javascript\n// executeAsModal for state-modifying operations\nconst { executeAsModal } = require('photoshop').core;  // Pattern from PS, check PPro equivalent\n\nasync function performOperation() {\n  await executeAsModal(async (executionContext) => {\n    // Check for user cancellation\n    if (executionContext.isCancelled) {\n      return;\n    }\n    \n    // Update progress message\n    executionContext.reportProgress({\n      commandName: \"Processing audio...\"\n    });\n    \n    // Your operations here\n    await processAudio();\n    \n  }, { commandName: \"Audio Analysis\" });\n}\n```\n\n**Error Handling Pattern:**\n```javascript\nasync function safeOperation() {\n  try {\n    const result = await riskyOperation();\n    return { success: true, data: result };\n  } catch (error) {\n    console.error('Operation failed:', error);\n    return { success: false, error: error.message };\n  }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 6. Spectrum UI Components for Settings Panel\n\n**Installation (npm):**\n```bash\nnpm i @spectrum-web-components/slider\nnpm i @spectrum-web-components/button\nnpm i @spectrum-web-components/textfield\nnpm i @spectrum-web-components/picker\n# Or use UXP-specific wrappers:\nnpm i @swc-uxp-wrappers/button\n```\n\n**Usage in HTML/JSX:**\n```javascript\n// Import components\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/slider';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/button';\nimport '@spectrum-web-components/picker';\n```\n\n```html\n<!-- Settings Panel UI -->\n<sp-field-group>\n  <sp-field-label for=\"threshold\">Audio Threshold</sp-field-label>\n  <sp-slider \n    id=\"threshold\"\n    min=\"0\" \n    max=\"100\" \n    value=\"50\"\n    label=\"dB\">\n  </sp-slider>\n</sp-field-group>\n\n<sp-button variant=\"cta\" onclick=\"runAnalysis()\">\n  Analyze Audio\n</sp-button>\n\n<sp-button variant=\"secondary\" onclick=\"exportSettings()\">\n  Export Settings\n</sp-button>\n\n<sp-picker label=\"Output Format\">\n  <sp-menu-item value=\"xml\">FCP XML</sp-menu-item>\n  <sp-menu-item value=\"json\">JSON</sp-menu-item>\n</sp-picker>\n```\n\n**Built-in Spectrum Widgets (no import needed):**\n```html\n<!-- These work immediately without npm install -->\n<sp-button>Click Me</sp-button>\n<sp-textfield placeholder=\"Enter value\"></sp-textfield>\n<sp-checkbox>Enable feature</sp-checkbox>\n```\n\n---\n\n### Recommended Plugin Architecture\n\n```\npremiere-plugin/\n├── manifest.json\n├── index.js                    # Main entry point\n├── index.html                  # Panel UI\n├── src/\n│   ├── ui/\n│   │   ├── SettingsPanel.js    # Spectrum components\n│   │   └── styles.css\n│   ├── services/\n│   │   ├── AudioAnalyzer.js    # HTTP calls to helper service\n│   │   ├── XMLHandler.js       # File system operations\n│   │   └── SequenceExporter.js # Premiere API calls\n│   └── utils/\n│       └── asyncHelpers.js     # Error handling, modal execution\n├── helper-service/             # Separate Node.js app\n│   ├── package.json\n│   ├── server.js               # Express server\n│   └── ffprobe-runner.js       # FFprobe execution\n└── assets/\n    └── icons/\n```\n\n---\n\n### Key Constraints and Recommendations\n\n1. **FFprobe Execution:** Requires external helper service. Consider packaging a lightweight Node.js service or Electron app that runs alongside the plugin.\n\n2. **UXP Availability:** UXP for Premiere Pro is currently in BETA (requires Premiere Pro v25.6+). Production deployment may need to wait for stable release.\n\n3. **Hybrid Plugins:** C++ hybrid plugins are only supported in Photoshop currently, not Premiere Pro.\n\n4. **ExtendScript Bridge:** For sequence XML export/import, you may need to bridge to ExtendScript until full UXP API coverage is available (supported until Sept 2026).\n\n5. **User Consent:** File system and network operations will prompt users for permission at runtime per manifest v5 security model.\n\n---\n\n### Sources\n\n- [Premiere Pro UXP Plugin Manifest](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/concepts/manifest/)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Understanding UXP APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/)\n- [UXP Manifest v5 Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/uxp_guide/uxp-misc/manifest-v5/)\n- [Launch Process Recipe (InDesign)](https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/resources/recipes/launch-process/)\n- [UXP Shell API](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-js/Modules/uxp/shell/Shell/)\n- [LocalFileSystem API](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-js/Modules/uxp/Persistent%20File%20Storage/FileSystemProvider/)\n- [executeAsModal Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/ps_reference/media/executeasmodal/)\n- [Spectrum Web Components for UXP](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-spectrum/swc/)\n- [Alchemist Plugin manifest.json Example](https://github.com/jardicc/alchemist/blob/master/uxp/manifest.json)\n- [Bolt-UXP Boilerplate](https://github.com/hyperbrew/bolt-uxp)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro Samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [Adobe UXP Hybrid Plugins](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/hybrid-plugins/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1218,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1548,"cache_read_input_tokens":27433,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1548,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGiD9tLwdsWUwjq3ibu4","type":"assistant","uuid":"19618d49-cdd3-4442-8e7d-4cbfdff0e9ad","timestamp":"2025-12-19T20:55:53.652Z"}
