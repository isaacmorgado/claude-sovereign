     1→# Beautifier & Interceptor
     2→
     3→A rather handy little toolkit for developers who need to make sense of messy code and keep an eye on their API traffic. Built with Next.js, it combines two essential tools into one sleek interface.
     4→
     5→## What's It All About?
     6→
     7→Ever found yourself staring at a wall of minified JavaScript, wondering what on earth it does? Or perhaps you've needed to document an API but couldn't be bothered to write the spec by hand? This app sorts both of those problems, and then some.
     8→
     9→### The Code Beautifier
    10→
    11→Pop your minified or obfuscated JavaScript into the left panel, click the sparkly button, and watch it transform into something actually readable. But we didn't stop there — once your code is beautified, you can ask the AI to explain what it does. Quite useful when you're reverse-engineering someone else's work or trying to understand that script you wrote at 3am six months ago.
    12→
    13→**How to use it:**
    14→1. Paste your minified JavaScript into the input panel
    15→2. Click **Beautify**
    16→3. Marvel at the nicely formatted output
    17→4. Hit **Explain** if you'd like the AI to walk you through what the code does
    18→
    19→### The Traffic Interceptor
    20→
    21→This is where things get properly interesting. The Interceptor lets you capture HTTP traffic flowing through your applications, then do clever things with it.
    22→
    23→**What you can do:**
    24→- **View Sessions** — See all your captured traffic sessions at a glance
    25→- **Security Scanning** — Run automated scans to spot potential vulnerabilities (the OWASP Top 10 sort of thing)
    26→- **OpenAPI Generation** — Automatically generate API documentation from your captured requests
    27→- **AI Assistant** — Have a chat with Claude about your traffic, ask questions, get insights
    28→- **Saved Insights** — Keep the good bits for later
    29→
    30→**Getting started with traffic capture:**
    31→```bash
    32→# Fire up the interceptor in passive mode
    33→interceptor capture --mode passive --port 8888
    34→
    35→# Then configure your application to proxy through localhost:8888
    36→```
    37→
    38→Once you've captured some traffic, head over to `/interceptor` in the app and you'll see your sessions ready and waiting.
    39→
    40→## Setting Things Up
    41→
    42→### Prerequisites
    43→
    44→You'll need:
    45→- Node.js 18 or newer
    46→- A PostgreSQL database
    47→- About five minutes of your time
    48→
    49→### Quick Start
    50→
    51→```bash
    52→# Clone it down
    53→git clone https://github.com/creativeprofit22/Beautifier-Interceptor-App.git
    54→cd Beautifier-Interceptor-App
    55→
    56→# One command to rule them all
    57→npm run setup
    58→```
    59→
    60→The setup script handles dependencies, environment configuration, and database setup. If you prefer doing things manually, read on.
    61→
    62→### Manual Setup
    63→
    64→```bash
    65→# Install dependencies
    66→npm install
    67→
    68→# Set up your environment
    69→cp .env.example .env
    70→# Then edit .env with your database credentials and secrets
    71→
    72→# Generate the Prisma client
    73→npx prisma generate
    74→
    75→# Push the schema to your database
    76→npm run db:push
    77→```
    78→
    79→### Environment Variables
    80→
    81→Your `.env` file needs a few things:
    82→
    83→```bash
    84→# Database connection (required)
    85→DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/beautifier"
    86→
    87→# Auth secret — generate one with: npx auth secret
    88→AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-here"
    89→
    90→# GitHub OAuth (for authentication)
    91→AUTH_GITHUB_ID="your-github-client-id"
    92→AUTH_GITHUB_SECRET="your-github-client-secret"
    93→```
    94→
    95→**Setting up GitHub OAuth:**
    96→1. Head to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
    97→2. Create a new OAuth App
    98→3. Set the callback URL to `http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback/github`
    99→4. Copy the credentials into your `.env`
   100→
   101→### Running the App
   102→
   103→```bash
   104→# Development (with Turbopack for speed)
   105→npm run dev
   106→
   107→# Production
   108→npm run build && npm start
   109→```
   110→
   111→Open [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you're away.
