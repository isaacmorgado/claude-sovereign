The event will take place in three months and you'll be managing a team of five interns to help plan the event.</p>\n<p>It is your first time in a project management role and you want to prove to him that you are knowledgeable and well-equipped to take on these types of duties. He prefers to not micromanage you, but would like he and his team of executives to be aware of your plans before you start the project. To do this, he has asked that you put together a 10-15-slide PowerPoint presentation, for the company's board of directors, that is visually engaging, includes project management tools, and answers the following questions:</p>\n<ul>\n <li>What are your cost estimates for the project?
