The AI analyzes the structure, tempo, and mood—not the melody or copyrighted content.(no content)The generator doesn't copy melodies—it captures overall mood, tempo, and structure to create something original. It's a vibe match, not a clone.\n\n### Training Data Concerns\nOne-size-fits-all AI tools are risky (some train on copyrighted songs without consent). These black-box models are a legal grey zone—and that uncertainty can cost you.(no content)When training datasets include copyrighted material without permission, any derivative outputs risk infringing third-party rights. Even if an AI sample seems novel, underlying elements may mirror protected works. Musicians should verify whether an AI service sources data ethically.\n\n## Major Lawsuits & Legal Arguments\n\nA group of major music labels has banded together to sue the leading generative AI music creation websites. Universal Music Group, Sony Music, and Warner Music Group have sued online music AI generators, Suno AI and Udio AI, for alleged copyright infringement, accusing them of replicating their artists' music using AI technology.(no content)Suno argues that even if its AI learned from copyrighted songs, the outputs it generates are entirely new sounds that cannot infringe existing recordings under copyright law.(no content)Suno's filing highlights recent federal court victories for AI companies, noting that in June 2025, a California federal judge found AI training to be protected fair use in the Bartz v. Anthropic PBC case.(no content)However, the independent artists' lawsuit relies on a May 2025 report from the U.S. Copyright Office that questions whether AI training on copyrighted works qualifies as fair use, particularly for music generation.\n\n## Platform Policies & Best Practices\n\nYouTube updated their policies in July 2025 to address AI-generated content. Music without \"clear human input\" may face limited reach, blocked monetisation, or takedowns.(no content)If the composer exercises significant creative control—such as selecting prompts, editing melodies, or writing lyrics—AI-assisted tracks meet the originality requirement and qualify for U.S. copyright protection. Significant input includes nontrivial edits that reflect personal artistry: reordering sections, customizing instrumentation, fine-tuning melodies, or overlaying original lyrics.(no content)Best practices include: Document everything—save your prompts, save your creative process, keep records of any modifications you made. Add significant human modifications. The more you genuinely transform the AI output, the stronger your legal position. This isn't just tweaking the EQ—this means substantial creative changes.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"05acb091-1114-4ebf-b880-18935c89b9e6","timestamp":"2025-12-26T08:32:02.991Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"AI music sound-alike reference track generation legal copyright 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01VFxwHFCjmwaGQMZKPsUsrR","content":[{"title":"Soundverse Similar Song Generator: Finally, AI Music That Won’t Get You Sued","url":"https://www.soundverse.ai/blog/article/soundverse-similar-song-generator-finally-ai-music-that-won-t-get-you-sued"},{"title":"AI Music Copyright Laws 2025: How Musicians Can Protect AI-Generated Songs | Mureka","url":"https://www.mureka.ai/hub/aimusic/ai-music-copyright-laws/"},{"title":"AI Music Copyright & Ownership in 2025: How Creators Protect and Monetize Their Tracks | Mureka","url":"https://www.mureka.ai/hub/aimusic/who-owns-ai-music/"},{"title":"AI Music Copyright: Legal Risks Content Creators Must Know (2025)","url":"https://www.silvermansound.com/ai-music-copyright-legal-risks-content-creators"},{"title":"Suno argues none of the millions of tracks made on its platform ‘contain anything like a sample’ - Music Business Worldwide","url":"https://www.musicbusinessworldwide.com/suno-argues-none-of-the-millions-of-tracks-made-on-its-platform-contain-anything-like-a-sample/"},{"title":"US Court Bans Copyright for AI Art – What Musicians & Creators Must Know in 2025","url":"https://www.soundverse.ai/blog/article/us-court-bans-copyright-for-ai-art-what-musicians-and-creators-must-know-in-2025"},{"title":"Major American Music Labels Sue Generative AI Music Platforms in First Case of Its Kind Over AI Audio | Crowell & Moring LLP","url":"https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/major-american-music-labels-sue-generative-ai-music-platforms-in-first-case-of-its-kind-over-ai-audio"},{"title":"AI-Generated Music Copyright: Legal Limits, Human Authorship, and Best Practices in 2025 | Abounaja IP","url":"https://abounaja.com/blog/ai-generated-music-copyright-legal-limits-human-authorship-and-best-practices-in-2025"},{"title":"Who Owns AI Generated Music?

Time spent creating content has plateaued, and key drivers behind the pandemic's content creation boom are weakening. Growth now depends on AI tools to bring more first-time creators into the funnel and alleviate pain points blocking video creator progression.(no content)MIDiA Research released a report showing that the number of global creators is set to surge by 76% to 1.1 billion by 2032. The findings highlight a creator economy entering a transformative new phase—one defined by the integration of AI-powered productivity tools, the rise of creator-led studios, and traditional entertainment companies shifting towards social-first engagement strategies.\n\n### AI in Music Market Size & Growth\n\nThe global AI in Music market size accounted for USD 5.20 billion in 2024 and is predicted to increase from USD 6.65 billion in 2025 to approximately USD 60.44 billion by 2034, expanding at a CAGR of 27.80% from 2025 to 2034.(no content)In 2025, the AI music industry is expected to reach a staggering $6.2 billion, with projections pushing it to $38.7 billion by 2033. Generative AI alone is set to hit $2.92 billion this year.\n\n### Pain Points & Production Challenges\n\nMusic production is exhausting. It's beautiful, rewarding, inspiring—but it's also time-consuming and expensive. Whether you're a bedroom producer, mix-for-hire engineer, or DIY vocalist, the hidden cost of doing everything the traditional way is massive. Not just financially, but creatively too.(no content)Studio Time: Recording in a pro studio can cost up to $1,000 per day. Even in home studios, creators burn countless hours setting up mics, adjusting levels, comping takes.\n\n### AI Adoption Statistics\n\nAmong self-releasing artists, 48% have already tried AI tools—everything from mastering and vocal cleanup to lyric generators and album art design. And the number who say they'll \"never use AI\"? That's dropped from 29% in 2023 to just 18% in 2025.(no content)Around 60% of musicians now use AI tools for mastering, composing, or creating artwork.(no content)Growth factors driving AI adoption in music include the accessibility of advanced AI tools that reduce music production time by up to 50%, allowing musicians to experiment with more ideas faster.\n\n### Challenges & Concerns\n\nAI's entry into media complicates issues surrounding creativity, originality, and authorship. With generative AI producing high-quality art, music, and videos, fears of substituting human creativity increase. Copyright, deepfakes, and transparency in content source are difficult issues to grapple with. They raise ethical concerns and are likely to trigger regulatory scrutiny where AI-generated content imitates real people or infringes intellectual property rights.(no content)77% of people are concerned that AI-generated music doesn't appropriately credit the original artists.(no content)Research by media consultancy Goldmedia predicts that with proper compensation systems for human creators, musicians could retain up to 27% of their revenue by 2028 as AI-generated content grows. This highlights the urgent need for balanced regulations in AI music creation.\n\n### Video Creator Tools Market\n\nAccording to MIDiA's latest data, the video creator value chain was worth $8.7 billion in 2024, driven by a near doubling of AI tools revenues to $215.5 million and a 11% rise in creative app revenues to $2.1 billion. Global video creator tools revenues are projected to grow by 9% year-on-year, reaching $9.7 billion in 2025.\n\nThe search did not return specific survey data focused exclusively on video editors' pain points with AI music tools. The results primarily cover broader AI music market research and general creator economy trends rather than detailed survey findings on this specific niche topic.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"868edc23-b040-49f4-ba91-c2f74eb684da","timestamp":"2025-12-26T08:32:08.128Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"video editor AI music pain point survey market research 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_013w2rTw5YQJ5YyMbzxbkB46","content":[{"title":"MIDiA Reports","url":"https://www.midiaresearch.com/reports"},{"title":"AI In Media & Entertainment Market Research Report 2025-2033: Increasing Demand for Content Personalization, Video Editing Automation, Real-time Measurement, and Improved User Experiences - ResearchAndMarkets.com","url":"https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20251002718744/en/AI-In-Media-Entertainment-Market-Research-Report-2025-2033-Increasing-Demand-for-Content-Personalization-Video-Editing-Automation-Real-time-Measurement-and-Improved-User-Experiences---ResearchAndMarkets.com"},{"title":"AI in Music Industry Statistics 2025: Market Growth & Trends","url":"https://artsmart.ai/blog/ai-in-music-industry-statistics/"},{"title":"AI or Die: Why AI-Savvy Music Producers Are Leaving Their Peers in the Dust - Sonarworks Blog","url":"https://www.sonarworks.com/blog/research/ai-music-production-2025"},{"title":"Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) In Music Market 2025","url":"https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/generative-artificial-intelligence-ai-in-music-global-market-report"},{"title":"AI in Music Market Size, Share, Trend | CAGR of 27.8%","url":"https://market.us/report/ai-in-music-market/"},{"title":"AI Music Statistics 2025 – Market Size & Trends","url":"https://simplebeen.com/ai-music-statistics/"},{"title":"AI in Music Market Report 2025 - Growth and Size to 2034","url":"https://www.thebusinessresearchcompany.com/report/artificial-intelligence-ai-in-music-global-market-report"},{"title":"New MIDiA report forecasts one billion creators by 2032 as AI reshapes the creative value chain","url":"https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/new-midia-report-forecasts-one-billion-creators-by-2032-as-ai-reshapes-the-creative-value-chain"},{"title":"Audio or Visual Generative AI Market | Size, Share, Growth | 2025 - 2030","url":"https://virtuemarketresearch.com/report/audio-or-visual-generative-ai-market"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found regarding video editors, AI music, pain points, and market research for 2025:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Video Creator Economy & AI Tools\n\nThe video creator economy is entering a new stage of its development.
