It's not only about tokens per second speed but also input processing, tokenization, and prompt loading; it takes so much time that it's testing users' patience. People often mention TPS numbers, but they neglect to mention the input loading times.\n- The consensus is that unless you have a multi-GPU cluster, the cloud experience is superior for daily coding work.\n\n### Software/Integration Issues\n- Successfully leveraging GLM-4.7's advanced capabilities requires precise handling of reasoning tokens. Experienced developers noted that many popular third-party frontends and libraries fail to pass these tokens back to the model correctly, causing it to fail at tasks it is theoretically capable of solving. This highlighted a significant \"integration gap\": the model weights are available, but the surrounding software ecosystem is often broken.\n- To get the most out of GLM-4.7, developers may need to \"roll their own\" implementations rather than relying on generic, off-the-shelf tools that haven't yet adapted to these new \"thinking\" architectures.\n\n### Design/UI Limitations\n- While GLM 4.7 excels in many areas, it is not without its limitations. The model struggles with replicating complex designs, such as a Spotify clone, where placeholders and styling often require manual refinement.\n\n### Speed Trade-offs\n- While it may be bypassed by MiniMax M2 in pure speed or by DeepSeek in specific mathematical niches, its overall balance makes it the most versatile open-weight candidate for general-purpose engineering tasks.\n\n### Cost Concerns for Heavy Use\n- Agent costs spike on output. A model that rambles is an expensive model.\n\n### Community Skepticism\n- There's skepticism among users—r/singularity users have seen enough \"big jump\" releases to ask the obvious question: did capability really move, or did the eval harness get friendlier?\n\n### Recommendations from Real Users\n- For local use, focus on \"niche\" workflows where latency is less critical, such as polishing Whisper voice-to-text outputs or offline classification tasks, rather than real-time agentic coding.\n- If you are hunting the best LLM for coding 2025, watch failure modes, not highlights.

This deliberate, step-by-step process makes them exceptionally proficient at solving complex logic puzzles, mathematical problems, and difficult coding challenges.\n- In evaluations by external experts, o3 makes 20 percent fewer major errors than OpenAI o1 on difficult, real-world tasks—especially excelling in areas like programming, business/consulting, and creative ideation.\n- OpenAI o3 and o4-mini are the most intelligent models OpenAI has released, and they're often more efficient than their predecessors, OpenAI o1 and o3-mini. On the 2025 AIME math competition, the cost-performance frontier for o3 strictly improves over o1.\n\n### O4-mini Performance\n- On the AIME 2025 math competition, O4-mini solved essentially all problems when given the ability to use Python as a scratchpad—scoring 99.5% on AIME 2025 (pass@1) with tool use.

If we prevent the model from representing this direction, it loses its ability to refuse requests.\n\n## Performance Considerations\n\nThere is a performance drop in ablated versions across all benchmarks. The ablation process successfully uncensors models but also degrades the model's quality.(no content)While effective at removing refusals, abliteration typically causes intelligence loss—reduced reasoning capability, increased hallucinations, and degraded instruction-following.

It punches way above its weight class, replaces the old Mistral Nemo as the go-to for mid-range hardware, and when abliterated, loses the \"preachiness\" typical of French models.\n\n## Scale of the Ecosystem\n\nAccording to a 2025 academic study, over 11,000 uncensored LLMs now exist on Hugging Face, with some downloaded over 19 million times.(no content)A large-scale empirical analysis of safety-modified open-weight LLMs found that modified models exhibit substantially higher compliance: while unmodified models complied with only 19.2% of unsafe requests, modified variants complied at an average rate of 80.0%.\n\n## Deployment Tools\n\nOllama is an open-source local LLM runtime that simplifies running large language models on personal computers.

Qwen3-Coder (Top Pick)**\nThe Qwen3-Coder collection features a family of open-source, coding-specialized large language models from Alibaba's Qwen team, released in mid-2025. These LLMs are instruct-tuned variants optimized for agentic coding tasks like code generation, debugging, tool calling, and browser automation. They support massive contexts (up to 262K tokens natively, extendable to 1M via YaRN) and include both dense and MoE architectures.\n\n- Key variants include small sizes like Qwen3-Coder-0.5B through 7B (dense), a Large 30B-A3B MoE variant (30.5B total params, 3.3B active), and a Huge 480B-A35B-Instruct (480B total, 35B active MoE).\n- Even Q4 quantization retains 95%+ of benchmark scores; smaller models are surprisingly capable for everyday coding.\n\n**2. Codestral-22B**\nA focused, permissive 22B code model with 32K context and strong repo-level performance. Good balance of quality vs. latency; easy to run locally (and available via Ollama).\n\n**3. DeepSeek-Coder-V2**\nA specialist model from the DeepSeek family, specifically fine-tuned for code generation, completion, and reasoning. It supports over 300 programming languages and has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on coding benchmarks.\n\n**4. Mistral 7B**\nDelivered performance far exceeding their resource requirements. Released under the permissive Apache 2.0 license, which makes it suitable for commercial use without restrictions. It shows strong capabilities in code generation and multiple European languages.\n\n### Hardware Considerations\n\nThe most important question to ask before downloading a model is not \"Which is best?\" but \"Which can I run?\" The primary bottleneck for running LLMs is Video RAM (VRAM) on your GPU, or unified memory on Apple Silicon.(no content)Quantized 7B–13B models like Llama 3, Mistral, and Phi-3 usually deliver the best balance of speed and quality on laptops, especially on Apple Silicon or NVIDIA GPUs.\n\n### Quantization Recommendations\n\nStart with Q5_K_M or Q4_K_M to get the largest model to run efficiently.\n\n### Why Ollama?\n\nOllama is the most developer-friendly local LLM runner for 2025. It's free, private, and fast for 7B–13B models—ideal for prototyping and secure workflows.\n\nKey benefits include:\n- Data Privacy: Your proprietary code, algorithms, and sensitive data never leave your machine. Cost Control: It's free. Running models locally eliminates all per-token API fees and subscription costs. Offline Capability & Speed: Models run without an internet connection, and you get instantaneous, low-latency responses.\n\n### Quick Start Commands\n\n```bash\nollama run qwen3-coder:7b\nollama run codestral\nollama run deepseek-coder:33b\nollama run mistral:7b-instruct\n```\n\nTip: Prefer vLLM or SGLang for long-context coding and higher throughput; use Ollama for dead-simple desktop setups.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0072eba8-7c67-4067-9359-2027dd8b54e9","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:47:01.976Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"best local LLM for coding 2025 ollama comparison speed quality","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Pv1kyArAdSVNra7JEGDZDR","content":[{"title":"Choosing the Best Ollama Model for Your Coding Projects: A 2025 Developer's Guide | CodeGPT","url":"https://www.codegpt.co/blog/choosing-best-ollama-model"},{"title":"Best Ollama Models 2025: Performance Comparison Guide","url":"https://collabnix.com/best-ollama-models-in-2025-complete-performance-comparison/"},{"title":"Top 10 Best Ollama Models for Developers in 2025","url":"https://collabnix.com/best-ollama-models-for-developers-complete-2025-guide-with-code-examples/"},{"title":"5 Open-Source Coding LLMs You Can Run Locally in 2025","url":"https://www.labellerr.com/blog/best-coding-llms/"},{"title":"Best Local LLMs for Offline Use in 2026: A Complete Comparison","url":"https://iproyal.com/blog/best-local-llms/"},{"title":"Best Local LLMs For Coding","url":"https://www.mslinn.com/llm/7900-coding-llms.html"},{"title":"10 Best Open-Source LLM Models (2025 Updated): Llama 4, Qwen 3 and DeepSeek R1","url":"https://huggingface.co/blog/daya-shankar/open-source-llms"},{"title":"[2026] Best LLMs for Coding Ranked: Free, Local, Open Models","url":"https://nutstudio.imyfone.com/llm-tips/best-llm-for-coding/"},{"title":"Best Local LLM for Coding in 2025 | LocalLLM.in","url":"https://localllm.in/blog/best-local-llm-for-coding-2025"},{"title":"Is Ollama the Best Local LLM Runner in 2025?

Simple tasks cost under $0.25, but complex workflows consume credits faster. Each Teams user gets $40/month in credits, but if your Agent is building and testing autonomously for hours, you can burn through credits quickly.\n\n## Real-World Cost Examples\n\nFor a 500-developer team: GitHub Copilot Business faces $114k in annual costs, the same team on Cursor's business tier would pay $192k, while Tabnine Enterprise would exceed $234k.(no content)Token-based models create interesting cost dynamics. Light users might spend $5-20 monthly, while intensive users can easily reach $100-300 monthly costs. The challenge lies in predicting usage patterns.(no content)For API usage, OpenAI's API pricing can add approximately $12,000 annually for teams consuming an average of 1 million tokens per developer per month.\n\n## Key Considerations\n\nWith token-based pricing, each response and every follow-up prompt to fix bugs or tweak styling eats into the token quota. If the AI's output is off or incomplete, users may burn through thousands of tokens (maybe 50K or more), costing a significant chunk of their monthly plan.(no content)As the AI coding assistant market has matured, comparing tools has become increasingly difficult — some tools charge per token, others per message, and yet another gives you a credit system with variable costs.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5dedb43c-0399-4442-a809-61335eee633a","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:47:36.466Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"AI coding assistant cost comparison per task token usage 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01UycujwHgjs1YRquLXHy6Qw","content":[{"title":"Pricing AI Coding Agents: Why Pay-Per-Token Won't Last","url":"https://cosine.sh/blog/ai-coding-agent-pricing-task-vs-token"},{"title":"AI coding assistant pricing 2025: Complete cost comparison (GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Tabnine & more)","url":"https://getdx.com/blog/ai-coding-assistant-pricing/"},{"title":"2025s Best AI Coding Tools: Real Cost, Geeky Value & Honest Comparison - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/stevengonsalvez/2025s-best-ai-coding-tools-real-cost-geeky-value-honest-comparison-4d63"},{"title":"AI Development Tools Pricing: GitHub Copilot vs Claude Code vs Cursor 2025 | Vladimir Siedykh","url":"https://vladimirsiedykh.com/blog/ai-development-tools-pricing-analysis-claude-copilot-cursor-comparison-2025"},{"title":"The AI coding tools pricing battle.

In evaluations it handled complex workflows with fewer dead-ends.(no content)Opus 4.5 delivered an impressive refactor spanning two codebases and three coordinated agents. It was very thorough, helping develop a robust plan, handling the details and fixing tests—a clear step forward from Sonnet 4.5.(no content)Opus 4.1 excels at advanced coding, long-horizon planning, sophisticated analysis, and agentic workflows that require multi-step reasoning across extended context windows of up to 200,000 tokens.\n\n### Cost Considerations\nClaude Opus 4.5 costs approximately 67% less than Opus 4.1 ($5/$25 vs $15/$75), but still more than Sonnet 4.5.
