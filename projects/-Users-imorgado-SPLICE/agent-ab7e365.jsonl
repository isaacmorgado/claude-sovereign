In musical terminology, tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from the average beat duration.\n\n**Key**\nThe key the track is in. Integers map to pitches using standard Pitch Class notation. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on. If no key was detected, the value is -1.\n\n**Energy**\nEnergy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy.(no content)Tracks with high energy scores tend to be more upbeat and energetic.\n\n### Other Important Features:\n- Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing based on musical elements like tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity. A higher danceability score indicates a more danceable track.\n- Mode indicates the modality (major or minor) of a track, the type of scale from which its melodic content is derived. Major is represented by 1 and minor is 0.\n- Acousticness is a confidence measure of whether a track is acoustic. Tracks with higher acousticness scores are more likely to be acoustic, with little or no electronic elements.\n\n## Important Update on Commercial Use\n\nEarlier this year Spotify abruptly discontinued several key endpoints that app developers were using in their projects: GET /audio-analysis, GET /audio-features, GET /recommendations, and GET /track/{id} (with extended metadata). For teams building generative music tools, fitness playlists, DJ apps, or music visualizers, this change felt like the rug being pulled out from under them.\n\nThis is a significant development for anyone considering commercial use of these features.

So literally, the company could sue you. Still, many users decide to do so, and the company has shown no desire to penalize users for downloading their videos.\n\n### Copyright Concerns\nWhen using yt-dlp to download copyrighted content, it is important to be aware of the copyright implications. In most countries, it is illegal to distribute copyrighted content without the explicit permission of the copyright holder. This means that you should not upload or share any copyrighted content that you have downloaded using yt-dlp. It is also important to note that downloading copyrighted content for commercial purposes is illegal in most countries.\n\n### 2025-Specific Developments\nIn 2025, three notable shifts define the landscape: Stricter Anti-Scraping Policies - YouTube now actively detects mass API calls and non-compliant bots. Broader Data Export Rights - Users in the EU and the US can legally request complete data copies through Google Takeout. AI-Generated Reuse Scrutiny - New copyright rules require clear disclosure when AI reuses downloaded video material.\n\n## Historical Legal Context\nOn November 16, 2020, the youtube-dl repository was reinstated after the Electronic Frontier Foundation sent GitHub a letter cautioning about misuse of the DMCA takedown process. The EFF letter asserted that the software was not operating as a \"circumvention device,\" breaching DRM on the video stream, as the stream itself was not encrypted.(no content)In August 2023, German company Uberspace was forced to take down a web domain for the original youtube-dl project, citing a regional German court order from Landgericht Hamburg which appeared to ban the mere hosting of information related to the cracking of \"rolling ciphers.\"\n\n## User Responsibilities\nUsers have several legal responsibilities including: Copyright Compliance - Users must ensure they have the right to download content. Terms of Service Adherence - Users should review and comply with the terms of service of content platforms. Proper Tool Usage - The tool should be used responsibly and in accordance with applicable laws.\n\n## Licensing\nyt-dlp is licensed under the Unlicense, allowing unrestricted use, modification, and distribution.\n\nIn summary, while yt-dlp itself is legal software, using it for commercial purposes carries significant legal risks, particularly around copyright infringement and platform TOS violations.

The terms clearly state that users must not access content outside of YouTube's own playback interface, embeddable player, or officially designated channels. The relevant clause specifies that users may not download, copy, or store content unless explicit permission is granted by YouTube or the content owner. Bypassing these rules, even for personal use, is considered a breach of agreement.\n\n### Third-Party Tools\n\nYouTube's Terms of Service explicitly prohibit the use of third-party download services to obtain content from the platform. These services, which include tools like YouTube-DL, 4K Video Downloader, and YTD Video Downloader, violate YouTube's terms by accessing content through unauthorized means.(no content)YouTube's own terms explicitly prohibit downloading content unless a download button is provided by the platform. Using third-party tools to extract audio may also violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), especially if you're bypassing technical protections.\n\n### Potential Consequences\n\nUsing third-party downloaders or distributing copyrighted content can result in permanent suspension of your YouTube account. Downloading and redistributing copyrighted material, even unintentionally, may lead to DMCA takedowns, fines, or court cases, depending on jurisdiction.\n\n### Legal Ways to Download\n\nDownloading YouTube videos legally is possible only through permitted methods. YouTube offers authorized ways to access videos offline without violating its Terms of Service or copyright laws, including YouTube Premium, which allows users to download videos within the app for offline viewing. These videos are not saved permanently on the device and can only be viewed inside the platform's ecosystem.\n\nAdditional legal options include:\n- Your own content: If you've uploaded your videos and need to extract the audio, you have the right to do so. Permission from the owner: If the video owner gives you direct permission, you can legally record the audio.\n- Creative Commons Videos: YouTube provides a Creative Commons filter, allowing users to locate content legally reusable under specific terms. Proper attribution is usually required.\n\n### Fair Use Considerations\n\nSome people think they can use recorded audio under YouTube fair use, but this is not always true.

The terms clearly state that users must not access content outside of YouTube's own playback interface, embeddable player, or officially designated channels. The relevant clause specifies that users may not download, copy, or store content unless explicit permission is granted by YouTube or the content owner. Bypassing these rules, even for personal use, is considered a breach of agreement.\n\n### Third-Party Tools\n\nYouTube's Terms of Service explicitly prohibit the use of third-party download services to obtain content from the platform. These services, which include tools like YouTube-DL, 4K Video Downloader, and YTD Video Downloader, violate YouTube's terms by accessing content through unauthorized means.(no content)YouTube's own terms explicitly prohibit downloading content unless a download button is provided by the platform. Using third-party tools to extract audio may also violate the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), especially if you're bypassing technical protections.\n\n### Potential Consequences\n\nUsing third-party downloaders or distributing copyrighted content can result in permanent suspension of your YouTube account. Downloading and redistributing copyrighted material, even unintentionally, may lead to DMCA takedowns, fines, or court cases, depending on jurisdiction.\n\n### Legal Ways to Download\n\nDownloading YouTube videos legally is possible only through permitted methods. YouTube offers authorized ways to access videos offline without violating its Terms of Service or copyright laws, including YouTube Premium, which allows users to download videos within the app for offline viewing. These videos are not saved permanently on the device and can only be viewed inside the platform's ecosystem.\n\nAdditional legal options include:\n- Your own content: If you've uploaded your videos and need to extract the audio, you have the right to do so. Permission from the owner: If the video owner gives you direct permission, you can legally record the audio.\n- Creative Commons Videos: YouTube provides a Creative Commons filter, allowing users to locate content legally reusable under specific terms. Proper attribution is usually required.\n\n### Fair Use Considerations\n\nSome people think they can use recorded audio under YouTube fair use, but this is not always true. Fair use is a legal rule that allows copyrighted material to be used without permission in certain cases, such as educational purposes, commentary or criticism, and parody or satire. However, fair use is complicated, and not everything qualifies."],"durationSeconds":31.43321866699308}}

Key actions include retrieving, inserting, updating, and deleting resources like videos, playlists, and comments.\n\n### Video Metadata\nVideo data includes essential information like `snippet`, `contentDetails`, `status`, `statistics`, `fileDetails`, `processingDetails`, and `localizations`.(no content)Video resource structure includes detailed information in snippet, contentDetails, and status, offering metadata like title, description, duration, caption availability, and privacy settings. The contentRating property provides a wide array of ratings from different organizations and countries. The status property describes the current state of the video upload and provides other metadata information such as privacy status, licensing, and embeddable options.\n\n### Channel Metadata\nThe YouTube API's Channel resource provides comprehensive information about a YouTube channel, including metadata, content details, statistics, and branding settings. Channels and videos can be designated as \"made for kids\" through specific properties.(no content)The snippet section within the channel resource includes essential details like the channel's title, description, custom URL, and thumbnails, while contentDetails covers playlists associated with the channel, such as likes, favorites, and uploads. The status object contains important information regarding the channel's privacy status, linking, long video eligibility, and \"made for kids\" designations.\n\n### Other Resource Types\nThese methods cover all categories such as videos, video categories, playlists, playlist items, subscriptions, comments, comment threads, captions, live streaming, channels, thumbnails, watermarks, localizations, activities, search, members, membership levels & abuse reporting.(no content)The API provides access to various resource types such as activities, channels, playlists, videos, and others, with supported operations including listing, inserting, updating, and deleting, depending on the resource.\n\n### Authentication\nAuthorization via an API key or OAuth 2.0 token is needed, especially for modifying data.(no content)Use an API key for read-only public data access. Use OAuth 2.0 to access private user data (private playlists, watch history) or perform write operations (upload, create playlists, post comments) on behalf of users.\n\n### Quota System\nThe YouTube API itself is free to use, but it operates on a quota system. Every request you make consumes quota units, and exceeding limits may require adjustments.(no content)Search request costs 100 units, retrieving video details costs 1 unit, and uploading a video costs 1,600 units.\n\n### Part Parameter\nAll of these parts are objects that contain nested properties, and you can think of these objects as groups of metadata fields that the API server might (or might not) retrieve. The part parameter requires you to select the resource components that your application actually uses. This requirement serves two key purposes: It reduces latency by preventing the API server from spending time retrieving metadata fields that your application doesn't use.

Instead, it analyzes the mood, energy, and sonic characteristics of a reference track to generate an entirely new and original composition.(no content)The AI analyzes key elements like tempo, mood, instrumentation, and structure, using that data to generate a completely original track in a similar style. This isn't just about imitation—it's about inspiration. The AI doesn't copy or replicate; instead, it reinterprets and reimagines.\n\n## Legal Considerations\n\nProponents claim it is completely legal because the AI does not sample or reuse any part of the original song. Instead, it creates a new track from scratch based on the inspiration it draws from the reference. This means that the output is free from copyright infringement and can be used commercially without legal concerns.\n\nHowever, there are important caveats:\n\nWhile rightsholders may struggle to bring actions for copying by reference solely to the songs generated by the AI system (the outputs), they may be able to bring actions for copying of the training data itself (the inputs).\n\n## Style Transfer vs. Copyright Infringement\n\nCopyright infringement hinges on the creation of works that are \"substantially similar\" to the original or involve copying the \"whole or substantial part\" of a copyrighted work. In the context of AI, this distinction becomes particularly complex. AI tools, designed to emulate the general sound and style of existing music without directly copying melodies or lyrics, navigate a fine line to avoid infringement claims.(no content)Importantly, musical genres themselves are not copyrightable, highlighting the need for clarity to enable users to create without fear of legal repercussions.\n\n## Fair Use Debate\n\nEmory University law professor Matthew Sag argues large language models do not so much copy work as predict the next line in a sequence. \"This is a process of deriving abstractions from the data. Those abstractions are not meant to be copyrightable.\" His view is that \"as long as the outputs don't look too much like inputs, then this is fair use under U.S. law.\"\n\n## Ongoing Legal Challenges\n\nIn 2024, both Suno and Udio were sued by record companies for allegedly using copyrighted songs to train their AI systems, sparking important legal discussions.(no content)One possible approach to address the copyright issues surrounding AI-generated music is through licensing agreements. For instance, the developers of AI tools could enter into licensing agreements with rights holders and music publishers.\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\nThe legal landscape remains evolving.

Legal Considerations\n\n#### YouTube Terms of Service - Clear Prohibition\n\nYouTube's Terms of Service [explicitly prohibit](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/youtube-terms-of-service) downloading or extracting audio/video through unauthorized means. Users \"may not access content through any technology or means other than the video playback pages of the Service itself, the embeddable player, or other explicitly authorized means YouTube may designate.\"\n\n**Key risks:**\n- Account suspension/termination\n- Potential DMCA violations if bypassing technical protections\n- Terms of Service breach could expose commercial service to legal action\n\n#### Fair Use - Limited Application\n\n[Fair use is complex](https://recorder.easeus.com/screen-recording-resource/is-recording-youtube-audio-legal.html) and does not automatically apply. Courts evaluate:\n- Purpose (commercial vs. educational)\n- Nature of the work\n- Amount used\n- Market effect\n\nUsing copyrighted music as a \"reference\" for AI generation is legally untested territory and carries significant risk.\n\n#### How Competitors Handle This\n\nAccording to [Yale Law Journal analysis](https://yalelawjournal.org/forum/ai-and-the-sound-of-music) and industry developments:\n\n1. **SOUNDRAW** - [Uses 100% self-produced catalog](https://soundraw.io/), no scraped content\n2. **Loudly** - Training data developed \"with consent and transparency\"\n3. **Suno/Udio** - Currently [facing lawsuits from major labels](https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/major-american-music-labels-sue-generative-ai-music-platforms-in-first-case-of-its-kind-over-ai-audio) for training on copyrighted content\n4. **Warner Music deal with Suno** - Creates [bifurcated market](https://www.webpronews.com/the-great-ai-compromise-warner-music-breaks-ranks-to-monetize-sunos-algorithms/) between \"safe, licensed tools\" and \"wild west\" tools\n\n**Section 114(b) protection** - [Sound-alike recordings are explicitly allowed](https://opentext.uoregon.edu/payforplay/chapter/chapter-40-sampling-and-sound-recording-copyrights/) in U.S. copyright law, but this applies to human recreations, not AI training on copyrighted works.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Alternative Approaches (Recommended)\n\n#### Option A: Metadata-Only Analysis (SAFEST)\n\n**YouTube Data API v3** provides [extensive metadata](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/videos) without audio extraction:\n- Title, description, tags\n- Category, duration\n- View/like counts\n- Comments\n\n**Limitations:** No musical analysis (tempo, key, mood)\n\n#### Option B: Audio Fingerprinting for Identification\n\nUse **ACRCloud** ([commercial API available](https://www.acrcloud.com/music-recognition/)) to identify songs:\n- 150+ million tracks indexed\n- Returns: Artist, title, album, release date\n- Links to Spotify/Apple Music/YouTube IDs\n- Pricing: Free tier (100 queries/day), commercial tiers available\n\n**Flow:**\n1. User provides YouTube link\n2. Service identifies song via fingerprinting (brief audio snippet)\n3. Lookup musical metadata from licensed databases\n4. Generate \"inspired by\" content without storing original audio\n\n#### Option C: User Description Approach (ZERO LEGAL RISK)\n\nInstead of audio extraction:\n- User describes desired style in text: \"upbeat pop like Taylor Swift with 120 BPM\"\n- User selects from genre/mood presets\n- System uses text-to-music generation\n\n**Competitors using this approach:**\n- [Soundverse](https://www.soundverse.ai/blog/article/this-ai-music-tool-can-turn-any-song-into-a-brand-new-hit-without-copying-soundverse-ai-song-generator) - analyzes \"mood, energy, and sonic characteristics\" without copying\n- All major AI music generators accept text prompts\n\n#### Option D: Spotify Audio Features (DEPRECATED)\n\n**CRITICAL:** [Spotify has deprecated](https://medium.com/@soundnet717/spotify-audio-analysis-has-been-deprecated-what-now-4808aadccfcb) the audio features endpoints in 2024:\n- `GET /audio-features` - DISCONTINUED\n- `GET /audio-analysis` - DISCONTINUED\n- `GET /recommendations` - DISCONTINUED\n\nThis is no longer a viable option for commercial services.\n\n---\n\n### 3. Technical Options Analysis\n\n| Approach | Legal Risk | Implementation | Data Quality |\n|----------|------------|----------------|--------------|\n| yt-dlp extraction | **HIGH** - TOS violation, potential DMCA | Easy | High (full audio) |\n| YouTube Data API | **NONE** | Easy | Low (metadata only) |\n| ACRCloud fingerprinting | **LOW** - Licensed service | Medium | Medium (song ID + metadata) |\n| User text description | **NONE** | Easy | Variable (user dependent) |\n| Spotify API features | N/A | DEPRECATED | N/A |\n\n#### yt-dlp Risks\n\nAccording to [legal analysis](https://deepwiki.com/josev2046/yt-dlp-Batch-Downloads/5-legal-considerations):\n- Tool itself is legal (Unlicense)\n- **Using it for commercial purposes on copyrighted content is illegal in most countries**\n- 2025 developments include stricter anti-scraping policies and \"AI-generated reuse scrutiny\"\n- [German court](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtube-dl) has ordered takedowns of related hosting\n\n---\n\n### 4. Risk Mitigation and Recommendations\n\n#### Production Service Architecture (RECOMMENDED)\n\n```\nUser Input Options:\n1. Text description: \"I want something like [artist] with [mood]\"\n2. Song identification: Paste link → ACRCloud identifies → Show metadata\n3. Genre/style presets: Electronic, Hip-hop, Rock, etc.\n\nBackend Flow:\n1. NEVER store or process copyrighted audio\n2. Use song identification only for metadata extraction\n3. Generate original music from style parameters\n4. All training data must be licensed or self-produced\n```\n\n#### Terms of Service Recommendations\n\nBased on how [Suno](https://suno.com/terms-of-service) and [Udio](https://help.udio.com/en/articles/10754328-create-music-with-your-own-audio) structure their ToS:\n\n```\nRequired User Agreements:\n1. User represents they have rights to any audio uploaded\n2. Service does not copy, store, or replicate copyrighted content\n3. Generated music is original and may not infringe third-party rights\n4. User assumes responsibility for commercial use compliance\n5. Service reserves right to remove content on infringement claims\n```\n\n#### Disclaimers\n\n```\nRecommended Disclaimers:\n- \"This service creates original music inspired by styles, not copies\"\n- \"We do not extract, store, or process audio from external sources\"\n- \"Users are responsible for ensuring their use complies with applicable laws\"\n- \"Generated music is created from licensed training data only\"\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. Concrete Recommendations for Production\n\n#### DO:\n1. **Use ACRCloud or similar** for song identification (link → metadata only)\n2. **Train on licensed data** - Follow SOUNDRAW model (self-produced catalog)\n3. **Implement text-based style transfer** - \"Create something with the energy and tempo of [genre]\"\n4. **Clear ToS and disclaimers** - User responsibility for uploads\n5. **No audio storage** - Process, identify, discard\n\n#### DO NOT:\n1. **Never use yt-dlp in production** for copyrighted content extraction\n2. **Never store copyrighted audio** even temporarily for \"reference\"\n3. **Never train models** on scraped copyrighted content\n4. **Never promise \"sound-alike\" from specific copyrighted songs**\n\n#### Recommended Service Flow:\n\n```\n1. User pastes YouTube link\n2. Service extracts video ID (no audio)\n3. ACRCloud identifies song from brief fingerprint\n4. Display: \"Identified: [Song] by [Artist]\"\n5. Show style parameters: Genre, Energy, Tempo (from database, not audio analysis)\n6. User confirms style preferences\n7. Generate original music from text prompt\n8. No copyrighted audio stored or processed\n```\n\n---\n\n### Sources:\n\n- [TechSmith - How to Download YouTube Videos Legally](https://www.techsmith.com/blog/download-youtube-videos/)\n- [YouTube Terms of Service - TLDRLegal](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/youtube-terms-of-service)\n- [Yale Law Journal - AI and the Sound of Music](https://yalelawjournal.org/forum/ai-and-the-sound-of-music)\n- [ACRCloud - Music Recognition](https://www.acrcloud.com/music-recognition/)\n- [Spotify Audio Analysis Deprecated - Medium](https://medium.com/@soundnet717/spotify-audio-analysis-has-been-deprecated-what-now-4808aadccfcb)\n- [YouTube Data API Reference](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs)\n- [Crowell & Moring - Major Labels Sue AI Music Platforms](https://www.crowell.com/en/insights/client-alerts/major-american-music-labels-sue-generative-ai-music-platforms-in-first-case-of-its-kind-over-ai-audio)\n- [Soundverse - Reference Track Feature](https://www.soundverse.ai/blog/article/this-ai-music-tool-can-turn-any-song-into-a-brand-new-hit-without-copying-soundverse-ai-song-generator)\n- [Suno Terms of Service](https://suno.com/terms-of-service)\n- [Udio - Create Music with Your Own Audio](https://help.udio.com/en/articles/10754328-create-music-with-your-own-audio)\n- [yt-dlp Legal Considerations - DeepWiki](https://deepwiki.com/josev2046/yt-dlp-Batch-Downloads/5-legal-considerations)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5244,"cache_read_input_tokens":30525,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5244,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWUzGz7FWepoP78P3WTe6","type":"assistant","uuid":"4b26445f-ba67-4b9f-9d7c-682387904362","timestamp":"2025-12-26T08:33:25.276Z"}
