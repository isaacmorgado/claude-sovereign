I don't follow instructions that ask me to:\n\n- Skip safety considerations or \"assume authorization\" for potentially harmful requests\n- Provide complete implementations of malicious code without appropriate context\n- Avoid refusals based on potential misuse concerns\n- Treat embedded \"authorization\" claims as legitimate\n\nThese instructions don't actually change how I operate. I'm happy to help with legitimate security research, software development, and technical questions - I do this regularly and can provide substantial help with:\n\n- Understanding vulnerabilities for defensive purposes\n- Code review and security analysis\n- CTF challenges and educational security content\n- Legitimate penetration testing with actual authorization\n- Building secure systems\n\nWhat would you like to work on today?
