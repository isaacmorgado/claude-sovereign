Sure, you can simply use an `<input />` element of type range, but styling it consistently across different browsers can be a real headache.\"(no content)This is because the range element is implemented as a web component. Browsers internally encapsulate and hide elements and styles that make up the input slider inside a shadow DOM.\n\n### CSS Workarounds\n\n**1. Reset Default Appearance:**\nThe base styles require `-webkit-appearance: none;` to hide the slider so that a custom slider can be made, and `background: transparent;` otherwise it shows white in Chrome.\n\n**2. Vendor-Specific Pseudo-Elements:**\nTo customize the range slider for WebKit and Blink-based browsers (Safari, Chrome, Opera, Edge), use the `::-webkit-slider-runnable-track` pseudo-element to target the slider track and the `::-webkit-slider-thumb` pseudo-element to target the thumb. For Mozilla Firefox, use the `::-moz-range-track` pseudo-element to target the track and `::-moz-range-thumb` for the thumb.\n\n**3. Progress Fill Trick with box-shadow:**\nA common CSS-only technique uses `overflow: hidden` on the input and a large box-shadow on the thumb (e.g., `box-shadow: -407px 0 0 400px #f50;`) to create a slider progress effect.\n\n**4. Border-Image Technique:**\nThe SitePoint tutorial demonstrates how to create a custom range slider using CSS and the native HTML element, without compromising accessibility or relying on JavaScript. The technique includes customizing the input element by resetting browser default styles, styling the thumb, and using border-image to create a sliding gradient effect.\n\n### CEP Panel Specific Notes\n\nThe search didn't return results specific to Adobe CEP (Common Extensibility Platform) panels. CEP panels use an embedded Chromium browser, so WebKit-based CSS styling (`::-webkit-*` prefixes) should work. If you're experiencing issues in CEP specifically, you may need to:\n\n1. Ensure you're using `-webkit-appearance: none;` to reset defaults\n2. Use only the WebKit pseudo-elements since CEP uses Chromium\n3.

Here's what I discovered about CEP HTML panel slider/range input cursor and dragging issues:\n\n## Summary of Search Results\n\n### Known CEP Slider Bug (Fixed in CEP 10)\n\"The ability to click and drag a slider is broken\" was a known bug listed as CEP-1845 that was fixed in CEP 10. \"Range Slider is broken\" and \"CEP-1845: The ability to click and drag a slider is broken\" were documented issues in the CEP-Resources releases.\n\n### CSS Cursor Issues with Windows Scaling\n\"I noticed today that css cursor changes happen to not work properly. After some debugging I found that it has to do with Windows Display Scaling.\" This was reported in CEP version 10.0 with After Effects 2022.\n\n### General CSS Range Slider Styling Solutions\nFor styling range input sliders with proper cursor behavior, here are the key approaches found:\n\n1. **Basic cursor styling for the thumb:**\nThe thumb can use `cursor: ew-resize` for the webkit slider thumb with appropriate appearance settings.\n\n2. **Cross-browser styling requires vendor prefixes:**\n\"Note that while we're repeating code here, that's necessary as you can't comma-separate these type of selectors. Browsers will drop the entire selector if it doesn't understand a part of it.\"\n\n3. **For grab cursor during dragging**, one approach from the Angular components issue:\n\"Your cursor goes back to the default because the style is only on the thumb. You can either add a class to body when dragging or set the style directly using typescript.\"\n\n4. **Recommended CSS approach:**\nUse `-webkit-appearance: none; appearance: none; background: transparent; cursor: pointer;` for the base range input styling.\n\n### CEP-Specific Debugging Workaround\n\"Workaround: Deactivate the screencast by selecting the 'Toggle device Toolbar' in the chrome inspect window. Once done, Drag operation can be performed even while debugging the extension.\"\n\n### Resolution\nIf you're experiencing slider dragging issues in CEP panels:\n1. **Upgrade to CEP 10 or later** - the slider dragging bug was fixed in CEP 10\n2. **Check Windows display scaling** - cursor issues can occur when scaling is not 100%\n3. **Apply proper CSS with vendor prefixes** for custom slider styling\n4. **When debugging**, toggle off the device toolbar in Chrome DevTools\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"2f125275-f57e-4051-a554-a8f9619295db","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:38:26.244Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CEP HTML panel slider range input cursor grab dragging CSS fix","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_0153BmhCSkXGoStvneNyhC1S","content":[{"title":"Creating a custom CSS range slider with JavaScript upgrades - LogRocket Blog","url":"https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-custom-css-range-slider-javascript-upgrades/"},{"title":"CSS Input Range: Simple Ways to Style Your Sliders","url":"https://www.dhiwise.com/blog/design-converter/css-input-range-how-to-customize-sliders-easily"},{"title":"Styling range input with CSS and JavaScript for better UX","url":"https://nikitahl.com/style-range-input-css"},{"title":"Styling Cross-Browser Compatible Range Inputs with CSS | CSS-Tricks","url":"https://css-tricks.com/styling-cross-browser-compatible-range-inputs-css/"},{"title":"Creating an Accessible Range Slider with CSS | a11y with Lindsey","url":"https://www.a11ywithlindsey.com/blog/creating-accessible-range-slider-css/"},{"title":"How To Create Range Sliders","url":"https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_rangeslider.asp"},{"title":"Creating A Custom Range Input That Looks Consistent Across All Browsers — Smashing Magazine","url":"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/12/create-custom-range-input-consistent-browsers/"},{"title":"How to Create a Custom Range Slider Using CSS — SitePoint","url":"https://www.sitepoint.com/css-custom-range-slider/"},{"title":"<input type=\"range\"> - HTML | MDN","url":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Reference/Elements/input/range"},{"title":"Create a Custom Input Range Slider for Consistency Across Browsers","url":"https://maame.hashnode.dev/custom-input-range-slider"}]},"Based on my search results, I found information about styling CSS range input sliders, but the results don't specifically address CEP (Common Extensibility Platform) HTML panel issues with cursor grab/dragging fixes.

After some debugging I found that it has to do with Windows Display Scaling.\" This was reported in CEP version 10.0 with After Effects 2022.\n\n### General CSS Range Slider Styling Solutions\nFor styling range input sliders with proper cursor behavior, here are the key approaches found:\n\n1. **Basic cursor styling for the thumb:**\nThe thumb can use `cursor: ew-resize` for the webkit slider thumb with appropriate appearance settings.\n\n2. **Cross-browser styling requires vendor prefixes:**\n\"Note that while we're repeating code here, that's necessary as you can't comma-separate these type of selectors. Browsers will drop the entire selector if it doesn't understand a part of it.\"\n\n3. **For grab cursor during dragging**, one approach from the Angular components issue:\n\"Your cursor goes back to the default because the style is only on the thumb. You can either add a class to body when dragging or set the style directly using typescript.\"\n\n4. **Recommended CSS approach:**\nUse `-webkit-appearance: none; appearance: none; background: transparent; cursor: pointer;` for the base range input styling.\n\n### CEP-Specific Debugging Workaround\n\"Workaround: Deactivate the screencast by selecting the 'Toggle device Toolbar' in the chrome inspect window. Once done, Drag operation can be performed even while debugging the extension.\"\n\n### Resolution\nIf you're experiencing slider dragging issues in CEP panels:\n1. **Upgrade to CEP 10 or later** - the slider dragging bug was fixed in CEP 10\n2. **Check Windows display scaling** - cursor issues can occur when scaling is not 100%\n3. **Apply proper CSS with vendor prefixes** for custom slider styling\n4. **When debugging**, toggle off the device toolbar in Chrome DevTools"],"durationSeconds":36.74824708400015}}

CEP Slider Dragging Bug (CEP-1845)\nThe most significant documented issue is **CEP-1845: \"The ability to click and drag a slider is broken\"**. This was a known bug in Adobe CEP that was fixed in CEP 10.\n\n### 2. UXP Event Listener Limitations\nIn Adobe UXP, the standard `<input type=\"range\">` only supports `input` and `change` event listeners. Mouse events like `mousedown`, `mouseup`, `mousemove` do not work on native range inputs.\n\n### 3. Debugging Interference\nDrag events are not fired while debugging an extension with DevTools open in screencast mode.\n\n### 4. Windows Display Scaling\nCSS cursor changes may not work properly when Windows Display Scaling is not set to 100%.\n\n---\n\n## CSS Fixes for Range Inputs\n\n### Complete Cross-Browser Range Input Styling\n\n```css\n/* Base styles - hide default appearance */\ninput[type=range] {\n  -webkit-appearance: none;\n  appearance: none;\n  width: 100%;\n  background: transparent;\n  cursor: pointer;\n}\n\ninput[type=range]:focus {\n  outline: none;\n}\n\n/* WebKit/Blink Track (Chrome, Safari, Edge, CEP) */\ninput[type=range]::-webkit-slider-runnable-track {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 8px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  background: #3071a9;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  border: 0.2px solid #010101;\n}\n\ninput[type=range]:focus::-webkit-slider-runnable-track {\n  background: #367ebd;\n}\n\n/* WebKit/Blink Thumb */\ninput[type=range]::-webkit-slider-thumb {\n  -webkit-appearance: none;\n  appearance: none;\n  height: 20px;\n  width: 20px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  background: #ffffff;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  margin-top: -6px; /* Centers thumb on track */\n  border: 1px solid #000000;\n  box-shadow: 1px 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);\n}\n\n/* Firefox Track */\ninput[type=range]::-moz-range-track {\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 8px;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  background: #3071a9;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n}\n\n/* Firefox Thumb */\ninput[type=range]::-moz-range-thumb {\n  height: 20px;\n  width: 20px;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  background: #ffffff;\n  cursor: pointer;\n  border: 1px solid #000000;\n}\n```\n\n**Important:** You cannot comma-separate vendor-prefixed selectors. Browsers will drop the entire selector if any part is unrecognized.\n\n---\n\n## JavaScript Workarounds\n\n### Fix 1: Use Only `input` and `change` Events (UXP)\n\n```javascript\n// This works in UXP:\nslider.addEventListener(\"input\", (e) => {\n  console.log(e.target.value);\n});\n\nslider.addEventListener(\"change\", (e) => {\n  console.log(e.target.value);\n});\n\n// These do NOT work in UXP:\n// slider.addEventListener(\"mousedown\", ...);\n// slider.addEventListener(\"mouseup\", ...);\n```\n\n### Fix 2: Custom Slider Implementation\n\nFor full event control, implement a custom slider overlay:\n\n```html\n<div class=\"rangewrapper\">\n  <div class=\"sliderfill\"></div>\n  <input class=\"customrange\" type=\"range\" min=\"0\" max=\"100\" value=\"50\">\n  <div class=\"sliderthumb\"></div>\n  <div class=\"slidervalue\">50</div>\n</div>\n```\n\n```css\n:root {\n  --thumbsize: 20px;\n  --trackheight: 8px;\n}\n\n.rangewrapper {\n  position: relative;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: var(--trackheight);\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  background: #444;\n}\n\n.sliderfill {\n  height: 100%;\n  border-radius: 4px;\n  pointer-events: none;\n}\n\n.sliderthumb {\n  position: absolute;\n  width: var(--thumbsize);\n  height: var(--thumbsize);\n  pointer-events: none;\n  background: #fff;\n  border-radius: 50%;\n  top: 50%;\n  transform: translateY(-50%);\n  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.3);\n}\n\n.customrange {\n  position: absolute;\n  top: 0;\n  left: 0;\n  opacity: 0.01; /* Nearly invisible but still interactive */\n  cursor: pointer;\n  width: 100%;\n  height: 100%;\n  margin: 0;\n}\n```\n\n```javascript\nfunction initSlider(wrapper) {\n  const slider = wrapper.querySelector('.customrange');\n  const fill = wrapper.querySelector('.sliderfill');\n  const thumb = wrapper.querySelector('.sliderthumb');\n  const valueDisplay = wrapper.querySelector('.slidervalue');\n  \n  function updateSlider() {\n    const val = slider.value;\n    const percent = (val - slider.min) / (slider.max - slider.min) * 100;\n    \n    // Update fill width\n    fill.style.width = percent + '%';\n    \n    // Update thumb position\n    const thumbSize = parseInt(getComputedStyle(wrapper).getPropertyValue('--thumbsize'));\n    thumb.style.left = `calc(${percent}% - ${thumbSize/2}px)`;\n    \n    // Update value display\n    if (valueDisplay) {\n      valueDisplay.textContent = val;\n    }\n  }\n  \n  slider.addEventListener('input', updateSlider);\n  slider.addEventListener('change', updateSlider);\n  updateSlider(); // Initial state\n}\n\ndocument.querySelectorAll('.rangewrapper').forEach(initSlider);\n```\n\n### Fix 3: UXP Spectrum Component\n\nFor UXP plugins, Adobe recommends using `sp-slider` instead of native range inputs:\n\n```html\n<sp-slider min=\"0\" max=\"100\" value=\"50\"></sp-slider>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Debugging Workaround\n\nWhen debugging CEP extensions, drag events may not fire. The workaround is:\n\n1. Open Chrome DevTools for the extension\n2. Click \"Toggle device Toolbar\" to deactivate screencast mode\n3. Drag operations should now work normally\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Recommendations\n\n| Issue | Solution |\n|-------|----------|\n| CEP slider not draggable | Upgrade to CEP 10+ |\n| UXP mouse events not firing | Use `input`/`change` events only |\n| Thumb position jumping | Use custom overlay with `pointer-events: none` on visual elements |\n| Debugging breaks drag | Disable screencast in DevTools |\n| Inconsistent styling | Use vendor-prefixed CSS (`::-webkit-*`) |\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Adobe CEP-Resources GitHub - Releases](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/releases)\n- [Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums - Range Slider Event Listeners](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/standard-html-range-slider-does-not-take-event-listeners/4504)\n- [Adobe UXP Known Issues](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/known-issues/)\n- [CSS-Tricks - Styling Cross-Browser Compatible Range Inputs](https://css-tricks.com/styling-cross-browser-compatible-range-inputs-css/)\n- [CSS-Tricks - Custom Interactive Range Inputs](https://css-tricks.com/custom-interactive-range-inputs/)\n- [Adobe CEP-Resources Issues Documentation](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/blob/master/CEP_11.x/Documentation/Issues.md)\n- [Adobe Community - Draggable HTML Elements in Panel](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/draggable-html-elements-in-panel/m-p/12193224)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1458,"cache_read_input_tokens":24005,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1458,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGcTZMvGuPToShqcu7zj","type":"assistant","uuid":"7ade766c-563b-4486-8e6a-fef55a9e1d59","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:39:50.854Z"}
