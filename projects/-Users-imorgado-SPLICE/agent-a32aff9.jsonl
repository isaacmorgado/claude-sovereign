You will also need the latest build, v2.2.1, of the UXP Developer Tools (UDT) to load, debug, and package your plugins. You can download the UDT through Creative Cloud Desktop.\n\n### Version Information\nPremiere version (v25.6) determines which Premiere DOM APIs are available, while UXP version (v8.1) determines which UXP Core APIs are available. Each Premiere release integrates a specific UXP version. For example, Premiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.\n\n### Key Capabilities\nUXP is a JavaScript-based extensibility platform (ES6/ECMAScript 2015 compliant) that helps you automate, optimize, and extend the capabilities of your favorite Adobe Creative Cloud products. It represents a comprehensive solution that lets you use Web technologies to build new features and tools for Desktop applications.\n\n**Plugin Types:**\nPlugins allow you to create a persistent User Interface that blends seamlessly with the host application (a panel), or an actionable command that runs a predefined function (a command) and can be triggered by the user via menu item.\n\n**API Access:**\nThe API provides access to sequences, tracks, clips, markers, project items, and application settings.(no content)Core UXP functionality includes file system, networking, shell execution, and more.\n\n### Key Differences from ExtendScript/CEP\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread.(no content)UXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over the previous extensibility technology (CEP), where the communication between the extension logic and the host application happened through a bridge (CSInterface). With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment.\n\n### Distribution\nFor those who have been developing alongside Adobe during the beta, if your plugin is polished and ready for distribution, you can now submit it to the Adobe Marketplace for approval.\n\n### Legacy Support\nExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so, through September 2026.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"170b7f60-4596-448c-a0fd-2ad4e2f37ef8","timestamp":"2025-12-26T02:22:39.161Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro UXP API 2025 new capabilities plugins","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01AGyFv8Mm8yeUvVCiognW2f","content":[{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development"},{"title":"Premiere API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"Premiere and UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/"},{"title":"Build your favorite new feature in Premiere Pro","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro UXP Beta — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about Premiere Pro UXP API 2025 capabilities for plugins:\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP API - 2025 Overview\n\n### Major Milestone\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).(no content)UXP is the current extensibility standard for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, supported by a constantly growing set of applications, including Premiere (version 25.6), Photoshop, and InDesign.\n\n### Getting Started Requirements\nTo get started, you need Premiere v25.6 installed.

One of the most frequently cited pain points on Reddit regarding free video editors is the presence of obtrusive watermarks and severe limitations on export quality or duration, with users expressing significant frustration when a large, distracting watermark is permanently burned into their exported videos.\n\n### AI Tool Quality Issues\nMany users on platforms like Reddit express strong dissatisfaction with Runway's performance and pricing, particularly its credit-based system. Free plan users have reported that the service has become \"completely unusable\" and is \"temporarily unavailable\" due to heavy demand. Even paid users complain about \"highway robbery\" and long queue times despite paying for premium plans.(no content)There are also significant quality control issues, with users describing generations as \"utterly random\" and \"terrible\" with \"warped features\" and a constant failure to adhere to prompts.\n\n### Common Editor Software Complaints (Filmora example)\nMany users complain about \"bugs in the software,\" \"random crashes,\" and frustratingly poor customer service. The company is often accused of \"scamming\" customers with a confusing pricing structure that includes a deceptive \"Filmstock\" add-on and a non-truly-perpetual \"perpetual\" license that requires repurchase for major version updates.\n\n### Core Workflow Pain Points\nVideo editing today sits at a crossroads. Creators want professional results, but few have the time—or patience—for overly complex tools and fragmented workflows.(no content)Two long-standing pain points are: editing that feels slow and labor-intensive, and pro-level tools that are often inaccessible to non-experts.(no content)The single biggest pain point for millions of podcasters, educators, and content marketers is the immense time and effort required to edit spoken-word content.\n\n### What Users Want from AI\nUsers want a tool that gets out of their way and allows them to translate their ideas into video format as efficiently as possible. The AI component should act as a helpful assistant, automating tedious tasks and suggesting creative enhancements, thereby making the editing process more enjoyable and less daunting for users of all skill levels.\n\n### AI Automation Limitations\nAI can recognize patterns, but it doesn't understand feeling. It knows where a cut could happen, not where it should.(no content)AI can handle the technical side of editing, but it can't recognize emotion, pacing, or tone. It processes footage through data (e.g., duration, brightness, audio levels), but those metrics don't capture what makes a story connect.\n\n### What's Working in 2025\nSome AI tools have moved well beyond gimmick territory. They're solving real-world post-production challenges: speeding up tedious tasks, improving quality, and unlocking new creative options.(no content)High-end, often tedious tasks—such as noise reduction in audio, complex visual effects like object tracking, or even consistent color grading across multiple clips—are now being automated with a single click.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8da8aae7-592d-4e43-859c-71e1883b877d","timestamp":"2025-12-26T02:22:42.648Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"video editor pain points AI automation frustrations Reddit 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_017HgemuhbcsBPjuxPWmnj9R","content":[{"title":"Reddit's Take: Finding a Free AI Video Editor for Your Projects | ReelMind","url":"https://reelmind.ai/blog/reddit-s-take-finding-a-free-ai-video-editor-for-your-projects"},{"title":"🖼️ Turn Reddit Pain Points into Comic Ads using GPT-4o + Dumpling AI in n8n","url":"https://dumplingai.com/blog/🖼️-turn-reddit-pain-points-into-comic-ads-using-gpt-4o-dumpling-ai-in-n8n"},{"title":"Best AI Video Editing Tools 2025: Complete Creator's Guide & Reviews","url":"https://aitoolanalysis.com/best-ai-video-editing-tools-2025/"},{"title":"Wondershare Filmora V15: Smarter editing powered by AI and built for real creators | Macworld","url":"https://www.macworld.com/article/3016776/wondershare-filmora-v15-smarter-editing-powered-by-ai-and-built-for-real-creators.html"},{"title":"Best AI Video Generator Reddit Users Recommend in 2025","url":"https://www.capcut.com/resource/best-ai-video-generator-reddit"},{"title":"AI Tools for Video Editing That Are Actually Useful In 2025","url":"https://www.redsharknews.com/ai-tools-for-video-editing-that-are-actually-useful-in-2025"},{"title":"Beyond Easy AI Fixes: Identifying Workflow Pain Points and Implementing Solutions for Long-Term Efficiency","url":"https://orrgroup.com/identify-workflow-pain-points-implement-ai-solutions/"},{"title":"Best AI Video Editors 2025: Top 10 Tools for Content Creators & Marketers (Vizard, CapCut, VEED)","url":"https://vizard.ai/blog/the-10-best-ai-video-editors-in-2025-for-creators-and-marketers-popularity-value-and-user-experience"},{"title":"The Uncomfortable Truth About AI Coding Tools: What Reddit Developers Are Really Saying | by Anoop Menon | Oct, 2025 | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@anoopm75/the-uncomfortable-truth-about-ai-coding-tools-what-reddit-developers-are-really-saying-f04539af1e12"},{"title":"8 Reasons AI Video Editing Still Requires a Specialist - Lemonlight","url":"https://www.lemonlight.com/blog/8-reasons-ai-video-editing-still-requires-a-specialist/"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about video editor pain points, AI automation frustrations, and related Reddit discussions in 2025:\n\n## Key Pain Points for Video Editors\n\n### Free/Low-Cost AI Video Editor Frustrations\nUsers on Reddit frequently express frustration with steep learning curves and complex layouts in many video editors.

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level. With UXP, you can build unique tools that integrate with and optimize the most precise, demanding workflows.\n\n### Premiere DOM APIs\n\nPremiere APIs, also called DOM APIs (Document Object Model), give you direct access to Premiere's document model. These APIs let you, among other things: Access and modify projects — sequences, tracks, clips, and markers; Work with media — import files, manage project items; Control playback — set in/out points, control the playhead; Apply effects — add video and audio effects to clips.\n\n### Accessing the API\n\nYou can access the Premiere DOM via UXP by requiring it. From there, you can open documents, modify them, run menu items, and more.(no content)Premiere Pro APIs (aka Document Object Model DOM or OMV) are used to create and modify the application document and content. Premiere DOM is available only as a JavaScript module and should be retrieved on a need basis using require().\n\n### Async vs Sync Behavior\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, blocking the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n## Current Limitations for Track/Clip Manipulation\n\nThere is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks. Premiere Pro no longer includes a keyboard mappable command like Move Clip Up/Down Between Tracks, meaning even UI automation cannot rely on a universal shortcut.(no content)The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin, the right starting point for any future integrations, shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\n## Resources\n\n- **Official UXP Documentation**: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/\n- **Premiere API Reference**: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/\n- **Sample SDK on GitHub**: The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n- TypeScript definitions for Premiere Pro's UXP APIs are now available in Visual Studio Code.(no content)ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported through September 2026, but no further changes or improvements to Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API are planned or scheduled.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"89946e6f-204c-48e9-8d8c-2e03b1a7e79e","timestamp":"2025-12-26T02:23:22.390Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro UXP DOM API sequence track clip manipulation 2025 documentation","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01NTF8yRGGdxH7Z8wvqSj8mv","content":[{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"Premiere API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"Re: Request for Timeline Editing API Support (Clip Track Movement / Flattening)","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115"},{"title":"How to Add Clips to a Sequence Using Premiere Pro UXP API? - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/how-to-add-clips-to-a-sequence-using-premiere-pro-uxp-api/8977"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"Premiere Pro DOM APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/dom-apis/"},{"title":"UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/"}]},"Here's what I found about Premiere Pro UXP DOM API for sequence, track, and clip manipulation in 2025:\n\n## Overview\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform).(no content)The UXP has officially graduated from beta and is now available in Adobe Premiere 25.6.\n\n## Official Documentation\n\nUXP (Unified eXtensibility Platform) is an integration framework built into Premiere and other Adobe Creative Cloud applications.

FireCut's weakness is predictable camera switching based solely on audio volume.\n\n---\n\n## High-Value Feature Opportunities\n\n### 1. AI B-Roll Auto-Insert (HIGH VALUE)\n\n**What it is:** Automatically detect moments needing visual enhancement and insert relevant stock footage or AI-generated B-roll.\n\n**Competitors doing this:** Opus Clip, Submagic, AutoCut, Kapwing\n\n**Implementation approach:**\n- Analyze transcript for keywords/topics\n- Connect to Pexels/Storyblocks API\n- Insert B-roll at detected moments in cut list\n\n**Business value:** HIGH - This is a major differentiator. No current Premiere plugin does this natively within timeline.\n\n**Effort:** 15-20 hours\n\n---\n\n### 2. Speaker Diarization for Smarter Camera Switching (HIGH VALUE)\n\n**What it is:** Use AI to identify who is speaking (not just audio volume) for intelligent multicam switching.\n\n**Why it matters:** FireCut and AutoPod both struggle with overlapping dialogue. Cutback leads here.\n\n**Implementation approach:**\n- Integrate NVIDIA Streaming Sortformer or AssemblyAI diarization\n- Map speakers to camera angles\n- Generate camera switches based on speaker identity, not volume\n\n**Business value:** HIGH - Directly addresses FireCut's main weakness\n\n**Effort:** 10-15 hours (API integration)\n\n---\n\n### 3. Smart Auto-Reframe for Social Platforms (MEDIUM VALUE)\n\n**What it is:** Automatically resize 16:9 content to 9:16/1:1 with AI subject tracking.\n\n**Competitors doing this:** Adobe native (limited), DaVinci Resolve 19, Reframer AI\n\n**Implementation approach:**\n- Use ML object detection for subject tracking\n- Generate reframe keyframes in cut list\n- Apply via UXP DOM APIs\n\n**Business value:** MEDIUM - Standard feature now, but Premiere's native version is slow\n\n**Effort:** 20-25 hours\n\n---\n\n### 4. Generative Extend (Clip Extension) (LOW PRIORITY)\n\n**What it is:** AI-generate additional frames to extend clips.\n\n**Status:** Adobe has this native in Premiere Pro now via Sensei.\n\n**Recommendation:** Skip - Adobe already solved this.\n\n---\n\n### 5. Real-Time Scene Detection + Smart Chapters (MEDIUM VALUE)\n\n**What it is:** Automatically detect scene changes and generate chapter markers.\n\n**Current status:** FireCut does this already.\n\n**Opportunity:** SPLICE can be faster with DOM API approach.\n\n**Effort:** 8-10 hours\n\n---\n\n### 6. Text-Based Editing Interface (HIGH VALUE)\n\n**What it is:** Edit video by editing the transcript text (like Descript).\n\n**Why it matters:** This is Descript's killer feature. Editors love it.\n\n**Implementation approach:**\n- Display transcript with timestamps\n- Allow selection/deletion of text to trigger clip cuts\n- Sync text edits to timeline via builder.js\n\n**Business value:** HIGH - Major UX differentiator\n\n**Effort:** 25-30 hours\n\n---\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP Capabilities Others Aren't Using\n\nBased on the [UXP DOM API documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/):\n\n| Capability | Current Status | Opportunity |\n|------------|---------------|-------------|\n| Async batch transactions | SPLICE uses this | 10-100x faster than competitors |\n| Sequence cloning | SPLICE uses this | Non-destructive editing |\n| Color labels programmatically | SPLICE uses this | Visual organization |\n| Track item in/out manipulation | SPLICE uses this | Frame-accurate cuts |\n| Effect application via API | NOT USED | Auto-apply effects (gain, zoom) |\n| Marker creation | NOT USED | Auto-chapter/scene markers |\n| Project item metadata | NOT USED | Searchable smart tagging |\n\n**Key Limitation:** UXP cannot move clips vertically between tracks. This limits J-cut/L-cut automation.\n\n---\n\n## User Pain Points to Address\n\n| Pain Point | Current SPLICE Solution | Improvement Opportunity |\n|------------|------------------------|------------------------|\n| Watermarks on free tools | N/A (paid product) | Offer generous free tier |\n| Complex learning curves | Preset profiles | One-click \"Just Fix It\" mode |\n| Slow processing | 10-100x faster | Already winning here |\n| Poor accuracy in noise | RMS detection | Add noise gate pre-processing |\n| Credit-based confusion | Hourly billing | Show real-time cost estimate before processing |\n| Crashes/bugs | Needs testing | Premiere 25.6+ runtime validation |\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Roadmap (Priority Order)\n\n### Phase 1: Quick Wins (8-10 hours)\n1. **Chapter/Scene Markers** - Use existing scene detection, add marker creation via UXP\n2. **Effect Auto-Apply** - Add gain normalization, auto-zoom effects to cut list\n\n### Phase 2: Competitive Parity (15-20 hours)\n3. **Speaker Diarization** - Integrate AssemblyAI or Whisper with diarization\n4. **Smarter Multicam** - Speaker-based camera switching vs volume-based\n\n### Phase 3: Differentiation (25-30 hours)\n5. **B-Roll Auto-Insert** - Pexels/Storyblocks integration\n6. **Text-Based Editing UI** - Transcript-driven editing interface\n\n### Phase 4: Platform Expansion (20+ hours)\n7. **Auto-Reframe** - Social media format conversion\n8. **AI Script Suggestion** - Suggest cuts based on content analysis\n\n---\n\n## Business Value Summary\n\n| Feature | Competitive Advantage | Revenue Impact | Effort |\n|---------|----------------------|----------------|--------|\n| Speaker Diarization | Beats FireCut weakness | HIGH | 10-15h |\n| B-Roll Auto-Insert | Unique in Premiere plugins | HIGH | 15-20h |\n| Text-Based Editing | Matches Descript | HIGH | 25-30h |\n| Chapter Markers | Parity with FireCut | MEDIUM | 5h |\n| Auto-Reframe | Standard feature | MEDIUM | 20-25h |\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [FireCut Alternatives - SaaSworthy](https://www.saasworthy.com/product-alternative/45422/firecut-ai)\n- [AutoPod vs FireCut Comparison](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/AutoPod-vs-FireCut/)\n- [Best Multi-cam Editing Plugins - Cutback](https://cutback.video/blog/best-multi-cam-editing-plugins-for-premiere-pro-users)\n- [AI Video Editing Trends 2025 - Vertu](https://vertu.com/ai-tools/ai-video-editing-trends-2025/)\n- [AI Tools Actually Useful in 2025 - RedShark](https://www.redsharknews.com/ai-tools-for-video-editing-that-are-actually-useful-in-2025)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP API](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [UXP Arrives in Premiere - Adobe Blog](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n- [AI B-Roll Generator - Opus Clip](https://www.opus.pro/tools/ai-b-roll-generator)\n- [AutoCut AutoB-Rolls](https://www.autocut.com/en/autobroll/)\n- [Speaker Diarization 2025 - AssemblyAI](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/top-speaker-diarization-libraries-and-apis)\n- [NVIDIA Streaming Sortformer - MarkTechPost](https://www.marktechpost.com/2025/08/21/nvidia-ai-just-released-streaming-sortformer-a-real-time-speaker-diarization-that-figures-out-whos-talking-in-meetings-and-calls-instantly/)\n- [Cutback Multicam Features](https://cutback.video/features/multicam)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1268,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2389,"cache_read_input_tokens":26559,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2389,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWUWBEmP7PyiNdEgv7kBZ","type":"assistant","uuid":"118c8e1d-46af-445f-bfb7-20b2e4325f10","timestamp":"2025-12-26T02:24:48.891Z"}
