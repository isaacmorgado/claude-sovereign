Here's what I learned:\n\n## Roo Code Overview\n\nRoo Code, which was previously recognized as Roo Cline, is an autonomous coding agent powered by artificial intelligence and integrated within Visual Studio Code to boost the efficiency of software development.(no content)Roo Code is an open-source VSCode extension which started as a Fork of Cline.\n\n## Key Capabilities & Features\n\n**Interaction Modes:**\nRoo Code offers a variety of customizable modes, such as Code Mode for routine coding tasks, Architect Mode for designing systems, Ask Mode for posing questions, Debug Mode for resolving issues, and user-defined Custom Modes tailored for specific tasks.\n\n**Core Functionality:**\n- It possesses the ability to directly read and write files in the workspace, run terminal commands, and automate actions in web browsers.\n- It's a coding agent that can make changes directly in the editor you are working on, run terminal commands and integrate with different tools using MCP servers.\n\n**Advanced Features:**\n- Fast Edits - Lightning-fast code modifications with intelligent diff application; Concurrent File Reads - Read multiple files simultaneously for better context; Codebase Indexing - Semantic search across your entire codebase.\n- It incorporates the Model Context Protocol (MCP), which broadens its functionality by allowing integration with various external tools and APIs.\n\n**Customization:**\n- Its capability for adding extra modes and customizing the prompt for the existing ones, which would help customizing the experience.\n- The Roo Code Extension is open source so you can see for yourself exactly what it's doing and we don't use your data for training.\n\n## Limitations\n\n**Token Consumption:**\nRoo Code consumes a great amount of tokens, as it is a BYOK (Bring your own Key) tool. For the features tested, it used around USD 50 in tokens.\n\n**Session Management:**\nIt only supports one session per VSCode window. This limits the amount of parallel tasks it can tackle.\n\n**Performance Variability:**\nPerformance may vary based on the complexity of the codebase, quality of the prompts and the model used for the different modes.\n\nThe tool appears to be actively maintained in 2026, with recent releases including version 3.39.1 (2026-01-08) and 3.39.0 (2026-01-08), indicating ongoing development and improvements.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c48f0557-1b54-4263-8038-dae875ac7d4a","timestamp":"2026-01-10T21:06:22.446Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Roo Code capabilities features limitations 2026","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01S1Bh96gt41wZ8TSHy2YbST","content":[{"title":"Roo Code review: A perspective on AI-powered coding - Qubika","url":"https://qubika.com/blog/roo-code/"},{"title":"Compare Qodo vs. Roo Code in 2026","url":"https://slashdot.org/software/comparison/Qodo-vs-Roo-Code/"},{"title":"Roo Code – The AI dev team that gets things done","url":"https://roocode.com/"},{"title":"Extension Release Notes | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/"},{"title":"Roo Code vs Cline: Best AI Coding Agents for VS Code (2026)","url":"https://www.qodo.ai/blog/roo-code-vs-cline/"},{"title":"Roo Code: A Guide With 7 Practical Examples | DataCamp","url":"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/roo-code"},{"title":"Compare Continue vs. Roo Code in 2026","url":"https://slashdot.org/software/comparison/Continue-vs-Roo-Code/"},{"title":"Roo Code vs Cline: Complete Comparison for Developers 2025 - Openxcell","url":"https://www.openxcell.com/blog/roo-code-vs-cline/"},{"title":"Releases · RooCodeInc/Roo-Code","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/releases"},{"title":"Roo Code Features | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/features/"}]},"I found comprehensive information about Roo Code's capabilities, features, and limitations.

Here are the key findings:\n\n## Common File Editing Errors\n\nFile editing errors in Claude Code appear as \"String to replace not found in file\" or \"File has been unexpectedly modified.\"(no content)These are known issues related to string matching and file state tracking.\n\n## Specific Issues Reported\n\n1. **\"File has been unexpectedly modified\" error**: This bug has been \"quietly ruining the experience\" and \"lately, it's happening more frequently than ever.\"(no content)This is a path + workspace tracking problem inside Claude Code.\n\n2. **Too many edit errors**: Claude makes too many edit file errors, reads files and then makes errors again, and after a few errors, gives up.\n\n3. **VS Code integration issues**: It used to be that when Claude suggested an edit in VS Code, you could see the diff and make changes to it, but now those manual changes are discarded regardless.\n\n4. **Frequent update failures**: Update errors happen even if trying to update immediately after reading with no apparent external modification, making it impossible to edit files reliably.\n\n## User Impact\n\nWhen paying $200/month, and the AI refuses to edit a file, it \"completely kills flow\" which is why users pay for these tools.\n\nThe search results indicate these are well-documented issues in the Claude Code GitHub repository with multiple bug reports and user complaints about the reliability of the file editing functionality."],"durationSeconds":14.97348762500286}}

Now I have comprehensive research. Let me compile this brutal honest comparison:\n\n---\n\n# **BRUTAL HONEST COMPARISON: Roo Code vs Claude Code**\n\n## **TL;DR - Which One Sucks Less?**\n\n**Claude Code** = More powerful, faster, better automation, but **expensive as hell** with predatory usage limits and file editing bugs that kill your flow.\n\n**Roo Code** = Cheaper (BYOK), more control, better for complex multi-file tasks, but **crashes constantly**, burns through tokens like crazy, and context management is broken.\n\n---\n\n## **1. WHAT EACH TOOL ACTUALLY DOES WELL**\n\n### **Claude Code Strengths:**\n\n✅ **Intelligence & Reasoning** - [Claude Opus 4.5 scores 80.9% on SWE-bench Verified](https://dev.to/nodeshiftcloud/claude-4-opus-vs-sonnet-benchmarks-and-dev-workflow-with-claude-code-11fa), first model to break 80%. [Terminal-bench: 59.3%](https://apidog.com/blog/claude-code-vs-codex-cli/), crushing Gemini (54.2%) and GPT (47.6%).\n\n✅ **CLI Automation** - [Scriptable as CLI tool for enterprise workflows](https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases). Can integrate into GitHub Actions, automate PR reviews, documentation generation. [Roo can't match this](https://berryhill.dev/posts/claude-code-versus-roo-code-which-ai-coding-tool-is-right-for-you).\n\n✅ **No Rate Limiting (on CLI)** - [Unlimited usage on API](https://slashdot.org/software/comparison/Claude-Code-vs-Roo-Code/), unlike subscription plans.\n\n✅ **Surgical Code Edits** - [Makes \"surgical, necessary corrections without fluff\"](https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases), reducing bugs.\n\n### **Roo Code Strengths:**\n\n✅ **Multi-Mode System** - [Architect (planning) → Code (execution) → Debug](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/using-modes). [Mode switching prevents scope creep](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/roo-code).\n\n✅ **Model Agnostic (BYOK)** - [Supports OpenRouter, Anthropic, DeepSeek, Gemini](https://arnav.tech/beyond-copilot-cursor-and-claude-code-the-unbundled-coding-ai-tools-stack). Use DeepSeek-R1 and [cut costs by 97%](https://www.qodo.ai/blog/roo-code-vs-cline/).\n\n✅ **Open Source & Customizable** - [Fork of Cline with enhanced features](https://www.qodo.ai/blog/roo-code-vs-cline/). Full transparency.\n\n✅ **Browser Automation** - [Puppeteer-controlled browser with screenshot analysis](https://docs.roocode.com/features/browser-use). Claude Code lacks this.\n\n✅ **Better for Large Multi-File Refactors** - [\"More reliable on large, multi-file changes\"](https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases). [\"Fewer half-finished edits and less agent thrashing\"](https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases).\n\n---\n\n## **2.

[\"Extension crashes VS Code during indexing\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/5857).\n\n❌ **CONTEXT OVERLOAD** - [\"LLM cannot handle multi-file repositories coherently\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/7438). [\"Loads files bigger than context window\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/4186), causes infinite autocondense loops. [\"3-4 minutes for simple requests, then fails\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/7438).\n\n❌ **BURNS TOKENS LIKE CRAZY** - [\"Used ~$50 in tokens for feature testing\"](https://qubika.com/blog/roo-code/).

[\"MCP overhead: ~16k characters even if unused\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/5963).\n\n❌ **BROKEN MCP INTEGRATION** - [\"Versions 3.9.0+ break MCP functionality\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/2273). [\"AI refuses to use MCP tools even when installed\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/5936). [\"MCP section becomes blank\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/10265).\n\n❌ **OVERCOMPLICATED UI** - [\"Buttons everywhere impossible to coordinate\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/7438).

FILE HANDLING & MULTI-FILE OPERATIONS**\n\n### **Claude Code:**\n\n❌ **BROKEN** - [\"File has been unexpectedly modified\"](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/11463), [\"Too many edit errors, AI gives up\"](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/3471)\n\n❌ [\"VS Code diff changes now discarded\"](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/5764)\n\n❌ [\"Update errors even immediately after reading\"](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/5926)\n\n### **Roo Code:**\n\n✅ [\"More reliable on large, multi-file changes\"](https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases)\n\n✅ [Fast Edits with intelligent diff application](https://docs.roocode.com/features/)\n\n✅ [Concurrent file reads](https://docs.roocode.com/features/)\n\n❌ [\"Loads files bigger than context window\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/4186), infinite loops\n\n❌ [\"LLM drowns in multi-file repos\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/7438)\n\n**Winner:** **Roo Code** (when it doesn't crash)\n\n---\n\n## **10. CONTEXT MANAGEMENT & MEMORY**\n\n### **Claude Code:**\n\n❌ [\"Starts every session with zero context\"](https://www.producttalk.org/give-claude-code-a-memory/)\n\n❌ [\"No persistent memory between sessions\"](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/14227)\n\n❌ [200k token limit vs 400k-1M competitors](https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow/issues/377)\n\n❌ [\"Context window overload degrades output quality\"](https://hyperdev.matsuoka.com/p/how-claude-code-got-better-by-protecting)\n\n✅ [Auto-compaction (but kills speed)](https://medium.com/@joe.njenga/claude-code-finally-fixed-its-biggest-problems-stats-instant-compact-and-more-0c85801c8d10)\n\n### **Roo Code:**\n\n❌ [\"Loads files bigger than context window\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/4186), autocondense loops forever\n\n❌ [\"@/folder/ includes ALL file contents, overwhelms context\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/2216)\n\n❌ [\"Context Window Size setting ignored\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/4475)\n\n❌ [\"Cannot add context from another workspace root\"](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/3646)\n\n✅ [File read auto-truncate threshold](https://docs.roocode.com/tips-and-tricks)\n\n**Winner:** **Both suck**, but Claude has better compaction (slower). Roo has more granular control (when it works).\n\n---\n\n## **FINAL VERDICT - WHICH ONE TO USE?**\n\n### **Use Claude Code If:**\n\n- You need **top-tier intelligence** for complex reasoning/debugging\n- You want **CLI automation** for CI/CD workflows\n- You're willing to **pay $200/month** and [pray you don't hit usage limits](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/claude_devs_usage_limits/)\n- You can tolerate [file editing bugs](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/11463) that kill flow\n\n### **Use Roo Code If:**\n\n- You want **BYOK cost control** ([97% cheaper with DeepSeek](https://www.qodo.ai/blog/roo-code-vs-cline/))\n- You need **browser automation**\n- You prefer **multi-mode planning → execution**\n- You can tolerate [frequent crashes](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/3640) and [token burns](https://qubika.com/blog/roo-code/)\n\n### **Use Both (The Power User Stack):**\n\n[**Real devs use both**](https://nikuscs.com/blog/10-ai-workflow-with-claude-code-roocode-gpt/):\n1. **Claude Code** for deep reasoning, automation, CLI tasks\n2. **Roo Code** for planning (Architect mode), browser tests, multi-file refactors\n3. Switch based on task type\n\n---\n\n## **THE BOTTOM LINE:**\n\n**Neither tool is perfect.** Claude Code is more powerful but has predatory pricing and file editing bugs. Roo Code is more flexible but crashes constantly and burns tokens.\n\n**The 2026 reality:** [The \"Unbundled Era\"](https://arnav.tech/beyond-copilot-cursor-and-claude-code-the-unbundled-coding-ai-tools-stack) means developers mix tools based on task - write in Cursor, route via DeepInfra to DeepSeek for drafting, use Claude Code for architecture review.\n\n**Stop looking for \"one tool to rule them all.\"** Both suck in different ways. Pick your poison based on what you hate less.\n\n---\n\n## **Sources:**\n\n- [Compare Claude Code vs. Roo Code in 2026](https://slashdot.org/software/comparison/Claude-Code-vs-Roo-Code/)\n- [Roo vs. Claude Code: Best AI for Large, Complex Codebases](https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases)\n- [Claude devs complain about surprise usage limits • The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/claude_devs_usage_limits/)\n- [Critical User Experience Issues with Roo · Issue #7438](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/7438)\n- [Claude Code Performance Issues and Optimization | ClaudeLog](https://claudelog.com/faqs/claude-code-performance/)\n- [Roo Code Docs | Roo Code Documentation](https://docs.roocode.com/)\n- [Claude 4: Opus vs Sonnet, Benchmarks, and Dev Workflow](https://dev.to/nodeshiftcloud/claude-4-opus-vs-sonnet-benchmarks-and-dev-workflow-with-claude-code-11fa)\n- [Claude Code Pricing: Is the $200/mo Plan Worth It?](https://userjot.com/blog/claude-code-pricing-200-dollar-plan-worth-it)\n- [Beyond Copilot, Cursor and Claude Code: The Unbundled Coding AI Tools Stack](https://arnav.tech/beyond-copilot-cursor-and-claude-code-the-unbundled-coding-ai-tools-stack)\n- [Roo Code vs Cline: Best AI Coding Agents for VS Code (2026)](https://www.qodo.ai/blog/roo-code-vs-cline/)\n- [Claude Code vs. Roo Code Comparison](https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Claude-Code-vs-Roo-Code/)\n- [Programming with AI using Claude Code, Roo Code & Cursor](https://nikuscs.com/blog/10-ai-workflow-with-claude-code-roocode-gpt/)\n- [Stop Repeating Yourself: Give Claude Code a Memory](https://www.producttalk.org/give-claude-code-a-memory/)\n- [How Claude Code Got Better by Protecting More Context](https://hyperdev.matsuoka.com/p/how-claude-code-got-better-by-protecting)\n- [Roo Code review: A perspective on AI-powered coding](https://qubika.com/blog/roo-code/)\n- [All GitHub Issues cited above]"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1926,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4739,"cache_read_input_tokens":44227,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4739,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWzP3oLmrvZdVQYrbrrUg","type":"assistant","uuid":"44b31594-6ac4-4fa6-aacf-ff8d28782af6","timestamp":"2026-01-10T21:10:25.028Z"}
