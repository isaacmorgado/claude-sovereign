Now I have the context. Let me create a comprehensive report of the error handling and timeout issues I found:\n\n## Error Handling, Timeout Logic, and Potential Race Conditions Analysis\n\nBased on my thorough examination of the SPLICE codebase, here are the critical findings regarding error handling, try-catch blocks, timeout logic, and initialization issues:\n\n### 1. **CEP Panel Initialization - Critical Timeout Handling Issues**\n\n**Location**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/config.js` (lines 82-378)\n\n**Issue**: The JSX bridge initialization has **multiple timeout configurations** but potential **race condition vulnerabilities**:\n\n```\nJSX_TIMEOUTS = {\n    QUICK: 5000,        // 5s  - simple checks\n    DEFAULT: 30000,     // 30s - most operations\n    LONG: 120000,       // 2m  - export operations\n    CRITICAL: 300000    // 5m  - complex timeline operations\n}\n```\n\n**Problems**:\n- The `JSX.evalScript()` function (line 263) uses a timeout mechanism but has a **\"late callback\" bug** - callbacks arriving after timeout are ignored but logged as warnings (line 284)\n- No exponential backoff when retries fail\n- The `_verifyJSXReady()` function (line 208) has a hardcoded 10-second timeout that could be too aggressive for slow systems\n- Missing promise rejection handling in several initialization chains\n\n---\n\n### 2. **Sequence Detection - Race Condition in checkSequenceOpen()**\n\n**Location**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/main.js` (lines 482-530)\n\n**Critical Issues**:\n- The function calls `jsx.call('checkSequenceOpen')` with **retry logic** but the retry count is hardcoded to 2 attempts (line 487)\n- **No timeout protection** on individual retry attempts - only the JSX bridge level timeout\n- **Race condition potential**: Between the JSX call completing and the result being checked, Premiere Pro's sequence state could change\n- Error storage at `window.spliceState.lastSequenceCheckError` but no automatic recovery mechanism\n\n**Code Flow**:\n```\nfor (let attempt = 0; attempt <= retries; attempt++) {\n    try {\n        const result = await jsx.call('checkSequenceOpen');  // No timeout here\n        // Race condition window: sequence could be closed between check and response\n    } catch (error) {\n        // Only logs, doesn't exponentially backoff\n    }\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 3. **Premiere Pro API Readiness - Timeout with No Graceful Fallback**\n\n**Location**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/main.js` (lines 450-473)\n\n**Issue**: The `waitForPremiereReady()` function:\n- **No exponential backoff** - uses same 500ms delay between all retries\n- Calls `jsx.call('checkPremiereReady')` which itself can timeout\n- If all 10 attempts fail, logs warning but **doesn't trigger a recovery UI state**\n- The status message is set at line 262 but never auto-reset\n\n**Error Logging**:\n```\nconsole.error('[SPLICE] waitForPremiereReady: Failed after 10 attempts');\nreturn false;\n// But initialization continues - no abort!\n```\n\n---\n\n### 4. **Backend Server - Missing Error Context in Critical Paths**\n\n**Location**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-backend/server.js` (lines 837-881)\n\n**Issues**:\n- `startServer()` function catches errors but only logs and exits (line 878-879)\n- No timeout on critical initialization steps:\n  - `usageTracking.initDatabase()` - no timeout\n  - `referralService.initReferralTables()` - no timeout\n  - `licenseService.initLicenseTables()` - no timeout\n- Music worker startup failure is logged as warning but **silently continues** (line 855)\n- If Redis connection hangs, the entire server startup can hang indefinitely\n\n**Code**:\n```javascript\ntry {\n    await usageTracking.initDatabase();  // Could hang forever\n    await referralService.initReferralTables();  // No timeout\n    await licenseService.initLicenseTables();  // No timeout\n} catch (err) {\n    console.error('[SPLICE] Failed to start server:', err);\n    process.exit(1);  // Only option: hard exit\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n### 5. **Error Handler Middleware - Good Error Handling but Missing Timeouts**\n\n**Location**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-backend/middleware/errorHandler.js` (lines 325-389)\n\n**Good Practices**:\n- Comprehensive error classification with `ErrorCodes` enum\n- Proper error sanitization in production\n- Async handler wrapper properly catches exceptions\n- Consistent JSON response format\n\n**Missing Pieces**:\n- No request timeout enforcement at middleware level\n- Late responses after client disconnect aren't detected\n- No circuit breaker for cascading failures\n\n---\n\n### 6. **JSX Bridge Connection Check - Silent Failures**\n\n**Location**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/main.js` (lines 423-441)\n\n**Issue**: The `checkJSXConnection()` function:\n- Only called once during initialization (line 255)\n- If it fails, only sets an error in the UI (line 431)\n- **No retry mechanism** for temporary network issues\n- Doesn't block subsequent operations that depend on JSX\n\n---\n\n### 7. **Music Module - Unhandled Promise Rejections**\n\n**Files**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/music.js` and `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-backend/workers/musicWorker.js`\n\n**Issue**: The music generation pipeline has:\n- BullMQ job queue without timeout enforcement\n- No circuit breaker when Replicate API fails\n- Worker initialization errors are logged but don't prevent operation\n- Missing exponential backoff on failed jobs\n\n---\n\n### 8. **Critical: Missing Centralized Timeout Management**\n\n**Problem Identified**: There is **no centralized timeout manager** that enforces maximum wait times across:\n- JSX bridge calls\n- Database initialization\n- Redis connections\n- External API calls (Stripe, OpenAI, Replicate)\n\n**Result**: Long-running operations can hang indefinitely because:\n1. Individual services lack timeout enforcement\n2. No watchdog timer at server level\n3. No automatic circuit breaker pattern\n4. No graceful degradation when services are unavailable\n\n---\n\n### 9. **Race Condition Detection & Mitigation - Present but Limited**\n\n**Found in**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/main.js` (lines 145-157)\n\n**Existing Mitigation**:\n```javascript\nlet operationLock = {\n    locked: false,\n    async acquire() {\n        while (this.locked) {\n            await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 50));\n        }\n        this.locked = true;\n    },\n    release() {\n        this.locked = false;\n    }\n};\n```\n\n**Problem**: Only prevents concurrent GO button clicks, **doesn't protect**:\n- Simultaneous JSX calls from different modules\n- Sequence state changes during checks\n- Token refresh race conditions\n- Database transaction conflicts\n\n---\n\n### 10. **Global Error Handlers - Good Coverage but Incomplete**\n\n**Location**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/config.js` (lines 1862-1880)\n\n**Coverage**:\n- `window.addEventListener('error', ...)` - catches uncaught exceptions\n- `window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection', ...)` - catches promise rejections\n- Error log persisted to localStorage with 50-entry limit\n\n**Gaps**:\n- No timeout on error logging itself (localStorage write could hang)\n- No automatic error reporting to backend\n- No circuit breaker pattern when errors spike\n\n---\n\n## Summary of Findings\n\n| Issue | Severity | Root Cause | Impact |\n|-------|----------|-----------|--------|\n| CEP JSX timeout race conditions | **CRITICAL** | No promise rejection after timeout | Panel can hang indefinitely |\n| Sequence detection no timeout | **HIGH** | Missing timeout on JSX calls | Loading stuck state |\n| Premiere Pro API timeout with no fallback | **HIGH** | No retry strategy or recovery | Panel shows \"not ready\" forever |\n| Database initialization hangs | **HIGH** | No timeouts on init calls | Server won't start |\n| No centralized timeout manager | **HIGH** | Missing watchdog pattern | Any service can hang entire system |\n| Music worker errors not handled | **MEDIUM** | Silent failure on worker init | Music features unavailable without notice |\n| JSX connection checked only once | **MEDIUM** | No reconnection logic | Can't recover from temporary JSX failures |\n| Sequence state race condition | **MEDIUM** | No atomic read/check/act pattern | Detected sequence might be closed when used |\n\nAll findings are in **READ-ONLY** analysis format with file paths and line numbers for reference."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":2,"cache_creation_input_tokens":5229,"cache_read_input_tokens":90247,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":5229,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CX6ibhxww27BCZTkK2b1e","type":"assistant","uuid":"8e85d6b0-e3f4-488e-937f-5262977cad03","timestamp":"2026-01-14T05:28:36.435Z"}
