Now I have a clear picture. Let me create a comprehensive report of my findings:\n\n## Summary: Network/API Blocking Issues During CEP Panel Initialization\n\nI've identified several critical network and async operations that could be blocking or timing out during initialization. Here are the key findings:\n\n### **Primary Blocking Operations During Startup**\n\n#### 1. **Credits Fetch on Panel Load (CRITICAL)**\n**File**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/credits.js` (lines 326-342)\n\n```javascript\nasync function initCredits() {\n    const credits = await fetchCredits();  // BLOCKS until network responds\n    updateCreditDisplay(credits);\n    \n    creditsRefreshInterval = setInterval(async () => {\n        const refreshedCredits = await fetchCredits();\n        updateCreditDisplay(refreshedCredits);\n    }, 5 * 60 * 1000);\n}\n```\n\n**Issues**:\n- Called during `DOMContentLoaded` (main.js line 200)\n- Makes a GET request to `/credits` endpoint (line 46)\n- Has 120-second timeout but blocks UI thread until response\n- Retry logic adds another 30-second timeout on 401 errors (line 72)\n- No fallback - panel shows \"Retry\" or \"Login\" badge until this completes\n\n**Potential Hang Points**:\n- Network timeout (120s default from `SPLICE_CONFIG.FETCH_TIMEOUT`)\n- Backend unreachable or slow response\n- Token validation delay (lines 39-44 call `ensureValidToken()`)\n- Token refresh if token expired (lines 55-100)\n\n#### 2. **JSX Bridge Initialization with Retries**\n**File**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/config.js` (lines 101-172)\n\n```javascript\njsx.init: function () {\n    if (this._initPromise) return this._initPromise;\n    this._initPromise = this._initWithRetry();  // Async retry chain\n    return this._initPromise;\n}\n\n_initWithRetry: async function () {\n    const maxRetries = 5;\n    const baseDelay = 200;\n    \n    for (let attempt = 1; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {\n        const success = await this._tryInit(attempt);\n        if (success) {\n            await this.loadHostScript();      // Network/async call\n            const jsxReady = await this._verifyJSXReady();  // 10s timeout\n            // ...\n        }\n        const delay = baseDelay * Math.pow(2, attempt - 1);\n        await this._delay(delay);  // Exponential backoff\n    }\n}\n\n_verifyJSXReady: async function () {\n    return new Promise((resolve) => {\n        const timeout = setTimeout(() => {\n            resolve(false);\n        }, 10000);  // 10-second timeout\n        // ...\n    });\n}\n```\n\n**Issues**:\n- Up to 5 retry attempts with exponential backoff (200ms → 3200ms)\n- Total worst-case delay: ~7 seconds for JSX initialization alone\n- Each retry adds delay before next attempt\n- Happens BEFORE credits fetch in initialization order (main.js line 247-255)\n- Can block panel even if Premiere Pro API is not responding\n\n#### 3. **Premiere Pro API Readiness Check**\n**File**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/main.js` (lines 257-265)\n\n```javascript\nconst premiereReady = await waitForPremiereReady(10, 500);\n```\n\n**Async dependency chain**:\n- `waitForPremiereReady()` (line 450): Makes up to 10 attempts with 500ms delays\n- Total worst-case: 5 seconds\n- Calls `jsx.call('checkPremiereReady')` which relies on JSX bridge being ready\n\n#### 4. **Backend Health Check (Optional)**\n**File**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/config.js` (lines 1036-1062)\n\n```javascript\nfunction initOfflineDetection() {\n    // ...\n    offlineCheckInterval = setInterval(async () => {\n        try {\n            const response = await fetchWithTimeout(\n                `${getBackendUrl()}/health`,\n                { method: 'GET' },\n                5000\n            );\n        } catch {\n            // ...\n        }\n    }, 30000);  // Every 30 seconds\n}\n```\n\n**Issues**:\n- Called during initialization (main.js line 205)\n- First health check runs immediately (infinite loop safety)\n- 5-second timeout per check\n- Can block if backend is unreachable\n\n### **Initialization Order Diagram**\n\n```\nDOMContentLoaded\n├─ Cache UI elements\n├─ Load settings (sync, fast)\n├─ Initialize UI handlers (mostly sync)\n├─ JSX Bridge Init (async, ~7s worst-case)\n│  ├─ _initWithRetry() (5 retries × 200-3200ms)\n│  ├─ loadHostScript() \n│  └─ _verifyJSXReady() (10s timeout)\n├─ checkJSXConnection() (async)\n├─ waitForPremiereReady() (async, ~5s worst-case)\n│  └─ Retries: up to 10 × 500ms delays\n├─ SpliceCompatibility.detectPremiereFeatures() (async)\n└─ initCredits() (async, BLOCKS UI)\n   └─ fetchCredits() (120s timeout to /credits endpoint)\n      ├─ ensureValidToken() (may trigger token refresh)\n      └─ On 401: refreshAccessToken() (30s timeout to /auth/refresh)\n```\n\n### **Configuration Affecting Timeouts**\n\n**File**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/config.js` (lines 43-50)\n\n```javascript\nconst SPLICE_CONFIG = {\n    VERSION: '6.0.3',\n    BACKEND_PROD: 'https://splice-api-production.up.railway.app',\n    BACKEND_DEV: 'https://127.0.0.1:3847',\n    FETCH_TIMEOUT: 120000,  // 2 minutes - very long!\n    RETRY_ATTEMPTS: 3,\n    RETRY_DELAY: 1000\n};\n```\n\n**JSX Timeouts**:\n```javascript\nconst JSX_TIMEOUTS = {\n    QUICK: 5000,        // 5s\n    DEFAULT: 30000,     // 30s\n    LONG: 120000,       // 2m\n    CRITICAL: 300000    // 5m\n};\n```\n\n### **Blocking Network Endpoints Called During Init**\n\n1. **`/credits`** - User credit balance (required on load)\n2. **`/auth/refresh`** - Token refresh if expired (conditional, on 401)\n3. **`/health`** - Backend health check (optional, periodic)\n\n### **Error Logging Infrastructure**\n\n**File**: `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/config.js` (lines 1745-1880)\n\nComprehensive error logging is in place:\n```javascript\nlogError(module, operation, error, context)  // Line 1762\ngetErrorLog()   // Line 1811\nclearErrorLog() // Line 1823\nformatErrorLog() // Line 1835\n```\n\nGlobal error handlers capture unhandled exceptions and promise rejections (lines 1865-1880).\n\n### **Root Causes of Initialization Hangs**\n\n1. **Backend unreachable**: 120-second timeout waiting for `/credits`\n2. **Token refresh loop**: If refresh fails, subsequent retries pile up\n3. **JSX bridge unresponsive**: 5 retries × exponential backoff before giving up\n4. **Premiere API not ready**: 10 retries × 500ms delays\n5. **Cascade effect**: Each async operation waits for the previous one (awaits are sequential, not parallel)\n\n### **Recommendations**\n\n1. **Parallelize non-dependent operations** - JSX init and credits fetch don't depend on each other\n2. **Reduce timeout values** - 120s is excessive for CEP panels; consider 15-30s\n3. **Implement non-blocking credits loading** - Fetch in background with \"Loading...\" state\n4. **Add UI timeout warnings** - Show \"Still loading...\" message after 5 seconds\n5. **Reduce retry attempts** - 5 JSX retries × exponential backoff adds 7+ seconds\n\n### **Files to Review**\n- `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/main.js` (initialization sequence)\n- `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/credits.js` (blocking fetch on load)\n- `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-cep/panel/js/config.js` (timeouts and JSX bridge)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":5,"cache_creation_input_tokens":3019,"cache_read_input_tokens":71945,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":3019,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CX6iabRGfLEN49eXrir6x","type":"assistant","uuid":"a9fc3420-ea71-4e8b-b32f-9b3dfa2ca6e2","timestamp":"2026-01-14T05:28:19.643Z"}
