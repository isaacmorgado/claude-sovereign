This single feature saves users hours on every single edit, because doing this step manually is not only a huge time-sink, but also extremely repetitive and boring.(no content)To do a quick clean-up, go to Remove silences, pick a Silence cutting tightness setting (loose, default, tight) and click \"Go!\" FireCut will analyze your video, find silences, and cut them automatically right in your Premiere Pro sequence.(no content)Basic mode offers one-click operation with 1 main setting: cutting tightness. If you want some short gaps before and after silences in the result, choose a loose cut. If you prefer a fast-paced video with very sharp cuts, pick a tight cut.\n\n### Jump Cuts / J-Cuts\nAdding a 1-10 frames offset makes cuts smoother. Cuts in the video can often appear \"jumpy\" especially if you have a lot of them. Adding a slight offset where the audio comes in earlier can make the cuts feel smoother, creating a subliminal effect of making the video \"follow\" the audio.(no content)J-cuts only have 1 setting (as part of the review screen in Remove silences > Advanced mode): Offset - the number of frames by which the cut between the audio and video will be offset. A number greater than 0 will cause the audio to be cut earlier than the video by that many frames. Leave this at 0 if you don't want J-cuts.\n\n### Auto Zoom Features\nAdding zoom-in at key moments in the video is a popular way of adding some motion to single-camera setups. This FireCut feature uses AI to figure out these key moments in your video, and adds zooms automatically on a new video track using Adjustment Layers.(no content)Zoom frequency lets you decide how often FireCut should add a zoom. Low frequency is for slow-paced (typically long-form) content, adding ~1 zoom per minute. The middle (default) setting adds ~2 to 4 zooms per minute. High frequency is for fast-paced (typically short-form) content, adding ~7 zooms per minute.(no content)The Animated setting controls whether to gradually zoom in with an animation, or add a sharp zoom cut without an animation. If animated, this applies keyframes to the Adjustment Layers that are added. Animation duration controls the length of the animation, with a good starting point being 0.2 to 0.5 sec.\n\n### Platform Support\nFireCut is a well-known plugin which was initially released for Premiere Pro. It uses AI to automate the time-taking tasks in a routine video editing workflow. Recently, FireCut released a DaVinci Resolve version.(no content)It works with Adobe Premiere Pro 2022+ on Windows and MacOS.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"72d55166-d9d0-4477-a3c1-498d9ab621d7","timestamp":"2025-12-26T02:22:41.385Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"FireCut silence removal jump cuts auto zoom features","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Kp25joz59Cd1K8T8W682KN","content":[{"title":"Remove silences | FireCut","url":"https://learn.firecut.ai/features/remove-silences"},{"title":"FireCut - Your Lightning-Fast AI Video Editor","url":"https://firecut.ai/features/remove-silences"},{"title":"Cut Silence From Video | Auto Remove Filler Words & Bad Takes","url":"https://www.timebolt.io/"},{"title":"Add zooms | FireCut","url":"https://learn.firecut.ai/features/add-zooms"},{"title":"J-cuts | FireCut","url":"https://learn.firecut.ai/features/remove-silences/j-cuts"},{"title":"Jump cut video app | Automatically Remove Silence","url":"https://www.timebolt.io/Home"},{"title":"FireCut Reviews in 2025","url":"https://sourceforge.net/software/product/FireCut/"},{"title":"The One DaVinci Resolve Plugin That Saves Me Hours on Every Project!","url":"https://firecut.ai/blog/the-one-davinci-resolve-plugin-that-saves-me-hours-on-every-project/"},{"title":"Cut the Fluff: FireCut's Filler Word Removal Feature","url":"https://firecut.ai/blog/cut-the-fluff-firecuts-filler-word-removal-feature/"},{"title":"FireCut - Is This The Best AI Video Tool in 2025? 🏆","url":"https://www.bestaitools.com/tool/firecut/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about FireCut's features for silence removal, jump cuts, and auto zoom:\n\n## FireCut Features Overview\n\n### Silence Removal\nRemove silences in FireCut helps you clean up your raw footage by automatically finding and deleting all the silence portions / dead spaces.

Increase to switch more often (as soon as another speaker becomes louder than the current speaker), or decrease to switch less often.\n\n**Cutaways:** Cutaways are intentional cuts to non-speakers made to keep your video interesting. The \"Max shot duration\" is the limit of how long FireCut should show any given clip. If this threshold is exceeded, FireCut will add a cutaway to one of the other video tracks to help keep viewers engaged.(no content)The \"Cutaway shot duration\" setting determines how long each cutaway should be.\n\n### How It Works\nTo edit a podcast automatically with FireCut, go to \"Multi-track\", tag your video and audio tracks to the correct speakers, and click \"Analyze\". Analyzing your video only takes a few seconds.(no content)The tool lets you identify which video tracks correspond to which audio tracks; you can label the audio tracks by speaker names. It listens to each audio track separately and decides which one to focus on at any given moment, then picks the corresponding video track to show on-screen.\n\n### Additional Notes\nThis feature follows audio loudness rather than the words being spoken, so it works on non-English audio as well.(no content)One reviewer noted that FireCut switches cameras based on audio volume, so the edits follow a predictable rhythm. You'll often see the same wide shot or two-person angle repeating, which can make the final cut feel a little repetitive.\n\n### Pricing\nFireCut's Basic plan starts at $11/month for silence removal.

This folder is scanned for videos which are then tagged automatically with FireCut's AI. You can also add/modify tags yourself for better control.\n\n### B-Roll Frequency Settings\nSimilar to the frequency in the \"Add zooms\" feature, this lets you decide how often you want a B-roll clip to be placed in your sequence.\n\n## Chapter Detection & Markers\n\nDividing your timeline into chapters can be very helpful. When you're close to a final cut, chapter detection can give you markers that you can export as timestamps for YouTube (so YouTube can mark them as chapters in the video), and can even generate pretty motion graphics clips you can show at the start of each chapter.(no content)You can also use it early in the process to put markers on your timeline (e.g. to mark things like \"Introduction\", \"Topic 1, 2, 3, ...\", \"Sponsor segment\", \"Conclusion\") for reference while you edit your video. These are just like any other markers and can be moved around and edited.(no content)The plugin transcribes the video and automatically generates chapters based on the transcription. Users can then review, adjust, and add markers for each chapter. The chapters can be copied and pasted into a text editor and then directly into a YouTube video description for easy navigation.\n\n### Highlight Markers\nFireCut adds red chapter markers named \"FC Highlight\" at the suggested start/end times. You can review, move, add or delete highlights, then generate new sequence(s). Optional features include re-frame to 9:16, add captions, find B-roll, and auto-generate descriptions.\n\n## Overall Capabilities\n\nFirecut is described as an automatic AI video editing tool that can remove silences, add cap cut style captions, remove repetitions, and filler words, add b-roll clips from stock libraries, and add AI chapters to the project.(no content)The plugin can analyze scripts, identify keywords, and automatically place relevant B-roll footage from stock libraries into the timeline.

Smaller values create excessive cuts at natural speech breaks.\n\n**Padding:** Default recommendation is \"250ms on start AND 250ms on end\" to preserve word boundaries and create breathing room between clips.\n\n**Cutting Algorithm Options:**\n- Original: Most reliable but slower, suitable for sequences under 10 minutes with fewer than 50 silences\n- Rapid: Faster alternative for 10-30 minute sequences with 50-100 silences\n- Turbo: Experimental fastest option for sequences 30+ minutes with 100+ silences\n\n**J-cuts Offset:** Creates audio-video timing variations by offsetting video clips while maintaining silence cut positions.\n\n## Usage Tips\n- Test settings on 5-minute samples before processing full sequences\n- Avoid creating 500+ cuts (causes Premiere Pro slowdown)\n- Don't work in the timeline during processing\n- Use Advanced mode for large projects","durationMs":9715,"url":"https://learn.firecut.ai/features/remove-silences"}}

Projects may have more than 1,000 cuts, which can cause significant lag.\n\n### Key Observations from Users\n\n1. **High-end hardware doesn't prevent the issue**: Even users with powerful systems (RTX 4090, i9 14900K processor, 64 GB of RAM) have experienced unusable lag after using FireCut to cut out silences.\n\n2. **Playback settings don't help**: Users have tried putting playback resolution down to 1/4, but still experience lag issues.\n\n3. **Plugin behavior may cause issues**: Users report that manual cutting with individual video files works fine, suggesting the plugin causes the issues. The plugin creator mentioned it \"recreates the footage except with cuts,\" which may be duplicating everything.\n\n4. **Multiple video sources compound the problem**: Having multiple video sources (e.g., 3 1080p sources consolidated together) combined with the plugin's cuts can exacerbate the lag.\n\n### Potential Solutions (from FireCut's own blog)\n\nOne potential solution is resetting the workspace layout, as a \"buggy\" workspace layout might be the root cause. The process involves selecting \"reset to saved layout\" to fix potential GUI problems.(no content)Another fix involves checking audio configuration, as there may be an input set incorrectly causing the lag.

The closest match in the results was **Adobe Firefly**, which does have TTS capabilities. If FireCut is a different product (perhaps a video editing plugin or extension), I would need to perform a more targeted search to find information about it."],"durationSeconds":17.438032332997768}}

It analyses each audio track separately, which means you can let FireCut detect the best threshold for each track automatically, or you can specify a threshold to use. Whenever your audio falls below this threshold, FireCut will treat it as a silence and mute it.\n\n### Find Music Feature\nFireCut can automatically suggest and insert background music for your video — tailored to the mood, genre, and content of your sequence. You can also manage which YouTube channels are whitelisted for music usage in your projects, ensuring you have the right permissions and access to music tracks.(no content)The Find Music feature has two modes: Automatic and Manual. FireCut transcribes your selected sequence (either Full Sequence or your In/Out Scope), and music results appear below—you can preview each track and insert it into your timeline with one click.\n\n### Silence Removal Feature\nFireCut also has silence guidance audio tracks that allow you to specify which audio tracks you want FireCut to listen to for silences. Whenever all of these tracks are silent, that portion of the sequence will be marked for cutting.\n\n### Note on Audio Ducking\nBased on the search results, FireCut does not appear to have a dedicated \"audio ducking\" feature specifically for automatically lowering background music when speech is detected. The search results show that competitors like Wisecut offer features like AI audio ducking, but FireCut's audio features focus more on silence detection, muting, and automatic music insertion rather than traditional audio ducking functionality.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b787a9b0-ac45-4650-a0aa-001982c7f37e","timestamp":"2025-12-26T02:24:57.947Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"FireCut background music audio ducking features","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_016QgUpmVpMtyciqKJ9SefiR","content":[{"title":"Audio Ducking Definition - Final Cut Pro Explained","url":"https://www.tella.com/definition/audio-ducking"},{"title":"Auto Ducking Definition - Final Cut Pro Explained","url":"https://www.tella.com/definition/auto-ducking"},{"title":"How to Do Automatic Audio Ducking in Final Cut Pro X[2025]","url":"https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/automatic-audio-ducking-in-fcpx.html"},{"title":"Multi-track audio muting | FireCut","url":"https://learn.firecut.ai/features/multi-track/multi-track-audio-muting"},{"title":"Find music | FireCut","url":"https://learn.firecut.ai/features/find-music"},{"title":"Mastering Audio Ducking in Final Cut Pro - Will Chidlow","url":"https://willchidlow.com/2020/02/21/mastering-audio-ducking-in-final-cut-pro/"},{"title":"Remove silences | FireCut","url":"https://learn.firecut.ai/features/remove-silences"},{"title":"What is Audio Ducking and How to Do It in Music Production","url":"https://www.izotope.com/en/learn/what-is-audio-ducking"},{"title":"Top FireCut Alternatives in 2025","url":"https://topai.tools/alternatives/firecut"},{"title":"Multi-track video editing | FireCut","url":"https://learn.firecut.ai/features/multi-track/multi-track-video-editing"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about FireCut and audio ducking features:\n\n## FireCut Audio Features\n\nFireCut offers a multi-track audio muting feature that disables quiet audio in selected tracks to remove background noise, by listening to each track separately.(no content)This feature is designed to make cuts in existing audio clips wherever there is silence and mute the newly-created portion of silent clip.

It adds red chapter markers named \"FC Highlight\" at the suggested start/end times.

Turn on Enhanced accuracy to get better timing accuracy for the highlights.\n\n### Vertical Video Reframing\n\nFor vertical export, re-frame to 9:16; use Auto Reframe for speed, Custom for control.(no content)You can export these highlights into new sequences, reframe them to vertical video (9:16), add captions based on your selected preset, find B-roll from their premium Storyblocks collection, and generate descriptions with AI for posting to social media — all in a single click.\n\n### Use Case\n\nIf you're currently making YouTube long-form content and you want better audience reach, you need to create shorts from that content and post it to YouTube Shorts, Instagram Reels and TikTok. FireCut helps you find the moments in your video with the most potential for virality. You can then export these highlights into their own videos for posting to short-form platforms.\n\n### About FireCut\n\nFireCut is an AI-powered video editing tool for Premiere Pro, enabling users to remove silences, filler words, and repetitions, add zooms, chapters, captions, and b-roll.(no content)FireCut was founded in 2023 to help creators and video editors save time by getting to their first cut faster.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"34c3b44f-a09e-40ac-b355-bfcc4b6afeb7","timestamp":"2025-12-26T02:25:01.790Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"FireCut create highlights clips shortform vertical video reframe","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01GBZ4hvDxPPjun9vdBVYRhE","content":[{"title":"Create highlights | FireCut","url":"https://learn.firecut.ai/features/create-highlights"},{"title":"FireCut - Your Lightning-Fast AI Video Editor","url":"https://firecut.ai/features/highlights"},{"title":"Insider Tips: Quickly Reframe Vertical Video in Final Cut - Frame.io Insider","url":"https://blog.frame.io/2024/09/18/insidert-tips-reframe-vertical-video-in-final-cut-pro-fcpx/"},{"title":"Find B-roll | FireCut","url":"https://learn.firecut.ai/features/find-b-roll"},{"title":"Top 5 CapCut Alternatives","url":"https://firecut.ai/blog/top-5-capcut-alternatives/"},{"title":"Adjust framing with Smart Conform in Final Cut Pro for Mac - Apple Support","url":"https://support.apple.com/guide/final-cut-pro/adjust-framing-with-smart-conform-ver26664d93f/mac"},{"title":"How to Create Vertical Videos for YouTube Shorts: Grab Viewers Attention","url":"https://www.capcut.com/resource/vertical-videos-for-youtube-shorts"},{"title":"Firecut Plugin Overview: AI Tool for Premiere Pro Editing YouTube Summary Powered by Sider","url":"https://sider.ai/create/video/ai-video-shortener/explore/65e5f581-58ae-4126-a131-1908622d8d1e"},{"title":"FireCut | Adobe Video Partner Program","url":"https://www.adobevideopartner.com/partners/firecut/"},{"title":"FireCut AI: Your Lightning-Fast AI Video Editor | Product Hunt","url":"https://www.producthunt.com/products/firecut-ai"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about FireCut's features for creating highlights, clips, and short-form vertical video:\n\n## FireCut - Create Highlights Feature\n\nFireCut's \"Create highlights\" feature finds the most engaging moments in your sequence and turns them into short, ready-to-share clips.

Execute cuts\n\n**Settings:**\n| Setting | Description | Default/Recommended |\n|---------|-------------|---------------------|\n| Silence Threshold | dBFS level for silence detection | -30 dBFS |\n| Minimum Silence Duration | Prevents cutting between words | 750ms |\n| Padding (Start) | Buffer before speech | 250ms |\n| Padding (End) | Buffer after speech | 250ms |\n| Guidance Audio Tracks | Which tracks to monitor | User-selectable |\n\n**Cutting Algorithms:**\n- **Original**: Most reliable, slower. For <10 min, <50 silences\n- **Rapid**: Faster. For 10-30 min, 50-100 silences\n- **Turbo**: Experimental fastest. For 30+ min, 100+ silences\n\n**J-Cuts (Beta):**\n- Offset: 1-10 frames where audio cuts earlier than video\n- Creates smoother transitions between cuts\n\n---\n\n### 2. Filler Word Removal\n\n**Detected Words:**\n- \"um\", \"uh\", \"umm\", \"uhh\", and similar hesitation sounds\n\n**Actions:**\n- Mark words for removal\n- Place markers only (for manual review)\n- Directly cut from timeline\n\n**Limitations:**\n- Beta status - may miss some detections\n- Struggles with long silences, music, or sound effects\n- Best results after removing repetitions first\n\n---\n\n### 3. Repetition/Take Detection\n\n**Purpose:** Finds when speaker repeats phrases (multiple takes) and lets you select the best one\n\n**Basic Mode:** Automatic optimal sensitivity\n\n**Advanced Mode Settings:**\n| Setting | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Minimum Phrase Size | Min words to count as repetition |\n| Tolerance | 0% = exact match, 80% = loose match (more false positives) |\n| Search Radius | How far to look for matching phrases |\n| Extend Last Occurrence | How to determine end point (sentence end/longest/phrase size) |\n\n**Workflow:**\n1. Click detected repetition to preview\n2. Select preferred take\n3. Confirm to delete all other instances\n\n**Note:** Only detects consecutive repetitions (not separated by other content)\n\n---\n\n### 4. Profanity Detection & Bleeping\n\n**Censoring Methods:**\n- **Mute**: Silences profanity words\n- **Bleep**: Mutes and overlays with sound\n\n**Bleep Sounds:**\n- Beep (classic)\n- Quack\n- Dolphin\n- Ahooga\n\n**Customization:**\n- Allow list (words to ignore)\n- Block list (additional words to flag)\n- Individual word selection/deselection\n\n**Language Support:** Multiple languages via AI analysis\n\n---\n\n### 5. Auto Zoom\n\n**Frequency Settings:**\n| Level | Rate | Use Case |\n|-------|------|----------|\n| Low | ~1 zoom/min | Long-form content |\n| Medium (default) | 2-4 zooms/min | Standard content |\n| High | ~7 zooms/min | Short-form/fast-paced |\n\n**Zoom Settings:**\n| Setting | Description | Recommended |\n|---------|-------------|-------------|\n| Scale | Zoom level (100 = no zoom, 200 = 2x) | 120 |\n| Center Point | Where to zoom (center/custom) | Center or face |\n| Animation | Gradual vs sharp cut | User preference |\n| Duration | Total zoom duration | 0.8 sec |\n| Animation Duration | Keyframe animation length | 0.2-0.5 sec |\n| Easing | Timing curve (linear to smooth) | Middle |\n\n**Implementation:** Uses Adjustment Layers on new video track\n\n---\n\n### 6. Captions/Subtitles\n\n**Caption Types:**\n- **Styled Captions**: PNG images on video track (highly customizable animations)\n- **Text-Only**: Native Premiere Pro captions track\n\n**Features:**\n- 50+ languages (non-English ~70-80% accuracy)\n- Translation to different language\n- Auto emoji insertion\n- Custom style presets (save/reuse)\n- Guidance prompts (brand names, capitalization)\n- Voice Activity Detection (VAD) for silence handling\n\n**Export Formats:**\n- SRT\n- VTT\n\n**Processing:** ~5 sec/min audio (sentence + word level)\n\n---\n\n### 7. Chapter Detection\n\n**Output Options:**\n1. **Copy timestamps** - For YouTube description\n2. **Create markers** - Timeline navigation\n3. **Generate motion graphics** - Animated title cards\n\n**Settings:**\n- Scope: Full sequence or In/Out points\n- Language support (experimental for non-English)\n\n**Processing:** ~2 min per 10 min of sequence\n\n**Best Practice:** Run near end of workflow, after silence/repetition removal\n\n---\n\n### 8. Multi-Track / Podcast Editing\n\n**Core Function:** Automatically switches between video tracks based on audio loudness (like Zoom/Teams speaker detection)\n\n**Settings:**\n| Setting | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Speaker Switching Frequency | How sensitive to speaker changes |\n| Max Shot Duration | Time limit before forced cutaway |\n| Cutaway Shot Duration | Length of cutaway clips |\n| Cutting Operation | Disable (grey out) or Delete inactive segments |\n\n**How It Works:**\n1. Tag video tracks to corresponding audio tracks\n2. Label speakers by name\n3. FireCut analyzes loudness per track\n4. Switches to loudest speaker's camera\n5. Adds cutaways when max duration exceeded\n\n**Note:** Works on any language (follows loudness, not words)\n\n---\n\n### 9. Create Highlights (Short-Form Content)\n\n**Purpose:** Extract viral moments for Shorts/Reels/TikTok\n\n**Detection Settings:**\n| Setting | Description |\n|---------|-------------|\n| Number of highlights | Frequency per hour |\n| Highlight duration | 5-120 seconds range |\n| Enhanced accuracy | Slower but more precise timing |\n\n**Export Options:**\n- Vertical reframe to 9:16 (Auto Reframe or Custom with face detection)\n- Apply FireCut captions\n- Auto-suggest B-roll\n- AI-generated descriptions for social posts\n- Single sequence or one per highlight\n\n---\n\n### 10.
