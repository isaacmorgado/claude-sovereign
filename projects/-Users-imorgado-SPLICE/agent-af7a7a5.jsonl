If you are starting new development, start in UXP.(no content)CEP extensions continue to be supported; the plan is to support both CEP and UXP for a calendar year, after which Adobe will remove support for CEP extensibility.\n\n## CEP Status\n\nCEP 12 shipped with Photoshop 25.12, Premiere Pro 25.0, and After Effects 25.0. CEP 12 will be the last major update to CEP, although critical security issues will continue to be addressed.(no content)As Adobe works toward providing UXP-based extensibility, they've stopped additional work on the ExtendScript API.\n\n## UXP for Premiere Pro\n\nThe current plan is to officially release UXP extensibility, approaching 1:1 parity, this calendar year; perhaps even this summer.(no content)Placing trackItems into sequences has been in UXP for months. Adobe is working on .mogrt APIs now; the next SDK pre-release will contain that work.\n\n## Key Differences Between CEP and UXP\n\nCEP Extensions are comprised of a JavaScript/HTML/CSS frontend built on Node.js + Chromium (similar to NW.js) and an ExtendScript backend for interacting with the host application. UXP Plugins are also JavaScript/HTML/CSS based, however they are built on Adobe's own unique stack which makes them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack. Additionally, instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has 1 unified environment for your frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction back and forth.(no content)UXP has the unique ability of including a C++ Hybrid plugin aspect to run computationally heavy tasks or interact with a host app's C++ APIs directly from the plugin. Note that UXP Hybrid plugins are not yet implemented in Premiere Pro but will be in the future.\n\n## Recommendations\n\nUXP in Premiere Pro is still in beta, so there are lots of features/functions that either don't exist or don't fully work as needed. One additional thing to note is that UXP is only available in Premiere Pro Beta, so only beta users will be able to use your panel if you start shipping a UXP Panel for Premiere Pro today. If you want to release your plugin before UXP goes to stable, you might have difficulty as most users aren't running Beta.(no content)CEP and UXP each have their pros and cons, but the important thing to note is that UXP is replacing CEP, so tracking with UXP updates is very important for all Adobe 3rd party developers. Adobe has assured developers they should have \"several years\" to complete migration once UXP is out of beta and ready for general release.\n\n## Developer Resources\n\nSample UXP plugins are available at https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples/tree/main, documentation at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/, and the PPro UXP Dev Forum at https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/c/uxp-for-premiere-pro/105.(no content)For pre-release access, developers can reach out to ppro-uxp-extensibility@adobe.com for more information.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"1b0629cc-97d3-4ed0-a799-c91574070590","timestamp":"2025-12-19T01:44:09.591Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro CEP extension 2025 stable vs UXP beta alternative","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01KwmKp8QeUpZq7QHqv3xn4c","content":[{"title":"Premiere Pro UXP Beta — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro Extensions - To UXP or not to UXP - Adobe Product Community - 11326933","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-extensions-to-uxp-or-not-to-uxp/td-p/11326933"},{"title":"Updates for Creative Cloud Desktop Extensibility | by Padma Krishnamoorthy | Adobe Tech Blog | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/adobetech/updates-for-creative-cloud-desktop-extensibility-0dd5c663563e"},{"title":"Building Adobe Extensions — Blog | Hyper Brew","url":"https://hyperbrew.co/blog/building-adobe-extensions/"},{"title":"UXP vs CEP for Premiere Pro & After Effects – Which Should I Use? - UXP Developer Tool - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-vs-cep-for-premiere-pro-after-effects-which-should-i-use/10364"},{"title":"UXP vs CEP - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-vs-cep/9643"},{"title":"Solved: Full UXP support ETA - Adobe Product Community - 15352929","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/full-uxp-support-eta/td-p/15352929"},{"title":"Premiere Pro panels - Adobe-CEP/Samples","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/ReadMe.md"},{"title":"Extendscript hit the ground running | Pixel-Nexus","url":"https://pixel-nexus.com/extendscript_hit_the_ground_running.html"},{"title":"Solved: UXP vs CEP - Adobe Product Community - 14050320","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/indesign-discussions/uxp-vs-cep/td-p/14050320"}]},"Here's what I found regarding Premiere Pro CEP extensions vs UXP in 2025:\n\n## Current Status\n\nAs of Premiere Pro 25.6, CEP extensions to Premiere Pro have been superseded by UXP Extensibility.

When was UXP added to Premiere Pro stable release?\n\n**UXP is now available in Premiere Pro 25.6 (stable release)** - as of December 2025.\n\n- **Version**: Premiere Pro 25.6.0 (and current versions 25.6.2, 25.6.3)\n- **Release**: December 2025\n- **Status**: UXP has \"officially graduated from beta\" according to the [Adobe Developer Blog announcement](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n\n**Important**: Prior to 25.6, UXP was ONLY available in Premiere Pro Beta builds. If your plugin works in Beta but not stable, you may be running a stable version older than 25.6.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Differences between Beta and Stable for UXP support\n\n| Aspect | Pre-25.6 Stable | 25.6+ Stable | Beta |\n|--------|-----------------|--------------|------|\n| UXP Support | **No** | **Yes** | Yes |\n| CEP Support | Yes | Yes | Yes |\n| UXP Developer Tool | Won't detect | Works | Works |\n\n**Key Issue**: The [UXP Developer Tool fails to detect non-beta Premiere Pro versions](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-developer-tool-fails-to-detect-premiere-pro-2025-quot-no-applications-are-connected-quot/td-p/15514472) prior to 25.6, showing \"No applications are connected to the service.\"\n\n---\n\n### 3. Correct Manifest Configuration\n\n**Host ID**: Use `\"premierepro\"` (all lowercase) - NOT `\"PPRO\"` or `\"PremierePro\"`\n\nUsing incorrect casing like `\"PremierePro\"` causes: [\"Host Application specified is not available\" error](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-bugs/uxp-plugin-premiere-pro-host-application-specified-is-not-available-error-plugin-load-failed/idi-p/15423525)\n\n**Example manifest.json for maximum compatibility**:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"manifestVersion\": 5,\n  \"id\": \"com.yourcompany.yourplugin\",\n  \"name\": \"Your Plugin Name\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\",\n  \"main\": \"index.html\",\n  \"host\": {\n    \"app\": \"premierepro\",\n    \"minVersion\": \"25.6.0\"\n  },\n  \"entrypoints\": [\n    {\n      \"type\": \"panel\",\n      \"id\": \"mainPanel\",\n      \"label\": \"Your Plugin\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": \"all\"\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n**For development (multiple hosts)**:\n```json\n\"host\": [\n  { \"app\": \"premierepro\", \"minVersion\": \"25.6.0\" }\n]\n```\n\n**Note**: For production distribution (.ccx installers), the host property must be a single object, not an array.\n\n---\n\n### 4. CEP/ExtendScript for older stable versions\n\n**Yes, CEP is required for Premiere Pro versions before 25.6.**\n\n- [CEP 12 shipped with Premiere Pro 25.0](https://medium.com/adobetech/updates-for-creative-cloud-desktop-extensibility-0dd5c663563e) and is the last major CEP update\n- CEP extensions will be supported for **one calendar year** beyond UXP's stable release\n- ExtendScript-based integrations remain supported through September 2026\n\n**Recommendation from Adobe forums**:\n> \"If you plan on releasing soon, CEP is recommended. If you don't plan on releasing soon, then probably UXP.\"\n\n---\n\n### 5. Hybrid Plugin Strategy\n\nIf you need to support both old stable (pre-25.6) and new versions:\n\n**Option A: Two separate plugins**\n- CEP extension for Premiere Pro 25.0-25.5\n- UXP plugin for Premiere Pro 25.6+\n\n**Option B: Wait for 25.6 adoption**\n- UXP-only, but require users to update to 25.6+\n\n---\n\n### Your Specific Situation\n\nYour plugin loads in Beta but not stable release. This means:\n\n1. **Check your stable Premiere Pro version** - If it's below 25.6, UXP is not supported\n2. **Update to 25.6+** - The current stable release (25.6.3) now supports UXP\n3. **Verify manifest host ID** - Must be `\"premierepro\"` (lowercase)\n4. **Set minVersion to 25.6.0** - This is the first stable release with UXP\n\n---\n\n### Plugin Deployment Location\n\nFor loading UXP plugins without UDT:\n```\n~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/UXP/Plugins/External/\n```\n\nThe plugin folder name must include the three-digit version number from your manifest.json.\n\n---\n\n### Timeline Summary\n\n| Date | Event |\n|------|-------|\n| December 5, 2024 | Public UXP Beta for Premiere Pro |\n| December 2025 | UXP graduates from beta in Premiere Pro 25.6 |\n| ~December 2026 | Expected end of CEP support |\n| September 2026 | ExtendScript support ends |\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development (Adobe Blog)](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n- [UXP Developer Tool Fails to Detect Premiere Pro 2025](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-developer-tool-fails-to-detect-premiere-pro-2025-quot-no-applications-are-connected-quot/td-p/15514472)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP Beta - Hyper Brew](https://hyperbrew.co/blog/premiere-pro-uxp-beta/)\n- [Updates for Creative Cloud Desktop Extensibility (Adobe Tech Blog)](https://medium.com/adobetech/updates-for-creative-cloud-desktop-extensibility-0dd5c663563e)\n- [UXP Plugin \"Host Application specified is not available\" Error](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-bugs/uxp-plugin-premiere-pro-host-application-specified-is-not-available-error-plugin-load-failed/idi-p/15423525)\n- [The Premiere UXP API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Adobe UXP Premiere Pro Samples (GitHub)](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":341,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1098,"cache_read_input_tokens":26550,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1098,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWFCbexSjL95i3Grit7Vd","type":"assistant","uuid":"fd26cc49-9c3b-473f-9a3a-22dd73f6a529","timestamp":"2025-12-19T01:46:16.549Z"}
