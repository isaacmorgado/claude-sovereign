This is far more scalable and controllable than trying to get the main agent to manage dozens of subagent tasks.\n\n### 2. **Working with Large Files**\nClaude Code excels at updating extremely large files—for example, an 18,000-line React component. No other AI agent has successfully updated files this large except Claude Code.\n\n### 3. **Automated CI/CD and Pipeline Integration**\nYou can call `claude -p \"<your prompt>\" --json | your_command` to integrate Claude into processing pipelines. JSON output can help provide structure for easier automated processing. The `--verbose` flag helps with debugging.\n\n### 4. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**\nClaude Code can formalize a test-first cadence—generating failing tests, then making them pass without editing the tests. This enforces a clean separation between specification (tests) and implementation, and is particularly useful for legacy modules missing coverage.\n\n### 5. **Visual Design Implementation**\nYou can provide Claude with visual targets by giving it browser screenshots via Puppeteer MCP server, iOS simulator MCP server, or manual screenshots. Claude can implement the design in code, take screenshots of the result, and iterate until the result matches the mock.\n\n### 6. **Custom Slash Commands for Repeated Workflows**\nFor repeated workflows like debugging loops and log analysis, you can store prompt templates in Markdown files within the `.claude/commands` folder. These become available through the slash commands menu when you type `/`, and you can check these commands into git for team access.\n\n### 7. **Parallel Sub-Agent Development**\nSub-agents can run asynchronously in the background. Press Ctrl+B while a sub-agent is working to move it to the background and continue with other work. The sub-agent keeps running independently and can wake your main agent when it needs attention or finishes.\n\n### 8. **Building Custom Agents with the SDK**\nClaude Code isn't just an interactive CLI; it's also a powerful SDK for building entirely new agents—for both coding and non-coding tasks. Some developers use it as their default agent framework over tools like LangChain/CrewAI for hobby projects.\n\n### 9. **Headless Mode for Scripting**\nThe `-p` flag allows Claude Code to run in headless mode, meaning it will output the result directly to the terminal without entering the interactive interface, making it ideal for automation.\n\n### 10. **GitHub Integration**\nYou can create commands like `/project:fix-github-issue 1234` to have Claude automatically fix GitHub issues, including viewing issues, implementing changes, running tests, and creating PRs.\n\n### 11. **Rapid Prototyping with Checkpoints**\nClaude Code helps spin up scaffolds, scripts, and minimal features quickly while iterating safely using checkpoints. This accelerates early validation while capturing rationale, and checkpoints help isolate experiments without polluting mainline.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5df374bb-788a-48b7-bbc7-d9df7551760f","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:43:46.168Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Claude Code CLI best use cases when to use 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01SW1R9ypUiUy7mvtAsGdhhm","content":[{"title":"How I Use Every Claude Code Feature - by Shrivu Shankar","url":"https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-i-use-every-claude-code-feature"},{"title":"Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices"},{"title":"CLI reference - Claude Code Docs","url":"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference"},{"title":"How I use Claude Code (+ my best tips)","url":"https://www.builder.io/blog/claude-code"},{"title":"Cooking with Claude Code: The Complete Guide | Sid Bharath","url":"https://www.siddharthbharath.com/claude-code-the-complete-guide/"},{"title":"A Guide to Claude Code 2.0 and getting better at using coding agents | sankalp's blog","url":"https://sankalp.bearblog.dev/my-experience-with-claude-code-20-and-how-to-get-better-at-using-coding-agents/"},{"title":"Shipyard | Claude Code CLI Cheatsheet: config, commands, prompts, + best practices","url":"https://shipyard.build/blog/claude-code-cheat-sheet/"},{"title":"GitHub - hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code: A curated list of awesome commands, files, and workflows for Claude Code","url":"https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code"},{"title":"Claude Code: Best Practices and Pro Tips","url":"https://htdocs.dev/posts/claude-code-best-practices-and-pro-tips/"},{"title":"11 Essential Claude Code 2.0 Use Cases for AI-Assisted Development (2025)","url":"https://skywork.ai/blog/claude-code-2-0-use-cases-2025/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a summary of the best use cases for Claude Code CLI in 2025:\n\n## Best Use Cases for Claude Code CLI\n\n### 1. **Large-Scale Refactoring and Migrations**\nFor large-scale refactors, bug fixes, or migrations, users write simple bash scripts that call `claude -p \"in /pathA change all refs from foo to bar\"` in parallel.

This design philosophy creates a flexible, customizable, scriptable, and safe power tool.(no content)The official best practices post outlines general patterns that have proven effective, both for Anthropic's internal teams and for external engineers using Claude Code across various codebases, languages, and environments. Nothing in this list is set in stone nor universally applicable; consider these suggestions as starting points.\n\n### Key Workflow Recommendations\n\n1. **Plan Before Coding**: Steps #1-#2 (research and planning) are crucial—without them, Claude tends to jump straight to coding a solution. While sometimes that's what you want, asking Claude to research and plan first significantly improves performance for problems requiring deeper thinking upfront.\n\n2. **Iterate with Clear Targets**: Claude performs best when it has a clear target to iterate against—a visual mock, a test case, or another kind of output. By providing expected outputs like tests, Claude can make changes, evaluate results, and incrementally improve until it succeeds.\n\n3. **Use CLAUDE.md Files**: The better you document your workflows, tools, and expectations in Claude.md files, the better Claude Code performs. This made Claude Code excel at routine tasks like setting up new data pipelines when you have existing patterns.\n\n### Documentation & Tutorials\n\nThe official common workflows documentation includes clear instructions, example commands, and best practices to help you get the most from Claude Code.\n\nKey features covered include:\n- Git worktrees allow you to check out multiple branches from the same repository into separate directories. Each worktree has its own working directory with isolated files, while sharing the same Git history.\n\n- Extended thinking is disabled by default in Claude Code. You can enable it on-demand by using Tab to toggle Thinking on, or by using prompts like \"think\" or \"think hard\". You can also enable it permanently by setting the MAX_THINKING_TOKENS environment variable in your settings.\n\n### GitHub Repository\nClaude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster by executing routine tasks, explaining complex code, and handling git workflows—all through natural language commands. Use it in your terminal, IDE, or tag @claude on Github.\n\n### MCP Integration\nMCP is Anthropic's open standard for connecting AI assistants to external tools and data sources. Think of it as the universal connector that allows Claude Code to interact with any system in your development workflow - Jira, GitHub, whatever.\n\n### Security Best Practices\nFor sensitive data, Anthropic recommends using MCP servers rather than the BigQuery CLI to maintain better security control over what Claude Code can access, especially for handling sensitive data that requires logging or has potential privacy concerns.\n\nFor comprehensive documentation, you can visit:\n- Official documentation at [docs.anthropic.com](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/tutorials)\n- GitHub repository at [github.com/anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)\n- Best practices blog post at [anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"21ba8e98-d70e-408e-a6df-7a76f2b92bb6","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:43:47.234Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Anthropic Claude Code documentation best practices","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Bs3FKp3ao2scaBDNgxKh8y","content":[{"title":"Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices"},{"title":"How Anthropic teams use Claude Code","url":"https://www-cdn.anthropic.com/58284b19e702b49db9302d5b6f135ad8871e7658.pdf"},{"title":"Common workflows - Claude Docs","url":"https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/tutorials"},{"title":"GitHub - awattar/claude-code-best-practices: 💻 Best practices and examples for using Claude Code - Anthropic’s terminal-native AI - for writing, editing, and refactoring code with deep project awareness, prompt design, and safe automation.","url":"https://github.com/awattar/claude-code-best-practices"},{"title":"Claude Code overview - Claude Code Docs","url":"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/overview"},{"title":"ClaudeLog - Claude Code Docs, Guides, Tutorials & Best Practices","url":"https://claudelog.com/"},{"title":"Anthropic Academy: Claude API Development Guide","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/learn/build-with-claude"},{"title":"Documentation - Claude Docs","url":"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/home"},{"title":"Cooking with Claude Code: The Complete Guide | Sid Bharath","url":"https://www.siddharthbharath.com/claude-code-the-complete-guide/"},{"title":"GitHub - anthropics/claude-code: Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster by executing routine tasks, explaining complex code, and handling git workflows - all through natural language commands.","url":"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code"}]},"Here are the search results for \"Anthropic Claude Code documentation best practices\":\n\n## Official Anthropic Resources\n\n### Best Practices for Agentic Coding\nClaude Code is intentionally low-level and unopinionated, providing close to raw model access without forcing specific workflows.

It offers solid autocomplete, broad IDE support, and the lowest price.\n- GitHub Copilot's internal studies report 55% faster task completion with 30% code acceptance rates.\n- Copilot has seen wide adoption, with 82% of enterprises reportedly using it. That said, it does have some limitations, such as an 8,192-token cap that can hinder performance on very large codebases.\n- GitHub Copilot reached 15 million developers by early 2025.\n\n### **Cursor**\n- Cursor is an AI-powered code editor built on the familiar Visual Studio Code interface, but it takes things up a notch by embedding AI throughout the entire development environment.\n- What sets Cursor apart is its ability to analyze multiple files and understand your entire project at once. This makes it a strong choice for tasks like refactoring large codebases or coordinating changes across multiple files.\n- Cursor leads on setup speed, Docker/Render deployment, and code quality.\n- Cursor's pricing is straightforward: a free tier for trying things out, a $20/month Pro plan for serious individual use. Across multiple 2025-2026 roundups, Cursor averages about 4.9/5 in user ratings.\n- \"If you only want speedy autocomplete, Copilot or Codeium might be enough. If you want 'please rewrite these 9 files and show me diffs,' Cursor earns its keep.\"\n\n### **Claude Code**\n- Claude Code's terminal-native design appeals to developers preferring command-line workflows, enabling integration with existing shell scripts and automation pipelines. This approach trades visual IDE features for greater scriptability and support for remote development.\n- One of Claude's standout features is its ability to process up to 200,000 tokens, with outputs reaching up to 128,000 tokens. This makes it especially useful for handling massive codebases, conducting deep architectural reviews, and making strategic decisions on complex projects.\n- Claude Code is best for rapid prototypes and a productive terminal UX.\n- Claude Code excels in terminal-first, multi-step refactors and handles codebases over ~50k LOC successfully about 75% of the time, with Claude Pro at ≈ $20/month.\n- Claude Code also works directly in the terminal and integrates with tools like Figma, Jira, and Slack, providing flexibility for teams that need more than just code generation.\n\n## Use Case Recommendations\n\nIf you want an AI-native development experience with strong collaboration features, Cursor is worth exploring. If you're tackling a big refactoring project across lots of files, Claude Code or Cursor are your best allies.(no content)If your team is already deep in the GitHub ecosystem, Copilot Enterprise makes the most sense.(no content)Claude provides value when deciding how to extend the boilerplate—evaluating whether to add a new module, planning complex features, or documenting architectural decisions for your team.\n\n## Important Caveats\n\nA randomized controlled trial by METR found that AI tools increased task completion time by 19% among experienced developers. At the same time, GitClear's analysis of 211 million lines of code changes documented an 8-fold increase in code duplication during 2024.(no content)The Harness State of Software Delivery 2025 found that 67% of developers spend more time debugging AI-generated code than they do writing code manually.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nStart with GitHub Copilot for affordable MVP development. Use Cursor for advanced features in larger projects. Claude is a helpful secondary tool for tackling complex challenges or aiding non-technical founders.(no content)The pattern developers report: they don't stick to one tool.

With a simple @claude mention in any PR or issue, Claude can analyze your code, create pull requests, implement features, and fix bugs.\n\n### Key Features\n\nThe action is a general-purpose Claude Code action for GitHub PRs and issues that can answer questions and implement code changes. It intelligently detects when to activate based on your workflow context—whether responding to @claude mentions, issue assignments, or executing automation tasks with explicit prompts. It supports multiple authentication methods including Anthropic direct API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Vertex AI, and Microsoft Foundry.(no content)Features include intelligent mode detection (automatically selects the appropriate execution mode), interactive code assistant, code review (analyzes PR changes and suggests improvements), code implementation (can implement simple fixes, refactoring, and even new features), and PR/Issue integration.\n\n### Setup\n\nThe easiest way to set up this action is through Claude Code in the terminal. Just open claude and run `/install-github-app`. This command will guide you through setting up the GitHub app and required secrets.\n\n### Use Cases\n\nYou can configure interactive reviews (trigger only when a user comments @claude on a PR), automated security audits using specialized prompts or slash commands like /security-review, release note generation (runs when a tag is pushed to summarize all PRs), and code refactoring (ask Claude to refactor specific files for better readability or performance).\n\n### Headless Mode for CI/CD\n\nClaude Code isn't limited to interactive use. With headless mode, you can integrate it into your CI/CD pipelines.(no content)You can leverage headless mode using Claude Code with the `-p` flag (`claude -p`) for automation and scripting. This is ideal for integrating Claude into CI/CD pipelines or for large-scale migrations.\n\n### Best Practices\n\nCreate a CLAUDE.md file in your repository root. This special file is automatically pulled into Claude's context, making it ideal for documenting code style guidelines, testing instructions, core files, utility functions, and repository etiquette. Claude respects this file even when running in CI/CD pipelines.(no content)Security considerations include always using GitHub Secrets for API keys (e.g., `${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}`) instead of hardcoding them, limiting action permissions to only what is necessary, and always reviewing Claude's suggestions before merging.\n\n### Version Info\n\nClaude Code, built on Anthropic's Claude Sonnet 4.5 model, launched its GitHub Actions integration on September 29, 2025, as part of the Claude Code 2.0 release.(no content)Claude Opus 4.5 is now available.

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that work with isolated code snippets, Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project architecture, understanding relationships between files, modules, and components across potentially millions of lines of code. It can navigate complex dependency graphs, trace code paths across multiple files, and understand how changes in one part of the system might affect other components.\n\n### Benchmark Performance\n\nOn the HumanEval benchmark, Claude Code edges ahead with 92% accuracy compared to Codex's 90.2%. The gap widens significantly on SWE-bench, where Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieves 70.3% accuracy for multi-file bug fixing tasks.(no content)Claude Sonnet 4 significantly improves on Sonnet 3.7's industry-leading capabilities, excelling in coding with a state-of-the-art 72.7% on SWE-bench.\n\n### Enterprise Use Cases\n\nCursor calls it state-of-the-art for coding and a leap forward in complex codebase understanding. Replit reports improved precision and dramatic advancements for complex changes across multiple files.(no content)Rakuten validated its capabilities with a demanding open-source refactor running independently for 7 hours with sustained performance.(no content)Real-world examples include developers successfully using Claude Code on massive React applications with 18,000+ line components, complex microservices architectures, and enterprise Java applications with extensive dependency trees.\n\n### Best Practices for Large Codebases\n\nBest practices include planning small and iterating fast with 5–20 file batches, draft PRs, and clear rollback procedures. Additionally, automating validation with lints and tests should gate every change, with CI runs being non-destructive first.(no content)Using git worktrees enables you to run multiple Claude sessions simultaneously on different parts of your project, each focused on its own independent task.

Unlike traditional AI coding assistants that work with isolated code snippets, Claude Code maintains awareness of your entire project architecture, understanding relationships between files, modules, and components across potentially millions of lines of code. It can navigate complex dependency graphs, trace code paths across multiple files, and understand how changes in one part of the system might affect other components.\n\n### Benchmark Performance\n\nOn the HumanEval benchmark, Claude Code edges ahead with 92% accuracy compared to Codex's 90.2%. The gap widens significantly on SWE-bench, where Claude 3.7 Sonnet achieves 70.3% accuracy for multi-file bug fixing tasks.(no content)Claude Sonnet 4 significantly improves on Sonnet 3.7's industry-leading capabilities, excelling in coding with a state-of-the-art 72.7% on SWE-bench.\n\n### Enterprise Use Cases\n\nCursor calls it state-of-the-art for coding and a leap forward in complex codebase understanding. Replit reports improved precision and dramatic advancements for complex changes across multiple files.(no content)Rakuten validated its capabilities with a demanding open-source refactor running independently for 7 hours with sustained performance.(no content)Real-world examples include developers successfully using Claude Code on massive React applications with 18,000+ line components, complex microservices architectures, and enterprise Java applications with extensive dependency trees.\n\n### Best Practices for Large Codebases\n\nBest practices include planning small and iterating fast with 5–20 file batches, draft PRs, and clear rollback procedures. Additionally, automating validation with lints and tests should gate every change, with CI runs being non-destructive first.(no content)Using git worktrees enables you to run multiple Claude sessions simultaneously on different parts of your project, each focused on its own independent task. For instance, you might have one Claude refactoring your authentication system while another builds a completely unrelated data visualization component.\n\n### Context Window Advantage\n\nIn late 2025, Claude's models like Claude 3.5 and 4 could accept contexts in the 100K+ token range, far exceeding typical code AI tools.

The Pro plan promises 5x the usage allowed for the Free plan; the Max plan promises either 5x or 20x the usage of the Pro plan.\n\n### Token Allocations\nClaude Code operates on a 5-hour rolling window that begins with your first message in a session. Pro users get approximately 44,000 tokens per window, Max5 users get around 88,000, and Max20 users receive roughly 220,000 tokens. These limits reset every 5 hours.(no content)Max 5x ($100/month): Average users can send approximately 225 messages with Claude every five hours, OR send approximately 50-200 prompts with Claude Code every five hours. Most Max 5x users can expect 140-280 hours of Sonnet 4 and 15-35 hours of Opus 4 within their weekly usage limits. This will vary based on factors such as codebase size and user settings like auto-accept mode. Heavy Opus users with large codebases or those running multiple Claude Code instances in parallel will hit their limits sooner.\n\n### Weekly Limits (August 2025 Update)\nStarting in August 2025, Anthropic introduced weekly limits on top of the 5-hour windows. This was a response to a small number of users who were consuming resources at unsustainable rates.(no content)Weekly limit kicker (28 Aug 2025): Pro ≈ 40-80 Claude Code hours; Max tiers scale proportionally. The 5-hour windows stay—weekly just adds a ceiling.\n\n### Automatic Model Switching\nTo prevent hitting limits too fast, Max plans include automatic model switching: Max 5x switches from Opus 4 → Sonnet 4 at 20% usage. Max 20x switches from Opus 4 → Sonnet 4 at 50% usage. Manual control is possible with the /model command, but remember Opus consumes capacity much faster.\n\n## Token Management Strategies\n\n### Context Management Commands\nThe /compact command strategically reduces context size, /clear provides fresh session starts, and /context (v1.0.86+) helps debug context issues and optimize usage.(no content)The tool provides several mechanisms for managing token usage including selective file reading where you can specify which files Claude Code should analyze, context compaction through the /clear and /compact commands that reset or summarize conversation history, and strategic prompt design that focuses on specific tasks rather than broad analysis.\n\n### Session Timing Strategy\nBecause Claude operates on rolling usage windows, start major development tasks right after a reset to ensure maximum quota availability. Some teams even schedule coding sessions to align with reset cycles.(no content)All plans reset every 5 hours with exact countdown timing displayed in the Claude Code interface. Strategic developers plan intensive work sessions around these reset cycles to maximize available allocation.\n\n### Model Selection Strategy\nUse Sonnet for most daily coding and refactoring work, Opus for deep architectural reasoning or debugging across large codebases, and Haiku for short, targeted tasks such as writing tests or formatting.(no content)Optimal consumption follows the 80/20 principle - use Sonnet for most development work while reserving Opus for advanced reasoning tasks.\n\n### Prompt Optimization\nOptimize prompt structure: Combine multiple related instructions into a single, well-scoped prompt instead of spreading them across multiple exchanges. Reference already uploaded files instead of re-uploading them, and cache common system instructions.\n\n### Project Organization\nStart new conversations for each topic. Batch related questions together. Be mindful of attachment sizes as they impact usage limits. Use projects to store documents in project knowledge instead of repeatedly uploading them. Break large documents into smaller sections before uploading.(no content)For large projects, users can create concise CLAUDE.md files that provide essential project context without consuming excessive tokens, and use custom slash commands that encapsulate frequently used workflows into efficient, reusable prompts.\n\n### Additional Tips\nDisable unused tools or plugins: Turn off integrations not needed in a session to reduce incidental token and compute usage. Use auto-compact strategically: Summarization tools can help, but excessive use may introduce hidden token costs if old logs and references persist.(no content)Avoid using the final 20% of your context window for complex tasks, as performance degrades significantly when approaching limits.\n\n### Monitoring Usage\nMonitor your remaining allocation using the /status command.(no content)Max subscribers can purchase additional usage, beyond what the rate limit provides, at standard API rates.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0361aa54-6a01-4d86-8a97-8f0beac46fc2","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:44:45.048Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Claude Code Max plan rate limits token management strategies 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01LCKyYHqeXomjbutAtsNai4","content":[{"title":"Claude devs complain about surprise usage limits • The Register","url":"https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/claude_devs_usage_limits/"},{"title":"Claude Code Limits | ClaudeLog","url":"https://claudelog.com/claude-code-limits/"},{"title":"Claude Code Limits Explained (2025 Edition)","url":"https://www.truefoundry.com/blog/claude-code-limits-explained"},{"title":"Claude Code: Rate limits, pricing, and alternatives | Blog — Northflank","url":"https://northflank.com/blog/claude-rate-limits-claude-code-pricing-cost"},{"title":"Everything We Know About Claude Code Limits","url":"https://portkey.ai/blog/claude-code-limits/"},{"title":"Claude Code Usage Limits and Subscription Plans Explained (Aug 2025) - Geeky Gadgets","url":"https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/claude-code-usage-limits-pricing-plans-guide-sept-2025/"},{"title":"Claude Code Token Limits: A Guide for Engineering Leaders | Faros AI","url":"https://www.faros.ai/blog/claude-code-token-limits"},{"title":"About Claude's Max Plan Usage | Claude Help Center","url":"https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11014257-about-claude-s-max-plan-usage"},{"title":"Using Claude Code with your Pro or Max plan | Claude Help Center","url":"https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11145838-using-claude-code-with-your-pro-or-max-plan"},{"title":"What are the token limits for Claude Code?","url":"https://milvus.io/ai-quick-reference/what-are-the-token-limits-for-claude-code"}]},"Based on the search results, here's comprehensive information about Claude Code Max plan rate limits and token management strategies:\n\n## Claude Code Max Plan Rate Limits\n\n### Plan Structure\nAnthropic offers three individual subscription plans: Free, Pro ($20/month), and Max ($100 or $200 per month), each with its own usage limits.

There's no special \"auto-commit\" mode or configuration - you simply ask Claude to handle git operations and it does.(no content)The key insight is that Claude sees your git history and understands context, so its commit messages actually describe what changed and why.\n\n### Automated Workflows\n\nIf you are using Claude Code, you can use the \"hooks\" functionality to manage the output of even multiple simultaneous instances, while isolating all the generated code into virtual or stacked branches automatically.(no content)/commit-fast automates the git commit process by selecting the first suggested message, generating structured commits with consistent formatting while skipping manual confirmation.(no content)/create-pr streamlines pull request creation by handling the entire workflow: creating a new branch, committing changes, formatting modified files, and submitting the PR."],"durationSeconds":24.270295749999583}}

This fundamentally shapes how developers interact with each tool. Claude Code runs entirely in the terminal, giving it broad flexibility across environments, from local development to remote servers and CI pipelines.\n\n## When to Use Terminal-Based Workflow\n\nAdopting a terminal-based workflow reduces system resource consumption, improves responsiveness, and creates a focused development environment.(no content)Claude Code creator Churnney emphasizes the benefits of adopting a terminal-based setup as a lightweight and efficient alternative to traditional integrated development environments (IDEs) such as VS Code.(no content)Given you can use Claude Code in any interface - IDE, Terminal, or Web, it makes sense for cost-conscious developers. IDEs such as Cursor and Windsurf usage gets expensive.\n\n## When to Use IDE Integration\n\nWhile the terminal is powerful, many developers spend the majority of their time in an integrated development environment (IDE). Claude recognizes this reality and supports direct integration with Visual Studio Code and JetBrains IDEs. Running Claude Code inside the IDE terminal automatically links the environment, enabling inline diffs and proposed edits inside source files.

It makes opening Claude Code dead simple, and you can run multiple instances in parallel in different panes in your IDE as long as they're working on different parts of your codebase.(no content)Many developers still use Cursor for quick Command+K completions and tab completions, but only touch the agent sidebar when Claude is down.(no content)The VS Code extension (beta) adds inline diffs and a sidebar for mixed terminal/IDE workflows. Combined, these help you keep diffs tight, iterate faster, and maintain a coherent discussion history.\n\n## Best Practices for Developer Workflow\n\nThe recommended workflow is: Plan → small diff → tests → review. Never skip steps under pressure. Treat AI output as untrusted until verified; gate merges with tests and human review.(no content)Claude Code runs in your terminal and works alongside your preferred IDE and development tools without requiring you to change your workflow.

The author's monorepo baseline costs ~20k tokens (10% of 200k window), leaving 180k for actual work.\n\nThree workflow strategies:\n- `/clear` + `/catchup` (simple restarts)\n- \"Document & Clear\" method (complex tasks)\n- Avoid `/compact`—the automatic compaction is \"opaque, error-prone, and not well-optimized\"\n\n### Hooks (Critical for Enterprise)\nThe author employs \"block-at-submit\" hooks checking for test passage before allowing commits, forcing Claude into test-and-fix loops. Intentionally avoids blocking at write time—it \"confuses or even frustrates\" agents mid-plan.\n\n## Features the Author Avoids or Dislikes\n\n**Custom Subagents**: Creates problematic gatekeeping—hiding testing context from the main agent. Prefers letting the agent use built-in `Task()` features to self-manage delegation.\n\n**MCPs for Stateless Tools**: Migrated Jira, AWS, GitHub from MCP to simple CLIs; only retains Playwright MCP.\n\n**Long Slash Command Lists**: Viewing extensive custom commands as an anti-pattern that forces engineers to learn undocumented magic instead of building intuitive `CLAUDE.md` documentation.\n\n## Real-World Wins\n\n- Using Claude Code GitHub Actions for \"PR-from-anywhere\" tooling triggered via Slack/Jira\n- Parallel bash scripting: `claude -p \"in /pathA change all refs from foo to bar\"` executed concurrently\n- Meta-analysis of GHA logs creates \"data-driven flywheel: Bugs → Improved CLAUDE.md / CLIs → Better Agent\"\n\n## When Claude Code Struggles\n\nThe author notes developers often over-index on superficial preferences (output style, system prompt \"vibe\") rather than substance. Success requires proper context engineering—not relying on agent capabilities alone.","durationMs":12364,"url":"https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-i-use-every-claude-code-feature"}}

This research synthesizes information from official Anthropic documentation, developer blogs, Reddit/HackerNews discussions, and real-world benchmarks to provide actionable guidance on when and how to use Claude Code effectively.\n\n---\n\n## 1. What Tasks Claude Code Excels At\n\n### Large-Scale Refactoring and Migrations\nClaude Code's standout capability is handling massive refactoring operations. According to [Anthropic's best practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices), developers write simple bash scripts that call `claude -p \"in /pathA change all refs from foo to bar\"` in parallel for large-scale refactors, bug fixes, or migrations.\n\n**Real-world example**: Claude Code successfully updated an 18,000-line React component - a task that no other AI agent has completed successfully.\n\n### Terminal-First and CLI Integration\nClaude Code's design appeals to developers who prefer command-line workflows. Key advantages include:\n- Integration with existing shell scripts and automation pipelines\n- Greater scriptability than IDE-based tools\n- Support for remote development and SSH sessions\n- Seamless piping: `cat foo.txt | claude` or `git diff | claude`\n\n### Git Workflow Automation\nClaude Code provides deep Git integration including:\n- Generating meaningful commit messages based on actual changes\n- Creating and managing pull requests from the terminal\n- Resolving merge conflicts with context awareness\n- History searches and patch grafting\n- Using [git worktrees](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows) for parallel development sessions\n\n### CI/CD and Automation\nThe `-p` (headless) flag enables powerful automation scenarios:\n- `claude -p \"<prompt>\" --json | your_command` for pipeline integration\n- GitHub Actions integration via [@claude mentions](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action) in PRs and issues\n- Automated code reviews triggered by GitHub events\n- Build failure diagnosis and auto-fixes\n\n### Codebase Q&A and Understanding\nClaude Code excels at answering questions about existing codebases:\n- \"How does logging work in this project?\"\n- \"Why was this API designed this way?\"\n- \"What files would need to change for feature X?\"\n\n---\n\n## 2. What Claude Code Struggles With\n\n### Usage Limits and Unpredictable Costs\nThe most common complaint according to [The Register](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/claude_devs_usage_limits/) and [community discussions](https://www.datastudios.org/post/anthropic-imposes-sudden-limits-on-claude-code-the-developer-community-rebels-against-the-platform):\n- Pro users report hitting limits within 10-15 minutes\n- Weekly limits added in August 2025 compound 5-hour rolling windows\n- Usage shared across all Claude applications (web, mobile, Claude Code)\n- Opaque token consumption makes planning difficult\n\n### Security Vulnerability Detection\nAccording to [Semgrep's research](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/finding-vulnerabilities-in-modern-web-apps-using-claude-code-and-openai-codex/):\n- Claude Code found vulnerabilities with only a 14% true positive rate\n- 86% false positive rate on security analysis\n- Struggles with inter-procedural taint flow and implicit flows\n- Non-deterministic results: identical prompts yield vastly different findings\n\n### Complex Multi-Repo Systems\n[Developer reports](https://thrawn01.org/posts/why-claude-code-keeps-writing-terrible-code---and-how-to-fix-it) indicate:\n- AI can miss the \"why\" behind code, especially in large multi-repo systems\n- May remove code that seems unused but is critical for future updates\n- A 2025 survey found 76% of developers rewrite at least half of AI-generated code\n\n### Quick In-Editor Autocomplete\nClaude Code is not optimized for:\n- Tab completions during active typing\n- Ultra-low-latency suggestions\n- \"Painting the walls\" (quick, small edits) - better suited for Cursor\n\n---\n\n## 3. CLI Workflow vs IDE Integration: When Each Wins\n\n### Choose CLI-Based Claude Code When:\n\n| Scenario | Why CLI Wins |\n|----------|--------------|\n| Working on remote servers via SSH | Terminal-native, no GUI needed |\n| CI/CD automation and scripting | Headless mode with `-p` flag |\n| Large-scale parallel refactoring | Scriptable with bash loops |\n| Cost-conscious development | IDEs like Cursor add subscription costs |\n| Monorepos with complex tooling | Direct filesystem access with `--add-dir` |\n| Security-sensitive environments | No external IDE dependencies |\n| Multi-file feature implementation | \"Building the house\" tasks |\n\n### Choose IDE Integration (Cursor/Copilot) When:\n\n| Scenario | Why IDE Wins |\n|----------|--------------|\n| Real-time autocomplete needed | Ultra-low latency tab completions |\n| Visual diff review preferred | Side-by-side comparison in editor |\n| Quick single-file edits | \"Painting the walls\" tasks |\n| Learning a new codebase | Visual context helps understanding |\n| Documentation lookup during coding | Cursor can search web for docs |\n\n### Hybrid Approach (Recommended)\nMany developers report [using both](https://www.qodo.ai/blog/claude-code-vs-cursor/): Cursor for daily coding flow ($20/month) + Claude Code for complex tasks (~$100/month) = 3x productivity at $120/month total.\n\n---\n\n## 4. Real User Experiences and Complaints\n\n### Positive Experiences\nFrom [HackerNews analysis](https://www.birkey.co/2025-08-02-hacker-news-ai-coding-experience-analysis.html):\n- Claude 3.7 Sonnet received 2,127 points with overwhelmingly positive reception\n- Described as \"clear winner for code quality, reasoning, and complex tasks\"\n- Works exceptionally well for specific developer contexts\n\n### Common Complaints\n\n**Usage Limits** ([developer blog](https://sankalp.bearblog.dev/my-claude-code-experience-after-2-weeks-of-usage/)):\n- \"Many Max users found their sessions blocked after just a few hundred requests\"\n- \"Frustration has poured into Reddit, GitHub, and Hacker News\"\n\n**Quality Degradation** ([Medium article](https://medium.com/utopian/what-happened-to-claude-240eadc392d3)):\n- Users report going from \"collaborating with a Senior Developer\" to \"supervising a Junior Developer\"\n- Some theorize model quantization to reduce costs\n\n**API Outages**:\n- Anthropic had significant outages driving users to alternatives like Codex or GPT-5.1 on Cursor\n\n---\n\n## 5. Best Practices from Anthropic's Documentation\n\n### The Recommended Workflow\nFrom [Anthropic's official guide](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):\n\n1. **Explore**: Have Claude read relevant files without coding initially\n2. **Plan**: Request a detailed plan using \"think\" or \"think hard\" for extended reasoning\n3. **Code**: Implement incrementally toward the plan\n4. **Commit**: Create commits with clear messages\n\n### CLAUDE.md Configuration\nCritical for success - create files documenting:\n- Common bash commands\n- Core files and utility functions\n- Code style guidelines\n- Testing instructions\n- Repository etiquette\n\n**Anti-patterns to avoid** (from [developer experience](https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-i-use-every-claude-code-feature)):\n- Don't embed entire documentation files\n- Avoid negative-only constraints (\"never use X\")\n- Don't create extensive custom command lists\n\n### Context Management Commands\n- `/compact`: Strategically reduces context size\n- `/clear`: Fresh session starts\n- `/context`: Debug context issues (v1.0.86+)\n- `/status`: Monitor remaining allocation\n\n---\n\n## 6. CI/CD and Automation Use Cases\n\n### GitHub Actions Integration\nFrom [official documentation](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/github-actions):\n\n```yaml\n# Trigger Claude on @claude mentions in PRs\n- uses: anthropics/claude-code-action@v1\n  with:\n    anthropic_api_key: ${{ secrets.ANTHROPIC_API_KEY }}\n```\n\n### Specific Automation Scenarios\n1. **Automated PR Reviews**: Analyze PR changes and suggest improvements\n2. **Issue Triage**: Automatically label and respond to GitHub issues\n3. **Build Failure Resolution**: Read failure logs, identify problems, push fixes\n4. **Release Note Generation**: Summarize PRs when tags are pushed\n5. **Security Audits**: Run security review on code changes\n\n### Headless Mode Best Practices\n```bash\n# Basic headless execution\nclaude -p \"refactor auth module\" --allowedTools Edit\n\n# With JSON output for parsing\nclaude -p \"analyze test coverage\" --output-format stream-json\n\n# Parallel execution for migrations\nfor file in *.py; do\n  claude -p \"migrate $file to new API\" &\ndone\nwait\n```\n\n---\n\n## 7. Git Workflow Integration Specifics\n\n### Branch Management with Worktrees\nFrom [Claude Code docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows):\n```bash\ngit worktree add ../project-feature-a feature-a\ncd ../project-feature-a && claude\n```\nThis enables running multiple Claude sessions simultaneously on different branches.\n\n### Automated Commit Workflow\nClaude reads your git history and generates contextual commit messages. Custom commands enhance this:\n- `/commit-fast`: Automates git commit with first suggested message\n- `/create-pr`: Full workflow: branch, commit, format, submit PR\n\n### Git Hooks Integration\nFrom [GitButler integration](https://docs.gitbutler.com/features/ai-integration/claude-code-hooks):\n- Block-at-submit hooks checking for test passage before commits\n- Forces Claude into test-and-fix loops until tests pass\n\n---\n\n## 8. Large Codebase Handling Capabilities\n\n### Context Window Advantage\nClaude's 200K token context window (with 128K output) enables:\n- Processing massive codebases in single passes\n- Understanding relationships across many files\n- Deep architectural reviews\n\n### Performance Benchmarks\nFrom [benchmark testing](https://render.com/blog/ai-coding-agents-benchmark):\n- Handles codebases over 50k LOC successfully ~75% of the time\n- HumanEval: 92% accuracy\n- SWE-bench multi-file bug fixing: 70.3% (Sonnet 4)\n\n### Best Practices for Large Projects\nFrom [enterprise guidance](https://skywork.ai/blog/claude-code-plugin-best-practices-large-codebases-2025/):\n- Plan small and iterate fast with 5-20 file batches\n- Use draft PRs with clear rollback procedures\n- Gate every change with lints and tests\n- Run CI non-destructively first\n\n---\n\n## 9. Rate Limit Management Strategies for Max Plan Users\n\n### Understanding the Limits\nFrom [official documentation](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11014257-about-claude-s-max-plan-usage):\n\n| Plan | 5-Hour Window | Weekly Ceiling |\n|------|---------------|----------------|\n| Pro ($20) | ~44K tokens | 40-80 Claude Code hours |\n| Max 5x ($100) | ~88K tokens | 140-280 hours Sonnet 4 |\n| Max 20x ($200) | ~220K tokens | Proportionally higher |\n\n### Token Management Strategies\n\n**1. Model Selection Strategy**\nFrom [usage guides](https://claudelog.com/claude-code-limits/):\n- Use Sonnet for 80% of daily work\n- Reserve Opus for deep architectural reasoning\n- Max 5x auto-switches Opus to Sonnet at 20% usage\n\n**2. Session Timing**\n- Start major tasks right after 5-hour reset\n- Schedule intensive work around reset cycles\n- Monitor with `/status` command\n\n**3. Context Optimization**\n- Use `/clear` between task transitions\n- Create concise CLAUDE.md files (not massive docs)\n- Batch related questions together\n- Disable unused tools/plugins\n\n**4. Prompt Efficiency**\n- Combine related instructions into single prompts\n- Reference already-uploaded files instead of re-uploading\n- Avoid the final 20% of context window for complex tasks\n\n---\n\n## 10. When the 77% SWE-bench Accuracy Actually Matters\n\n### Understanding the Benchmark\nFrom [Anthropic's research](https://www.anthropic.com/research/swe-bench-sonnet):\n- Claude Sonnet 4.5 achieved 77.2% on SWE-bench Verified\n- Tested on 500 real GitHub issues requiring multi-file fixes\n- Uses simple scaffold with bash and file editing tools\n\n### When High Accuracy Matters\n\n**Complex Bug Fixes**:\nThe 77% score reflects ability to:\n- Navigate complex dependency graphs\n- Trace code paths across multiple files\n- Understand how changes in one component affect others\n\n**Multi-File Changes**:\nUnlike simpler benchmarks, SWE-bench requires coordinated changes across files - exactly what Claude Code does well.\n\n### When It Doesn't Matter\n\n**SWE-Bench Pro Reality Check**:\nFrom [Scale AI's benchmark](https://scale.com/leaderboard/swe_bench_pro_public):\n- Best models score only ~23% on SWE-Bench Pro (harder version)\n- Real-world performance often differs from benchmarks\n\n**Simple Tasks**:\nFor basic autocomplete, single-file edits, or quick fixes, the high accuracy advantage is irrelevant - simpler tools suffice.\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Decision Matrix\n\n| Task Type | Best Tool | Reasoning |\n|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n| Large-scale refactoring | **Claude Code** | Parallel headless mode, multi-file handling |\n| CI/CD automation | **Claude Code** | `-p` flag, GitHub Actions integration |\n| Git workflow automation | **Claude Code** | Deep Git understanding, worktree support |\n| Codebase Q&A | **Claude Code** | 200K context window, architectural awareness |\n| Quick autocomplete | **Cursor/Copilot** | Low-latency, tab completion |\n| Visual diff review | **Cursor** | IDE-native experience |\n| Budget-conscious usage | **Cline** | BYOK with own API keys |\n| Security-sensitive code | **Human review required** | 14% true positive rate on vulnerabilities |\n| Remote/SSH development | **Claude Code** | Terminal-native |\n| Learning new codebase | **Cursor** | Visual context helps |\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Anthropic: Claude Code Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)\n- [How I Use Every Claude Code Feature - Shrivu Shankar](https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-i-use-every-claude-code-feature)\n- [Claude Code CLI Reference](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/cli-reference)\n- [Claude Code GitHub Actions](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/github-actions)\n- [The Register: Claude Code Usage Limits](https://www.theregister.com/2026/01/05/claude_devs_usage_limits/)\n- [Claude Code vs Cursor Comparison - Qodo](https://www.qodo.ai/blog/claude-code-vs-cursor/)\n- [Render AI Coding Agents Benchmark](https://render.com/blog/ai-coding-agents-benchmark)\n- [Claude Code Limits Explained - TrueFoundry](https://www.truefoundry.com/blog/claude-code-limits-explained)\n- [Anthropic: About Max Plan Usage](https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11014257-about-claude-s-max-plan-usage)\n- [Semgrep: Finding Vulnerabilities with Claude Code](https://semgrep.dev/blog/2025/finding-vulnerabilities-in-modern-web-apps-using-claude-code-and-openai-codex/)\n- [Anthropic: Claude 4 Announcement](https://www.anthropic.com/news/claude-4)\n- [SWE-bench Performance Data](https://www.vals.ai/benchmarks/swebench)\n- [GitHub: anthropics/claude-code-action](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-action)\n- [Common Workflows - Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/common-workflows)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2482,"cache_read_input_tokens":42548,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2482,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWzMNjF1WfwhKRrrYphrG","type":"assistant","uuid":"96cdd770-317d-4c89-8c29-903f198d72d7","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:47:57.134Z"}
