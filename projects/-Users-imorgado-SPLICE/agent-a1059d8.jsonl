Since you're paying for API calls to whatever model you're using, big refactoring tasks can get pricey.\n\n### Claude Code\n- Claude Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that lives in your terminal, helping developers write and debug code faster through natural language.\n- If Roo is your collaborative pair programmer, Claude Code is your surgical specialist. It's incredibly good at just doing the thing you ask it to do, with a high degree of accuracy.\n- Claude Code is known for making surgical, necessary corrections without adding a bunch of fluff, which saves time and reduces the risk of introducing new bugs.\n- Because it's a CLI tool, it's scriptable. This is a huge deal for enterprise workflows - you can integrate Claude Code into GitHub Actions to automatically refactor code on a pull request or write documentation for new functions.\n- Claude Code feels really powerful, but it does need some set-up—especially on Windows where you'll have to use WSL. Once you get past the learning curve, it shines.\n\n## Developer Opinions from Forums\n\nOne developer noted: \"I've dabbled with both—API with Roo and ClaudeCode. Claude Code has an edge in performance, especially since there's no rate limiting. But Roo offers more control and a better coding experience overall. Just be aware of the costs associated with API use; it can add up fast. If you want something that tackles everything in one go, Claude Code is the route to take, but if you prefer customization, Roo might be your best bet.\"(no content)On Hacker News, one user compared the two directly: \"I asked Claude Code to [create documentation] with the same prompt. It created several markdown files with half a dozen mermaid diagrams describing the tech stack, the architecture, the data model and so much more.\"(no content)However, some developers prefer Roo: \"In my experience, Roo and Cline are actually outpacing CC, which surprised me! I tried Claude Max but found myself going back to Cline for better performance and less hassle. Sometimes, I feel like I have to wrestle with CC just to get it to listen to me.\"\n\n## Pricing Comparison\n\n- Claude Code's Free plan lets you try Claude on web, mobile, and desktop with basic chat and code generation features. Pro costs $17 per month when billed annually, or $20 monthly.\n- Claude Max costs $100/month for heavy usage without rate limits.\n- Roo Code's Cloud Free plan costs nothing and includes token usage tracking. For advanced users, Pro costs $20 per month plus $5 per hour for cloud tasks.\n\n## Bottom Line\n\nThe industry is moving toward increasingly automated development flows with less human involvement. For now, the sweet spot lies in tools that integrate seamlessly with IDEs while still offering strong automation — with Claude Code being considered the best option by some developers.(no content)Both Roo and Claude are considered two of the best AI coding tools available, and the fact that Roo Code, an open-source project, can stand toe-to-toe with a powerhouse like Anthropic is seen as a huge win for the developer community.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0c37c884-f0e9-4137-963a-b1047e8c4c52","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:43:54.315Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Roo Code vs Claude Code developer experience Reddit 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01DYTUztfZ7914xnAM9RPC5Z","content":[{"title":"Roo vs. Claude Code: Best AI for Large, Complex Codebases","url":"https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases"},{"title":"The Only AI Coding Stack That Isn’t Complete Garbage: VSCode, Roocode, Augment, and Why Claude is the Only AI for “Vibe Coding” as of May, 2025 | by Aeon Flex, Elriel Assoc. 2133 [NEON MAXIMA] | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@neonmaxima/the-only-ai-coding-stack-that-isnt-complete-garbage-vscode-rocode-augment-and-why-claude-is-eb4352bd0e3d"},{"title":"Claude Code vs Roo Code: Features, Pricing and User Reviews 2025","url":"https://toolquestor.com/vs/claude-code-vs-roo-code"},{"title":"Compare Claude Code vs. Roo Code in 2026","url":"https://slashdot.org/software/comparison/Claude-Code-vs-Roo-Code/"},{"title":"Should I stick with Roo or make the switch to Claude Code? - Yo Motherboard","url":"https://yomotherboard.com/question/should-i-stick-with-roo-or-make-the-switch-to-claude-code/"},{"title":"Claude Code vs. Roo Code Comparison","url":"https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Claude-Code-vs-Roo-Code/"},{"title":"Roo Code vs Cline: Best AI Coding Agents for VS Code (2026)","url":"https://www.qodo.ai/blog/roo-code-vs-cline/"},{"title":"Roo or Cline?

Claude provides /compact which runs faster, but sometimes it's preferred to make Claude write what happened in the current session before killing it and starting a new one.\n\n### Session Handoff Feature Request\n\nCurrently, Claude CLI sessions are stateless. When a session ends, context and pending tasks are lost unless manually documented by the user.(no content)Multi-day workflows require users to manually brief Claude at session start.\n\nA proposed solution involves handoff files that are Claude-specific context (what Claude needs to know), living in the .claude/ directory (gitignored by default, optional to commit), with tighter integration where Claude reads/writes directly without external tools.\n\n### Subagent Handoff Best Practices\n\nGive each subagent one clear goal, input, output, and handoff rule. Keep descriptions action-oriented (\"Use after a spec exists; produce an ADR and guardrails\").(no content)At PubNub, subagents + hooks turn Claude Code from a helpful AI into a repeatable engineering system, enabling faster onboarding, safer automation, and clean handoffs while keeping humans firmly in the loop.\n\n### The Handoff Pattern vs. Tool Delegation\n\nThe handoff pattern represents a different philosophy of agent collaboration compared to tool delegation.

When you do this, Roo will craft an implementation plan that can be referenced by you, but more importantly by future Roo tasks to maintain project context.(no content)Different modes have specific file type restrictions - for example, Architect Mode can only edit files matching the .md extension. After completing architecture planning in Architect mode, Roo switches to Code mode to implement the designed features. When encountering bugs during development, Roo switches from Code mode to Debug mode for systematic troubleshooting.\n\n### Custom Mode Examples\n\n**Technical Writer Mode:**\nYou can create a \"Technical Writer\" mode defined as \"a specialized technical writer focused on creating clear, accessible documentation for developers and end-users\" with expertise in \"technical accuracy, information architecture, and audience-appropriate language.\"\n\n**DevOps Engineer Mode:**\nA \"DevOps Engineer\" mode can be created as \"a DevOps engineer specialized in CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and deployment automation\" that excels at \"creating scalable, maintainable deployment solutions and developer workflows.\"\n\n**Test Engineer Mode:**\nA Test Engineer mode can be created with expertise in \"writing comprehensive test suites, test-driven development, integration testing, and performance testing.\"\n\n### Key Features for Workflows\n\nEach mode—including custom ones—features Sticky Models. This means Roo Code automatically remembers and selects the last model you used with a particular mode. This lets you assign different preferred models to different tasks without constant reconfiguration.(no content)Different modes have different permissions - while Architect mode is read-only on your project, Code mode has access to all tools like editing, terminal commands, and MCPs.

When you do this, Roo will craft an implementation plan that can be referenced by you, but more importantly by future Roo tasks to maintain project context.(no content)Different modes have specific file type restrictions - for example, Architect Mode can only edit files matching the .md extension. After completing architecture planning in Architect mode, Roo switches to Code mode to implement the designed features. When encountering bugs during development, Roo switches from Code mode to Debug mode for systematic troubleshooting.\n\n### Custom Mode Examples\n\n**Technical Writer Mode:**\nYou can create a \"Technical Writer\" mode defined as \"a specialized technical writer focused on creating clear, accessible documentation for developers and end-users\" with expertise in \"technical accuracy, information architecture, and audience-appropriate language.\"\n\n**DevOps Engineer Mode:**\nA \"DevOps Engineer\" mode can be created as \"a DevOps engineer specialized in CI/CD pipelines, infrastructure as code, and deployment automation\" that excels at \"creating scalable, maintainable deployment solutions and developer workflows.\"\n\n**Test Engineer Mode:**\nA Test Engineer mode can be created with expertise in \"writing comprehensive test suites, test-driven development, integration testing, and performance testing.\"\n\n### Key Features for Workflows\n\nEach mode—including custom ones—features Sticky Models. This means Roo Code automatically remembers and selects the last model you used with a particular mode. This lets you assign different preferred models to different tasks without constant reconfiguration.(no content)Different modes have different permissions - while Architect mode is read-only on your project, Code mode has access to all tools like editing, terminal commands, and MCPs. You can configure different AI models and settings to specific modes, like using o3 for architecture planning and Claude Sonnet 4 for code execution.\n\n### Sharing and Collaboration\n\nThe export feature lets you export any mode—and its associated rules—into a single, portable YAML file that you can import into any project. This allows you to package a mode and its rules into one file to easily share with your team.(no content)You can visit the Roo Code Marketplace to browse and install community-contributed modes with a single click.

With Opus-specific caps removed and increased overall limits, Max users have generous all-day Opus 4.5 usage.\n\n## API Pricing\n\nAccording to Anthropic's documentation, the per-token pricing is: Claude Opus 4.5 (most capable): $5.00 per million input tokens, $25.00 per million output tokens. Claude Sonnet 4.5 (balanced): For normal context lengths (≤200K input tokens), $3.00 input / $15.00 output; for \"long-context\" requests (any request with >200K input tokens), $6.00 input / $22.50 output.\n\n## Cost Comparison for Heavy Users\n\nAPI can be more expensive than the subscription-based pricing if you are a heavy user, as the subscription offers more API usage for the price. For example, you can get $150 worth of API usage for the price of $20 a month with a Claude Pro subscription.(no content)When your API base usage exceeds $100/month, it makes more sense to sign up for the subscription. You can also do a hybrid approach; get the cheapest subscription and switch to API usage if you hit the limits.(no content)When running the --view monthly, one user saw that they would have only spent $70.46 if using an API key, when actually paying $100/mo for Claude Max. Granted, the month is not over so they still may end up hypothetically saving money with the subscription, but this view is the only reliable way to make this comparison.\n\n## Key Optimization Strategies\n\nUse Prompt Caching: For Claude Code, caching repetitive inputs can save up to 90% on input token costs. Leverage Batch Processing: Claude Code's batch API offers 50% savings on output tokens, ideal for large-scale tasks.(no content)Heavy Users (API): Without optimization, Claude Code via Anthropic API is cheaper ($13.78 vs. $16.52 for Sonnet 4, $68.86 vs. $82.62 for Opus 4). With prompt caching and batch processing, Claude Code's costs drop significantly (e.g., $5.97 for Sonnet 4).\n\n## Rate Limits (August 2025 Changes)\n\nAnthropic introduced weekly rate limits in August 2025, primarily targeting power users. Designed to curb continuous 24/7 usage leading to unexpectedly high costs, these limits primarily affect less than 5% of users.(no content)Max subscribers can purchase additional usage, beyond what the rate limit provides, at standard API rates.\n\n## Recommendation\n\nI recommend starting with Claude Pro if you're new to Claude Code and already use web Claude. Upgrade to Max or switch to API based on your actual usage patterns after a few weeks of regular development work.(no content)The pay-as-you-go model charges based on the tokens processed, which can exponentially increase costs if not managed correctly.

He highlighted a command called /commit-push-pr, which he invokes dozens of times daily.(no content)Cherny deploys subagents — specialized AI personas — to handle specific phases of the development lifecycle. He uses a code-simplifier to clean up architecture after the main work is done and a verify-app agent to run end-to-end tests before anything ships.\n\n### CLAUDE.md for Team Memory\n\nCherny's team maintains a single file named CLAUDE.md in their git repository. \"Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time.\"(no content)When a human developer reviews a pull request and spots an error, they don't just fix the code; they tag the AI to update its own instructions. The longer the team works together, the smarter the agent becomes.\n\n### Solo Developer Workflows\n\nClaude Code's terminal-based workflow eliminates context switching—the silent productivity killer for solo developers—by integrating directly into the development environment.(no content)One developer reported completing three weeks of planned work within four days of implementing a Claude Code workflow, with weekly story point completion jumping from 14 to 37 — a 164% improvement — while debugging time dropped by 60%.\n\n### GitHub-Based Workflow Pattern\n\nA recommended workflow pattern includes: Plan — Break every feature into granular GitHub issues. Create — Use Claude Code slash-commands to write the code. Test — Run the app's test-suite and headless-browser checks. Deploy — Merge the PR; the host auto-deploys.(no content)Best practices include refining each issue manually until a junior dev could deliver it, keeping scopes tiny (think \"add password reset email\" not \"build auth\"), and storing research & sub-tasks in a /scratchpads folder for agent recall.\n\n### Team Scaling Challenges\n\nOnce an engineer masters Claude Code, their productivity gains are so substantial that the real challenge becomes organizational—scaling these workflows across entire teams. \"Once you have multiple people on your team shipping AI-written code, you have a completely different type of problem... You have to rewire everything about how your team builds software.\"\n\nNote: The search results did not specifically mention \"Roo Code\" - most results focused on Claude Code workflows and solo developer productivity patterns.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"8f221839-43ab-4af6-8b93-7b2c203d87b3","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:44:57.315Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"team development Claude Code Roo Code solo developer workflow","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01VGwqVx7MJPWqtW6t9WWW1Y","content":[{"title":"CLAUDE MD Solo","url":"https://github.com/ruvnet/claude-flow/wiki/CLAUDE-MD-Solo"},{"title":"Creator of Claude Code Reveals His Workflow - Slashdot","url":"https://developers.slashdot.org/story/26/01/06/2239243/creator-of-claude-code-reveals-his-workflow"},{"title":"From Overwhelmed to Overdelivering: How Claude Code Saved My Solo Project When Nothing Else Worked | by Raymond Brunell | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@raymond_44620/from-overwhelmed-to-overdelivering-how-claude-code-saved-my-solo-project-when-nothing-else-worked-bea613380936"},{"title":"Unlocking Solo-Dev Superpowers with Claude Code and GitHub Flow | by Nuttakit Kundum | Medium","url":"https://nuttakitkundum.medium.com/unlocking-solo-dev-superpowers-with-claude-code-and-github-flow-991978f7543b"},{"title":"The creator of Claude Code just revealed his workflow, and developers are losing their minds | VentureBeat","url":"https://venturebeat.com/technology/the-creator-of-claude-code-just-revealed-his-workflow-and-developers-are"},{"title":"Claude Code Workflow : Streamline Your AI Development Process - Geeky Gadgets","url":"https://www.geeky-gadgets.com/anthropics-claude-code-workflow-2025/"},{"title":"A developer's guide to Claude Code workflow automation in 2025","url":"https://www.eesel.ai/blog/claude-code-workflow-automation"},{"title":"The Complete Claude Code Operator’s Guide: Transform Your Development Workflow with AI | by Le Hai Chau | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@lhc1990/the-complete-claude-code-operators-guide-transform-your-development-workflow-with-ai-f29cd4a31e58"},{"title":"GitHub - automazeio/ccpm: Project management system for Claude Code using GitHub Issues and Git worktrees for parallel agent execution.","url":"https://github.com/automazeio/ccpm"},{"title":"How three YC startups built their companies with Claude Code | Claude","url":"https://claude.com/blog/building-companies-with-claude-code"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about team development, Claude Code, Roo Code, and solo developer workflows:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### Claude Code Creator's Workflow (Boris Cherny)\n\nBoris Cherny, the creator of Claude Code at Anthropic, revealed a workflow that uses parallel AI agents, verification loops, and shared memory to let one developer operate with the output of an entire engineering team.(no content)Cherny uses slash commands — custom shortcuts checked into the project's repository — to handle complex operations with a single keystroke.

The longer the team works together, the smarter the agent becomes.\n\n### Solo Developer Workflows\n\nClaude Code's terminal-based workflow eliminates context switching—the silent productivity killer for solo developers—by integrating directly into the development environment.(no content)One developer reported completing three weeks of planned work within four days of implementing a Claude Code workflow, with weekly story point completion jumping from 14 to 37 — a 164% improvement — while debugging time dropped by 60%.\n\n### GitHub-Based Workflow Pattern\n\nA recommended workflow pattern includes: Plan — Break every feature into granular GitHub issues. Create — Use Claude Code slash-commands to write the code. Test — Run the app's test-suite and headless-browser checks. Deploy — Merge the PR; the host auto-deploys.(no content)Best practices include refining each issue manually until a junior dev could deliver it, keeping scopes tiny (think \"add password reset email\" not \"build auth\"), and storing research & sub-tasks in a /scratchpads folder for agent recall.\n\n### Team Scaling Challenges\n\nOnce an engineer masters Claude Code, their productivity gains are so substantial that the real challenge becomes organizational—scaling these workflows across entire teams. \"Once you have multiple people on your team shipping AI-written code, you have a completely different type of problem... You have to rewire everything about how your team builds software.\"\n\nNote: The search results did not specifically mention \"Roo Code\" - most results focused on Claude Code workflows and solo developer productivity patterns."],"durationSeconds":25.967739375002683}}

Pattern Inconsistency\nEvery time developers ask Claude to create a new model or controller, it can be like working with a different developer - with no adherence to conventions and mixed patterns within the same codebase. One file might use service objects, while the next stuffs everything into fat models.\n\n### 2. Ignoring Existing Code Patterns\nClaude doesn't automatically know your existing patterns. Ask for user authentication and it might create a whole new system instead of using your established AuthenticationService. Need error handling? New approach every time, ignoring standardized error classes.\n\n### 3. Context Window Problems\nThe agent can forget project requirements by its third response, switch between different implementations (like JWT to OAuth to session-based auth), and every correction pushes earlier context out of the window, creating \"architectural amnesia.\" Keeping the main agent in pure orchestration mode prevents accumulation of implementation noise.\n\n### 4. Test Modification Issues\nClaude Code is not bashful about modifying tests to be less specific or worse, changing the test to assert the implemented (wrong) behavior. When challenged, it will often say \"this is how it should work anyway.\" Be very wary of changes to test files.\n\n### 5. Jumping Into Code Without Planning\nJumping straight into code is an anti-pattern - it's like building a house without blueprints, fast at first, but problems emerge quickly. Use Shift+tab keys to switch between Claude Code planning mode and normal mode.\n\n## Best Practices and Tips\n\n### CLAUDE.md Configuration\nYour CLAUDE.md files become part of Claude's prompts, so they should be refined like any frequently used prompt. A common mistake is adding extensive content without iterating on its effectiveness. Take time to experiment and determine what produces the best instruction following from the model.(no content)Whenever Claude makes a mistake, add a rule to CLAUDE.md to prevent it from happening again. In pull requests, tag @claude and let a GitHub Action update CLAUDE.md directly during code review. Claude auto-loads CLAUDE.md at the start of every session, ensuring persistent improvement.\n\n### Use Test-Driven Development\nIt's recommended to use Claude Code in a \"test driven development\" fashion by having it write the tests first. Then, spend a bit more time than usual in review of the generated tests.\n\n### Leverage Sub-agents\nOne Claude session for everything leads to \"context pollution\" where concerns bleed together and conversations become unfocused. The solution is to deploy specialized sub-agents with single, well-defined purposes.(no content)Using subagents to verify details or investigate particular questions, especially early on in a conversation or task, tends to preserve context availability without much downside in terms of lost efficiency.\n\n### Efficient Command Usage\nDon't waste tokens asking Claude to run commands. The ! prefix executes bash instantly and injects output into context. No model processing, no delay, no wasted tokens - the output goes straight into context.\n\n### Context Management\nClaude Code is definitely dumber after context compaction. It doesn't know what files it was looking at and needs to re-read them. It will make mistakes you specifically corrected again earlier in the session.(no content)You can trigger compaction manually with the /compact command, so if you notice Claude Code getting lost, it's a good thing to try.\n\n### Use Hooks for Enterprise Repos\nHooks are critical for steering Claude in a complex enterprise repo. They are the deterministic \"must-do\" rules that complement the \"should-do\" suggestions in CLAUDE.md.\n\n### Be Explicit About Patterns\nShow exact patterns to follow, list specific anti-patterns to avoid, and leave no room for interpretation - explicit is better than implicit.(no content)Claude Code is a powerful tool that amplifies both good and bad practices. The most successful users obsess over context management (it's the primary failure mode), plan rigorously before coding (vibe coding creates technical debt), and keep systems simple.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5f3f8d39-4317-4f4e-bfb4-8a0a666c32ea","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:45:05.111Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Claude Code mistakes anti-patterns avoid developers tips 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01BQMqQs7oETshdvnpv71gYj","content":[{"title":"Brandon Casci - From Chaos to Control: How I Taught Claude Code to be Consistent and Accurate","url":"https://www.brandoncasci.com/2025/07/30/from-chaos-to-control-teaching-claude-code-consistency.html"},{"title":"10 Claude Code Productivity Tips For Every Developer in 2026","url":"https://www.f22labs.com/blogs/10-claude-code-productivity-tips-for-every-developer/"},{"title":"Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices"},{"title":"How I Use Every Claude Code Feature - by Shrivu Shankar","url":"https://blog.sshh.io/p/how-i-use-every-claude-code-feature"},{"title":"Claude Code Gotchas | DoltHub Blog","url":"https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-30-claude-code-gotchas/"},{"title":"The Ultimate Claude Code Tips Collection (Advent of Claude 2025) - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/damogallagher/the-ultimate-claude-code-tips-collection-advent-of-claude-2025-5b73"},{"title":"Claude Code Prompt Guidelines Enforcement (Feature) · Issue #427 · anthropics/claude-code","url":"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/427"},{"title":"Claude Code Best Practices · Claude Code Best Practices","url":"https://rosmur.github.io/claudecode-best-practices/"},{"title":"Why Developers Kill Their Claude Code Agents | Medium","url":"https://alirezarezvani.medium.com/97-of-developers-kill-their-claude-code-agents-in-the-first-10-minutes-heres-how-the-3-build-d2b6913f4cb2"},{"title":"Claude Code Tips: for Dev and Non-Dev tasks","url":"https://thecreatorsai.com/p/claude-code-tips-for-dev-and-non"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive overview of Claude Code mistakes, anti-patterns, and tips for developers:\n\n## Common Mistakes and Anti-Patterns\n\n### 1.

Its agentic command-line interface makes it feel like an intelligent collaborator embedded in your workflow.\n- Claude Code is a polished, terminal-based assistant tied to the Claude ecosystem.\n\n**Roo Code:**\n- Roo Code is the scrappy, open-source underdog that lives right inside your VS Code editor. It started as a fork of another tool called Cline, but it has evolved into a full-blown AI agent that can read & write files, run terminal commands, and even browse the web, all from a sidebar in your IDE.\n- Roo is \"model-agnostic.\" That means you \"bring your own key\" (BYOK) and can plug in whatever AI model you want – GPT-4, Gemini, and, yes, even Claude.\n- Roo Code is compatible with a wide array of OpenAI-compatible or custom models and APIs and offers several customizable modes, including Code Mode for standard coding tasks, Architect Mode for system design, Ask Mode for inquiries, Debug Mode for troubleshooting, and tailored Custom Modes for specific functions.\n\n### Pricing Models\n\nPricing models differ fundamentally—Claude Code offers predictable subscription costs while Roo Code requires you to manage your own API spending.\n\n- For Claude Code, if you are a solo dev, Anthropic Pro subscription for $20 per month will get you very far.\n- Real-world testing shows Roo Code consumes approximately $50 USD in tokens for comprehensive feature testing. This direct-cost model appeals to developers who want complete control over their spending and prefer paying for exactly what they use.\n\n### Performance\n\nPerformance differences are minimal since Roo Code uses Claude's models in the backend, but Claude Code's 77.2% SWE-bench success rate represents leading-edge accuracy.\n\n### When to Choose Each Tool\n\n**Choose Claude Code if:**\n- You need a highly reliable, enterprise-grade tool. You love the command line and want to automate AI tasks in your scripts and CI/CD pipelines. You're working primarily with modern web stacks and want top-tier performance without a lot of tinkering.\n- You work across multiple environments and need flexibility. You want predictable monthly costs without worrying about API consumption. You value industry-leading performance metrics and want the most accurate code generation. You appreciate CLI integration and automation capabilities.\n\n**Choose Roo Code if:**\n- Roo Code excels in the VSCode environment, where it integrates beautifully with your existing workflow.\n- Roo Code optimizes for VSCode users with native integration, transparent token tracking, and a pay-per-use model that appeals to budget-conscious developers.\n\n### Using Both Tools Together\n\nSome of the smartest devs use both. They use Roo for the day-to-day, in-the-editor coding and architectural planning. Then, they break out Claude Code for specific, high-powered tasks or for automation.\n\n### User Experience\n\nSome users have moved from Roo to Claude Code and found it simpler, noting it works great within Cursor and is \"just a more reliable tool... especially with tool calls and applying diffs.\"\n\nThe search results don't provide specific comparisons for mobile development use cases, but both tools are general-purpose AI coding assistants that would work across web development, backend, and mobile development workflows.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"48f25b2e-319d-46e4-9799-a9aee3b7a336","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:45:08.605Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Claude Code vs Roo Code web development backend mobile development comparison","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01CFyTzM8Cu9UewRXAqPukYS","content":[{"title":"Roo vs. Claude Code: Best AI for Large, Complex Codebases","url":"https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases"},{"title":"Compare Claude Code vs. Roo Code in 2026","url":"https://slashdot.org/software/comparison/Claude-Code-vs-Roo-Code/"},{"title":"Claude Code vs Roo Code: Features, Pricing and User Reviews 2025","url":"https://toolquestor.com/vs/claude-code-vs-roo-code"},{"title":"Claude Code vs. Roo Code Comparison","url":"https://sourceforge.net/software/compare/Claude-Code-vs-Roo-Code/"},{"title":"Claude Code versus Roo Code Which AI Coding Tool Is Right for You? | berryhill.dev","url":"https://berryhill.dev/posts/claude-code-versus-roo-code-which-ai-coding-tool-is-right-for-you"},{"title":"Compare Roo Code vs. Claude Code - 2025","url":"https://topbusinesssoftware.com/compare/Roo-Code-vs-Claude-Code/"},{"title":"Roo Code vs Claude Code Comparison in 2025 - Aitoolnet","url":"https://www.aitoolnet.com/compare/roo-code-vs-claude-code"},{"title":"10 Claude Code Alternatives That Every Developer Must Use - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/therealmrmumba/10-claude-code-alternatives-that-every-developer-must-use-4ffd"},{"title":"AI Coding Tools: What Works (and What Doesn’t) for Me | by Aleksandar Mirilovic | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@amirilovic/ai-coding-tools-what-works-and-what-doesnt-for-me-56be3d3c1018"},{"title":"Is Claude Code a Better Option than Roo Code for Context Management? - Yo Motherboard","url":"https://yomotherboard.com/question/is-claude-code-a-better-option-than-roo-code-for-context-management/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a comparison between Claude Code and Roo Code for web development, backend, and mobile development:\n\n## Claude Code vs Roo Code Comparison\n\n### Overview\n\nTwo of the biggest names in the AI coding assistant game right now are Roo Code and Claude Code.(no content)They both claim to be able to help you untangle the gnarliest of code, but they go about it in very different ways.\n\n### Core Differences\n\n**Claude Code:**\n- Claude Code is an agentic coding tool that lives in your terminal, understands your codebase, and helps you code faster by executing routine tasks, explaining complex code, and handling git workflows - all through natural language commands.\n- With support for models like Claude 3.5 Sonnet and Claude 3 Opus, it delivers contextual reasoning and multi-file understanding unmatched by typical copilots.

When you do this, Roo will craft an implementation plan that can be referenced by you, but more importantly by future Roo tasks to maintain project context.\n\n**Code Mode:**\n- Code mode has access to all tools like editing, terminal commands, and MCPs.\n- Code Mode generates actual code based on the designs and plans.\n\n## Workflow Best Practices\n\n### Starting with Architect Mode\nIt's not recommended to ask Roo to do anything you yourself don't know how to do. This may be fine for small things like one-off scripts, but will fall apart if you have to build anything that should be maintained over a long period of time.\n\n### Transitioning Between Modes\nOnce you've completed a task that was planned by the architect mode, you can start a new task and tell Roo to continue implementing the plan. The end of the last task will usually include a recommendation on where to start next if needed.\n\n### Mode Switching\nWhen switching modes, Roo automatically selects that model—no manual selection needed. You can assign different models to different modes (e.g., Gemini 2.5 Preview for Architect mode, Claude Sonnet 3.7 for Code mode).(no content)You can switch modes using slash commands: Type /architect, /ask, /debug, /code, or /orchestrator at the beginning of your message.\n\n### Token Optimization\nConsider only using high Max Tokens / Max Thinking Tokens settings with modes like Architect and Debug, and keeping Code mode at 16k max tokens or less.(no content)Use Sticky Models to assign specialized AI models to different modes (reasoning model for planning, non-reasoning model for coding). Roo automatically switches to each mode's last-used model without manual selection.\n\n### Multi-Model Workflow\nThe power of Roo Code lies in strategically assigning different Large Language Models (LLMs) to specialized \"modes\" within Roo Code, optimizing for performance, cost, and specific task requirements.(no content)The workflow is designed to mimic a highly efficient development team, with each \"mode\" acting as a specialized team member. It helps to start by generating a PRD (Project Requirements Document) and then use another LLM to generate a plan for each stage of the project.\n\n### Custom Modes\nRoo Code allows you to create custom modes to tailor Roo's behavior to specific tasks or workflows. Custom modes can be either global (available across all projects) or project-specific.(no content)You can share custom modes with your team to standardize workflows.\n\n### General Tips\nThe extension's customizable Modes (Architect, Code, etc) keep the models on track and focused on the task at hand, without stepping outside of their boundaries. Lean on them depending on the task you're working on.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b1ec580f-82db-464f-83be-0b14b69dd99b","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:45:36.611Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Roo Code architect mode code mode workflow best practices tutorial","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01FLTAS33c2RU2VxTbQubYLW","content":[{"title":"Using Modes | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/using-modes"},{"title":"Roo Code: A Guide With 7 Practical Examples | DataCamp","url":"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/roo-code"},{"title":"Customizing Modes | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/features/custom-modes"},{"title":"Roo Custom Modes - This Dot Labs","url":"https://www.thisdot.co/blog/roo-custom-modes"},{"title":"GitHub - RooCodeInc/Roo-Code: Roo Code gives you a whole dev team of AI agents in your code editor.","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code"},{"title":"How I Effectively Use Roo Code for AI-Assisted Development","url":"https://spin.atomicobject.com/roo-code-ai-assisted-development/"},{"title":"Basic Guide to Roo Code.

It loves to create README.md, CLAUDE.md, project status files, roadmaps, etc.\n- One developer notes they have a React component that's 18,000 lines long, and no AI agent has ever successfully updated this file except Claude Code.\n\n**Cursor Strengths:**\n- Cursor is great as a scaffolder. When the job is big, it's great at laying down structure. Plan Mode breaks the work into steps, proposes file-by-file edits, and nudges toward tests. It's opinionated in a way that makes large changes feel less like a cliff, more like a staircase.\n- Cursor is a standalone, AI-augmented IDE forked from VS Code. It offers natural-language prompts, deep codebase querying, smart refactoring, and inline autocomplete.\n\n**Roo Code (Cline Fork):**\n- Roo Code (fork of Cline) is a VSCode Extension that's getting more and more popular. It's open-source, doesn't opine about the models, fully customizable, and has a really nice agent as well.\n- You can plug your OpenRouter keys, Anthropic keys, and even connect it to Claude Code. Mode Switching is a killer feature—you can Plan in the Architect mode, make it perfect, and then it will switch automatically to the Code mode and start executing the task.\n\n### Practical Combined Workflow Strategies\n\nOne approach: give both sides the same prompt or plan, watch two minds work, then diff their opinions.(no content)Another workflow: Running Cursor with the $20/month plan combined with Claude Code ($100/month) as a terminal editor. This setup gives you the best of both worlds—use Cursor's embedded models for simple questions about your codebase that don't need heavy reasoning, saving Claude Code tokens for the actual complex development work.(no content)A hybrid approach: prototype in Cursor for speed, then validate and produce an audited explanation using Claude for client deliverables. This combo gives both velocity and traceability.\n\n### Setup Recommendations\n\nSet up and integrate both tools efficiently using environment consistency, API authentication, and project context files like CLAUDE.md to maximize AI accuracy.(no content)For setup: Install Claude Code extension from Anthropic ($20/month Pro subscription includes Code usage, or Max $100 for brief coding project bursts).

Workflows are based off applied learnings from our AI-native startup.\",\"url\":\"https://github.com/OneRedOak/claude-code-workflows\"}]\n\nBased on my search, I found extensive information about Claude Code developer workflows, examples, and case studies. Here's a summary:\n\n## Official Resources & Best Practices\n\nClaude Code is a command line tool for agentic coding developed as a research project to give Anthropic engineers and researchers a more native way to integrate Claude into their coding workflows. It is intentionally low-level and unopinionated, providing close to raw model access without forcing specific workflows.\n\n### Key Workflows from Anthropic\n\nTest-driven development (TDD) is an Anthropic-favorite workflow for changes that are easily verifiable with tests. Ask Claude to write tests based on expected input/output pairs, and be explicit about doing TDD so it avoids creating mock implementations.(no content)For parallel development, Git worktrees work well with Claude Code—each worktree has its own independent file state, making it perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions where changes in one worktree won't affect others.\n\n## Real Developer Workflow Examples\n\n### Creator's Workflow (Boris Cherny)\nThe Claude Code creator's team maintains a single file named CLAUDE.md in their git repository. \"Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time.\"(no content)He uses slash commands—custom shortcuts checked into the project's repository—to handle complex operations with a single keystroke, including a command called /commit-push-pr which he invokes dozens of times daily.(no content)\"Claude tests every single change I land to claude.ai/code using the Claude Chrome extension. It opens a browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works.\" He argues that giving the AI a way to verify its own work improves quality by \"2-3x.\"\n\n### Real Project Examples\n\nOne developer reported that for most tasks (5-8 steps) on their 16x Writer project, Claude Code was able to complete the task in one session within the context limit, though it still struggles with UI-related debugging like e2e testing.(no content)Another developer tested Claude Code in a Turbo + Next.js monorepo environment with multiple deployable apps, shared packages, infrastructure code, and common tooling.\n\n### JIRA/Linear Integration\nSome teams connect Claude Code to their ticket system via MCP servers.

Here's a summary:\n\n## Official Resources & Best Practices\n\nClaude Code is a command line tool for agentic coding developed as a research project to give Anthropic engineers and researchers a more native way to integrate Claude into their coding workflows. It is intentionally low-level and unopinionated, providing close to raw model access without forcing specific workflows.\n\n### Key Workflows from Anthropic\n\nTest-driven development (TDD) is an Anthropic-favorite workflow for changes that are easily verifiable with tests. Ask Claude to write tests based on expected input/output pairs, and be explicit about doing TDD so it avoids creating mock implementations.(no content)For parallel development, Git worktrees work well with Claude Code—each worktree has its own independent file state, making it perfect for parallel Claude Code sessions where changes in one worktree won't affect others.\n\n## Real Developer Workflow Examples\n\n### Creator's Workflow (Boris Cherny)\nThe Claude Code creator's team maintains a single file named CLAUDE.md in their git repository. \"Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time.\"(no content)He uses slash commands—custom shortcuts checked into the project's repository—to handle complex operations with a single keystroke, including a command called /commit-push-pr which he invokes dozens of times daily.(no content)\"Claude tests every single change I land to claude.ai/code using the Claude Chrome extension. It opens a browser, tests the UI, and iterates until the code works.\" He argues that giving the AI a way to verify its own work improves quality by \"2-3x.\"\n\n### Real Project Examples\n\nOne developer reported that for most tasks (5-8 steps) on their 16x Writer project, Claude Code was able to complete the task in one session within the context limit, though it still struggles with UI-related debugging like e2e testing.(no content)Another developer tested Claude Code in a Turbo + Next.js monorepo environment with multiple deployable apps, shared packages, infrastructure code, and common tooling.\n\n### JIRA/Linear Integration\nSome teams connect Claude Code to their ticket system via MCP servers. Claude can read the ticket, understand the requirements, implement the feature, update the ticket status, and even create new tickets if it finds bugs. The /ticket command handles the entire workflow.\n\n### Automated Code Review Workflows\nTeams have implemented code review agents that Claude runs after changes are made, following detailed checklists covering TypeScript strict mode, error handling, and more. When a PR goes up, GitHub Actions do a full PR review automatically.(no content)An automated code review system inspired by Anthropic's process implements dual-loop architecture with slash commands and GitHub Actions to automatically review PRs for syntax, completeness, style guide adherence, and bug detection.\n\n## Community Resources & Tools\n\nThere's an \"awesome-claude-code\" curated list of slash-commands, CLAUDE.md files, CLI tools, and other resources for enhancing Claude Code workflows to help the community share knowledge and best practices.\n\nKey community projects include:\n- /tdd commands for Test-Driven Development principles, enforcing Red-Green-Refactor discipline\n- Spec-driven development workflows (Requirements → Design → Tasks → Implementation) and streamlined bug fix workflows (Report → Analyze → Fix → Verify)\n- Ralph for Claude Code - an autonomous AI development framework enabling iterative work with safety guardrails to prevent infinite loops\n\n## Case Study Claims\n\nOne case study site claims: \"Claude Code transformed our development process. What would have taken 2 years was completed in 6 months with higher quality than we ever imagined.\""],"durationSeconds":44.55407795799523}}

Connect MCP servers via project config, global config, or checked-in `.mcp.json` files.\n\n---\n\n## Effective Workflows\n\n**Explore → Plan → Code → Commit**\n1. Have Claude read relevant files without writing code initially\n2. Request planning with thinking modes (\"think\" through \"ultrathink\" for increased computation)\n3.

Provide screenshot capability (Puppeteer MCP, iOS simulator MCP, or manual pasting)\n2. Share design mocks\n3. Have Claude implement, screenshot, and iterate\n4. Commit when satisfied\n\nMultiple iterations typically yield significantly better results than first attempts.\n\n**Safe YOLO Mode**\nUse `claude --dangerously-skip-permissions` for uninterrupted work on safe tasks (lint fixes, boilerplate generation). Only in containerized environments without internet access.\n\n---\n\n## Optimization Techniques\n\n**Be Specific in Instructions**\nVague requests like \"add tests for foo.py\" underperform. Instead: \"write a new test case for foo.py covering the edge case where the user is logged out, avoid mocks.\"\n\nClarity on first attempt reduces course corrections.\n\n**Provide Visual Context**\n- Paste screenshots (cmd+ctrl+shift+4 on macOS, then ctrl+v)\n- Drag-drop images directly\n- Reference image file paths\n\nCritical for UI development and visual analysis tasks.\n\n**Reference Files and URLs**\n- Tab-complete to quickly reference repository resources\n- Paste URLs for Claude to fetch and read\n- Use `/permissions` to allowlist domains and avoid repeated prompts\n\n**Course Correction Tools**\n- Plan before coding; require approval before implementation\n- Press Escape to interrupt any phase while preserving context\n- Double-tap Escape to jump back in history and explore alternatives\n- Request undo operations when needed\n\n**Context Management**\nUse `/clear` frequently during long sessions to reset context window. Improves performance and prevents distraction from irrelevant conversation.\n\n**Checklists for Complex Tasks**\nFor migrations, bulk lint fixes, or complex scripts, have Claude write errors to a Markdown checklist, then fix issues one-by-one while checking off progress.\n\n**Data Input Methods**\n- Copy/paste directly (most common)\n- Pipe into Claude Code (`cat foo.txt | claude`)\n- Request Claude pull data via bash, MCP tools, or custom commands\n- Have Claude read files or fetch URLs (including images)\n\n---\n\n## Common Workflows by Use Case\n\n**Codebase Onboarding**\nAsk conversational questions as you would during pair programming: \"How does logging work?\" Claude explores the codebase agentically. No special prompting needed. This has become Anthropic's core onboarding method.\n\n**Git Operations**\n- Search git history to answer design questions\n- Generate contextual commit messages\n- Handle complex operations (reverts, rebase conflicts, patch grafting)\n- Many Anthropic engineers use Claude for 90%+ of git interactions\n\n**GitHub Interactions**\n- Create PRs using \"pr\" shorthand\n- Implement one-shot fixes for code review comments\n- Fix failing builds or linter warnings\n- Categorize and triage open issues\n\n**Jupyter Notebooks**\nOpen Claude Code and .ipynb files side-by-side in VS Code. Claude can interpret outputs including images. Request aesthetic improvements before sharing with colleagues—explicitly mentioning \"aesthetically pleasing\" helps.\n\n---\n\n## Multi-Claude Workflows\n\n**Parallel Review Process**\n1. Claude writes code\n2. `/clear` or new terminal with second Claude\n3. Second Claude reviews/tests first Claude's work\n4. Third Claude (or /clear again) refines based on feedback\n\nSeparation of context often yields better results than single-Claude execution.\n\n**Multiple Repository Checkouts**\n- Create 3-4 git checkouts in separate folders\n- Open each in terminal tabs\n- Start Claude in each with different tasks\n- Cycle through to approve/deny permissions\n\n**Git Worktrees** (Preferred)\n- `git worktree add ../project-feature-a feature-a`\n- `cd ../project-feature-a && claude`\n- Lighter weight than multiple checkouts\n- Enables independent concurrent tasks\n\nTips: Use consistent naming, maintain one tab per worktree, enable iTerm2 notifications, separate IDE windows per worktree, cleanup with `git worktree remove`.\n\n---\n\n## Headless Mode & Automation\n\n**Basic Usage**\nUse `-p` flag with prompt for non-interactive contexts. Add `--output-format stream-json` for structured output.\n\nNote: Headless mode doesn't persist between sessions.\n\n**Fanning Out Pattern**\nFor large migrations/analyses (2k+ files):\n1. Have Claude generate task list\n2. Loop through tasks, calling Claude programmatically with specific task and allowed tools\n3. Refine prompt iteratively\n\nExample: `claude -p \"migrate foo.py from React to Vue...\"`\n\n**Pipelining Pattern**\nIntegrate into existing data pipelines:\n```\nclaude -p \"<prompt>\" --json | your_command\n```\n\nUse `--verbose` flag for debugging; turn off in production.\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns & Gotchas\n\n- **Skipping planning**: Jumping straight to coding reduces solution quality for complex problems\n- **Over-broad CLAUDE.md files**: Add content iteratively; test effectiveness before keeping\n- **Ignoring context windows**: Long sessions degrade performance; use `/clear` between tasks\n- **Missing visual targets**: Claude iterates better with tests, screenshots, or mocks as reference points\n- **Vague instructions**: Generic requests underperform; be specific about constraints and edge cases\n- **Single-Claude large tasks**: Breaking work across multiple Claude instances often improves quality\n\n---\n\n## Key Principles\n\n1. **Flexibility over prescription**: No single \"right\" workflow; adapt based on task type\n2. **Iteration as strength**: 2-3 iterations typically beat first-pass solutions\n3. **Context as currency**: Explicit instructions and visual references maximize effectiveness\n4. **Separation of concerns**: Multiple Claude instances on independent tasks reduces errors\n5. **Safety by default**: Conservative permissions reduce risk; whitelist safe operations"}]},"uuid":"41881023-e665-4642-b319-45ad094615e7","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:47:17.525Z","toolUseResult":{"bytes":234860,"code":200,"codeText":"OK","result":"# Claude Code Best Practices Guide\n\n## Setup & Configuration\n\n**CLAUDE.md Files**\nCreate special markdown files to document project-specific context.

Instead: \"write a new test case for foo.py covering the edge case where the user is logged out, avoid mocks.\"\n\nClarity on first attempt reduces course corrections.\n\n**Provide Visual Context**\n- Paste screenshots (cmd+ctrl+shift+4 on macOS, then ctrl+v)\n- Drag-drop images directly\n- Reference image file paths\n\nCritical for UI development and visual analysis tasks.\n\n**Reference Files and URLs**\n- Tab-complete to quickly reference repository resources\n- Paste URLs for Claude to fetch and read\n- Use `/permissions` to allowlist domains and avoid repeated prompts\n\n**Course Correction Tools**\n- Plan before coding; require approval before implementation\n- Press Escape to interrupt any phase while preserving context\n- Double-tap Escape to jump back in history and explore alternatives\n- Request undo operations when needed\n\n**Context Management**\nUse `/clear` frequently during long sessions to reset context window. Improves performance and prevents distraction from irrelevant conversation.\n\n**Checklists for Complex Tasks**\nFor migrations, bulk lint fixes, or complex scripts, have Claude write errors to a Markdown checklist, then fix issues one-by-one while checking off progress.\n\n**Data Input Methods**\n- Copy/paste directly (most common)\n- Pipe into Claude Code (`cat foo.txt | claude`)\n- Request Claude pull data via bash, MCP tools, or custom commands\n- Have Claude read files or fetch URLs (including images)\n\n---\n\n## Common Workflows by Use Case\n\n**Codebase Onboarding**\nAsk conversational questions as you would during pair programming: \"How does logging work?\" Claude explores the codebase agentically. No special prompting needed. This has become Anthropic's core onboarding method.\n\n**Git Operations**\n- Search git history to answer design questions\n- Generate contextual commit messages\n- Handle complex operations (reverts, rebase conflicts, patch grafting)\n- Many Anthropic engineers use Claude for 90%+ of git interactions\n\n**GitHub Interactions**\n- Create PRs using \"pr\" shorthand\n- Implement one-shot fixes for code review comments\n- Fix failing builds or linter warnings\n- Categorize and triage open issues\n\n**Jupyter Notebooks**\nOpen Claude Code and .ipynb files side-by-side in VS Code. Claude can interpret outputs including images. Request aesthetic improvements before sharing with colleagues—explicitly mentioning \"aesthetically pleasing\" helps.\n\n---\n\n## Multi-Claude Workflows\n\n**Parallel Review Process**\n1. Claude writes code\n2. `/clear` or new terminal with second Claude\n3. Second Claude reviews/tests first Claude's work\n4. Third Claude (or /clear again) refines based on feedback\n\nSeparation of context often yields better results than single-Claude execution.\n\n**Multiple Repository Checkouts**\n- Create 3-4 git checkouts in separate folders\n- Open each in terminal tabs\n- Start Claude in each with different tasks\n- Cycle through to approve/deny permissions\n\n**Git Worktrees** (Preferred)\n- `git worktree add ../project-feature-a feature-a`\n- `cd ../project-feature-a && claude`\n- Lighter weight than multiple checkouts\n- Enables independent concurrent tasks\n\nTips: Use consistent naming, maintain one tab per worktree, enable iTerm2 notifications, separate IDE windows per worktree, cleanup with `git worktree remove`.\n\n---\n\n## Headless Mode & Automation\n\n**Basic Usage**\nUse `-p` flag with prompt for non-interactive contexts. Add `--output-format stream-json` for structured output.\n\nNote: Headless mode doesn't persist between sessions.\n\n**Fanning Out Pattern**\nFor large migrations/analyses (2k+ files):\n1. Have Claude generate task list\n2. Loop through tasks, calling Claude programmatically with specific task and allowed tools\n3. Refine prompt iteratively\n\nExample: `claude -p \"migrate foo.py from React to Vue...\"`\n\n**Pipelining Pattern**\nIntegrate into existing data pipelines:\n```\nclaude -p \"<prompt>\" --json | your_command\n```\n\nUse `--verbose` flag for debugging; turn off in production.\n\n---\n\n## Anti-Patterns & Gotchas\n\n- **Skipping planning**: Jumping straight to coding reduces solution quality for complex problems\n- **Over-broad CLAUDE.md files**: Add content iteratively; test effectiveness before keeping\n- **Ignoring context windows**: Long sessions degrade performance; use `/clear` between tasks\n- **Missing visual targets**: Claude iterates better with tests, screenshots, or mocks as reference points\n- **Vague instructions**: Generic requests underperform; be specific about constraints and edge cases\n- **Single-Claude large tasks**: Breaking work across multiple Claude instances often improves quality\n\n---\n\n## Key Principles\n\n1. **Flexibility over prescription**: No single \"right\" workflow; adapt based on task type\n2. **Iteration as strength**: 2-3 iterations typically beat first-pass solutions\n3. **Context as currency**: Explicit instructions and visual references maximize effectiveness\n4. **Separation of concerns**: Multiple Claude instances on independent tasks reduces errors\n5. **Safety by default**: Conservative permissions reduce risk; whitelist safe operations","durationMs":26360,"url":"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices"}}

Let me compile this into a detailed response.\n\n# Practical Workflows Combining Claude Code and Roo Code\n\nBased on extensive research from developer experiences, official documentation, and community discussions, here is a comprehensive guide for developers looking to optimize their workflows with both Claude Code and Roo Code.\n\n---\n\n## 1. How Developers Actually Use Both Tools Together\n\nThe most effective developers treat these tools as complementary rather than competing. According to [Arsturn's comparison](https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases):\n\n**Roo Code for Daily Work:**\n- In-editor exploration and architectural planning\n- Conversational back-and-forth during development\n- Mode switching between Architect and Code phases\n\n**Claude Code for Precision Tasks:**\n- Complex refactoring requiring surgical accuracy\n- CI/CD automation and GitHub Actions integration\n- Terminal-based scripting and batch operations\n\n**Parallel Execution Pattern** (from [Pedro Martins' workflow](https://nikuscs.com/blog/10-ai-workflow-with-claude-code-roocode-gpt/)):\nYou can delegate different tasks to Claude Code, Cursor, and Roo Code simultaneously, provided they do not touch the same files.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Task Handoff Strategies Between Tools\n\n### Context Preservation Methods\n\n**CLAUDE.md Files:**\nTeams maintain a single CLAUDE.md file in their git repository. According to [VentureBeat's coverage](https://venturebeat.com/technology/the-creator-of-claude-code-just-revealed-his-workflow-and-developers-are), \"Anytime we see Claude do something incorrectly we add it to the CLAUDE.md, so Claude knows not to do it next time.\"\n\n**Roo Code Memory Bank:**\nUse Roo's structured memory system (activeContext.md, productContext.md, progress.md, decisionLog.md) to persist context across sessions.\n\n### Smart Handoff Protocol\n\nFrom [Smart Handoff for Claude Code](https://blog.skinnyandbald.com/never-lose-your-flow-smart-handoff-for-claude-code/):\n- Run handoff commands when reaching 60-70% context usage\n- Document current state before context compaction\n- Use `/compact` to trigger manual context refresh when Claude gets lost\n\n### Session Teleportation (Claude Code v2.1.0)\nAccording to [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/orchestration/claude-code-2-1-0-arrives-with-smoother-workflows-and-smarter-agents), the `/teleport` and `/remote-env` commands allow developers to resume sessions between local terminals and web interfaces.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Project Type Recommendations\n\n### Web Development (Frontend)\n| Task | Recommended Tool | Rationale |\n|------|------------------|-----------|\n| Component planning | Roo Code (Architect mode) | Structured planning with mode switching |\n| React/Vue implementation | Either | Both handle modern frameworks well |\n| Complex refactoring | Claude Code | Surgical precision, 77.2% SWE-bench success |\n| UI iteration with screenshots | Claude Code | Superior visual iteration workflow |\n\n### Backend Development\n| Task | Recommended Tool | Rationale |\n|------|------------------|-----------|\n| API design | Roo Code (Architect mode) | Read-only planning phase |\n| Database migrations | Claude Code | Checklist-based execution |\n| CI/CD automation | Claude Code | Scriptable CLI integration |\n| Bug investigation | Roo Code (Debug mode) | Conversational exploration |\n\n### Mobile Development\nBoth tools work for mobile development, though the research shows less specific mobile workflow documentation. General recommendation: use Roo Code for planning and Claude Code for implementation.\n\n### Large/Legacy Codebases\nAccording to [Arsturn](https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases):\n- **Roo Code**: Better for sprawling legacy systems requiring exploration\n- **Claude Code**: Better when you need precise, surgical changes\n\n---\n\n## 4. Language/Framework Specific Recommendations\n\nFrom [ClaudeLog](https://claudelog.com/faqs/what-programming-languages-work-best-with-claude-code/) and [full-stack configuration guides](https://htdocs.dev/posts/claude-code-full-stack-configuration-guide/):\n\n**TypeScript/JavaScript:** Both tools excel here. Claude Code adapts to your existing stack.\n\n**Python:** Strong support in both tools. Claude Code offers LSP integration with pyright.\n\n**React/Next.js:** According to community reports, Claude Code handles complex React files exceptionally well. One developer noted Claude Code successfully updated an 18,000-line React component when no other AI agent could.\n\n**Roo Code Multi-Model Strategy:**\nFrom [Roo Code documentation](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/using-modes):\n- Use reasoning models (o3) for Architect mode\n- Use faster models (Claude Sonnet) for Code mode\n- Configure different Max Tokens for different modes (16k for Code mode recommended)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Team vs Solo Developer Considerations\n\n### Solo Developers\nAccording to [Medium article on Claude Code solo workflow](https://nuttakitkundum.medium.com/unlocking-solo-dev-superpowers-with-claude-code-and-github-flow-991978f7543b):\n- Claude Code eliminates context switching\n- One developer completed three weeks of work in four days\n- 164% improvement in story point completion\n\n**Recommended Pattern:**\n1. Plan in GitHub Issues (granular, junior-dev-deliverable scope)\n2. Use Claude Code slash commands (`/commit-push-pr`)\n3. Store research in `/scratchpads` folder\n\n### Team Development\nFrom [VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/technology/the-creator-of-claude-code-just-revealed-his-workflow-and-developers-are):\n- Maintain shared CLAUDE.md files\n- Tag @claude in PR reviews to update instructions\n- Use GitHub Actions for automated code review\n\n**Scaling Challenge:**\nOnce engineers master Claude Code, the challenge becomes organizational. According to the Claude Code creator: \"You have to rewire everything about how your team builds software.\"\n\n---\n\n## 6. When to Use API Directly vs Subscription Plans\n\n### Cost Thresholds\n\nFrom [Hacker News discussion](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45077941) and [PromptLayer analysis](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-code-pricing-how-to-save-money/):\n\n| Monthly Usage | Recommendation |\n|---------------|----------------|\n| < $20 | API with prompt caching |\n| $20-$100 | Claude Pro subscription ($20/mo) |\n| $100-$200 | Claude Max ($100/mo or $200/mo) |\n| > $200 | API with batch processing + caching |\n\n**Key Insight:** One user tracked their usage with `--view monthly` and found they would have spent only $70.46 on API while paying $100/month for Max.\n\n### Subscription Options\n\nFrom [IntuitionLabs pricing guide](https://intuitionlabs.ai/articles/claude-pricing-plans-api-costs):\n- **Pro**: $20/month - Good starting point\n- **Max 5x**: $100/month - 5x usage limits\n- **Max 20x**: $200/month - Full Opus 4.5 access\n\n### Roo Code Cost Model\nRoo Code uses BYOK (Bring Your Own Key). Real-world testing shows approximately $50 in tokens for comprehensive feature testing according to [Arsturn](https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases).\n\n---\n\n## 7. Cost Optimization Strategies for Heavy Users\n\nFrom [AI Engineering Report](https://www.aiengineering.report/p/the-hidden-costs-of-claude-code-token) and [PromptLayer](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-code-pricing-how-to-save-money/):\n\n### Technical Optimizations\n1. **Prompt Caching**: Save up to 90% on input token costs\n2. **Batch Processing**: 50% savings on output tokens\n3. **Model Selection**: Use Sonnet for routine tasks, Opus for complex reasoning\n\n### Workflow Optimizations\n1. **Use `/clear` frequently** to reset context windows\n2. **Start fresh sessions** rather than persisting through corrections\n3. **Use subagents** to preserve main context\n4. **Delegate simple tasks** to cheaper models in Roo Code\n\n### Hybrid Approach\nFrom [developer recommendations](https://yomotherboard.com/question/should-i-stick-with-roo-or-make-the-switch-to-claude-code/):\nGet the cheapest subscription and switch to API when you hit limits.\n\n---\n\n## 8. Real Workflow Examples\n\n### Example 1: Feature Development (from [Anthropic's best practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices))\n\n**Explore - Plan - Code - Commit:**\n1. Have Claude read relevant files without writing\n2. Request planning with thinking modes\n3. Implement with explicit verification\n4. Commit and update documentation\n\n### Example 2: Test-Driven Development\n\nFrom [Anthropic's TDD workflow](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):\n1. Write tests based on input/output pairs\n2. Confirm tests fail\n3. Commit tests\n4. Implement until tests pass\n5. Commit implementation\n\n### Example 3: Multi-Tool Parallel Workflow\n\nFrom [Pedro Martins](https://nikuscs.com/blog/10-ai-workflow-with-claude-code-roocode-gpt/):\n- Claude Code: Core feature implementation\n- Cursor: Quick single-file edits\n- Roo Code: Architectural planning in Architect mode\n\n### Example 4: Roo Code Mode Progression\n\nFrom [Atomic Object](https://spin.atomicobject.com/roo-code-ai-assisted-development/):\n1. Start in Architect mode for planning\n2. Transition to Code mode: \"Implement the plan described in active context\"\n3. Switch to Debug mode when issues arise\n4. Use `/architect`, `/code`, `/debug` commands\n\n### Example 5: JIRA/Linear Integration\n\nAccording to [awesome-claude-code](https://github.com/hesreallyhim/awesome-claude-code):\nSome teams use MCP servers to connect Claude Code to ticket systems. Claude reads tickets, implements features, updates status, and creates new tickets for discovered bugs.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Common Mistakes and Anti-Patterns to Avoid\n\n### Anti-Pattern 1: Skipping Planning\nFrom [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):\nJumping straight to code is like building without blueprints. Use Shift+Tab to switch to planning mode.\n\n### Anti-Pattern 2: Context Pollution\nFrom [PubNub subagent best practices](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/best-practices-for-claude-code-sub-agents/):\nOne Claude session for everything leads to concerns bleeding together. Deploy specialized subagents.\n\n### Anti-Pattern 3: Ignoring Existing Patterns\nFrom [Brandon Casci's experience](https://www.brandoncasci.com/2025/07/30/from-chaos-to-control-teaching-claude-code-consistency.html):\nClaude doesn't automatically know your patterns. Be explicit about conventions in CLAUDE.md.\n\n### Anti-Pattern 4: Modifying Tests Carelessly\nFrom [DoltHub gotchas](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-30-claude-code-gotchas/):\nClaude Code is not bashful about modifying tests to assert wrong behavior. Review test file changes carefully.\n\n### Anti-Pattern 5: Over-Broad CLAUDE.md Files\nFrom [Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices):\nAdd content iteratively; test effectiveness before keeping.\n\n### Anti-Pattern 6: Not Knowing When to Takeover\nFrom [Atomic Object](https://spin.atomicobject.com/roo-code-ai-assisted-development/):\nWhen Roo struggles repeatedly, stop and takeover manually rather than waiting for self-correction.\n\n### Anti-Pattern 7: Requesting Beyond Your Understanding\nFrom [Atomic Object](https://spin.atomicobject.com/roo-code-ai-assisted-development/):\nDo not ask Roo to do anything you yourself do not know how to do. This prevents unmaintainable code.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Decision Tree for Choosing the Right Tool\n\n### Primary Decision: IDE vs Terminal Preference\n\n```\nStart Here\n    |\n    v\nDo you prefer working in VS Code IDE?\n    |\n    +--[Yes]--> Roo Code as primary, Claude Code for automation\n    |\n    +--[No/Terminal preferred]--> Claude Code as primary\n```\n\n### Task-Type Decision Framework\n\n| Question | If Yes | If No |\n|----------|--------|-------|\n| Is this exploratory/architectural planning? | Roo Code (Architect mode) | Continue |\n| Does it require CI/CD integration? | Claude Code | Continue |\n| Is it a single-file quick edit? | Cursor or Roo Code | Continue |\n| Do you need model flexibility? | Roo Code (BYOK) | Claude Code |\n| Is precision critical (no tolerance for mistakes)? | Claude Code | Either |\n| Are you working with legacy code requiring exploration? | Roo Code | Either |\n\n### When to Use Both Together\n\nFrom [Arsturn](https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases):\n\n**Use Roo Code for:**\n- Day-to-day in-editor coding\n- Architectural planning\n- Conversational exploration\n- Mode-specific workflows\n\n**Use Claude Code for:**\n- High-powered specific tasks\n- Automation and scripting\n- CI/CD pipeline integration\n- Terminal-based batch operations\n\n### Cost-Optimized Decision Path\n\n```\nMonthly AI Coding Budget?\n    |\n    +--[< $20]--> Roo Code with cheaper API models\n    |\n    +--[$20-$50]--> Claude Pro + Roo Code with Sonnet\n    |\n    +--[$50-$100]--> Claude Pro + API overflow\n    |\n    +--[$100+]--> Claude Max or API with batch processing\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary: The Optimal Combined Workflow\n\nBased on all research, here is the recommended workflow for developers using both tools:\n\n1. **Planning Phase**: Use Roo Code in Architect mode for system design and planning documents\n\n2. **Implementation Phase**: \n   - Simple/routine: Roo Code (Code mode)\n   - Complex/precision: Claude Code\n   - Parallel tasks: Distribute across both tools (non-overlapping files)\n\n3. **Review Phase**: Use Claude Code for automated PR reviews via GitHub Actions\n\n4. **Context Management**:\n   - Maintain CLAUDE.md in git for shared learning\n   - Use Roo Code memory bank for session persistence\n   - Clear contexts frequently to prevent degradation\n\n5. **Cost Control**:\n   - Start with Pro subscription\n   - Track usage with `--view monthly`\n   - Adjust based on actual consumption patterns\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [VentureBeat - Claude Code Creator's Workflow](https://venturebeat.com/technology/the-creator-of-claude-code-just-revealed-his-workflow-and-developers-are)\n- [Anthropic - Claude Code Best Practices](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)\n- [Arsturn - Roo vs Claude Code Comparison](https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases)\n- [Pedro Martins - AI Workflow with Claude Code, Roo Code & Cursor](https://nikuscs.com/blog/10-ai-workflow-with-claude-code-roocode-gpt/)\n- [Atomic Object - Using Roo Code Effectively](https://spin.atomicobject.com/roo-code-ai-assisted-development/)\n- [Roo Code Documentation - Custom Modes](https://docs.roocode.com/features/custom-modes)\n- [DoltHub - Claude Code Gotchas](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2025-06-30-claude-code-gotchas/)\n- [PromptLayer - Claude Code Pricing Guide](https://blog.promptlayer.com/claude-code-pricing-how-to-save-money/)\n- [Smart Handoff for Claude Code](https://blog.skinnyandbald.com/never-lose-your-flow-smart-handoff-for-claude-code/)\n- [GitHub - Roo Code Integration Issue](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/4842)\n- [Hacker News - Claude Code Subscription vs API](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=45077941)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":582,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2022,"cache_read_input_tokens":47189,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2022,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWzMSzf5FcdsvydYuf92Y","type":"assistant","uuid":"72d73c90-5cc4-44a8-906e-a3b70a92b6d4","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:48:46.904Z"}
