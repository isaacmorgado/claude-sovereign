I should communicate findings clearly without emojis\n5. The codebase follows modern JavaScript/TypeScript patterns with verbose error handling\n\nThe repository is currently on the `main` branch with some modified files (CLAUDE.md, video-generator) and untracked files/directories (.mcp.json, connection_fix.md, dev-tools/, developer_setup.md, malware_samples/, mcp_fix_instructions.md).\n\nI'm ready to help you search for files, analyze code, find implementations, or explore the codebase structure.
