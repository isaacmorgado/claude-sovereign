PProPanel shows how to render in PPro instead of AME.\"\n\n2. **Exporting Selected Audio Clips**\n   To export a selected audio clip from a sequence: \"Get the sequence selection, set the sequence in/out points to the beginning/end of the trackItem, then render.\"\n\n### Important Resources\n\n- **PProPanel Sample Code**: The official sample that exercises Premiere Pro's ExtendScript API is available at: https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/tree/master/PProPanel\n\n- **API Capabilities**: \"Premiere Pro's ExtendScript-based API allows for broad control of the entire application. ExtendScript can access and manipulate most project elements, including metadata, exporting and rendering options.\"\n\n### Export Settings Available\n\nThe scripting API provides several export-related options:\n- \"The path to which to export the project and media\" and \"The path to the output preset (.epr file) to be used.\"\n- \"If true, include conformed audio files with exported project.\"\n\n### Platform Status\n\n\"As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP; Unified Extensibility Platform...

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)The Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP) has officially graduated from beta and is now available in Adobe Premiere 25.6. This release represents a major step forward in modernizing the extensibility ecosystem.(no content)As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP. ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n## Audio Waveform Data Access\n\nRegarding raw audio data and waveform access specifically, the search results indicate that this functionality is primarily available through the **C++ SDK** rather than the UXP API:\n\nA separate .pek file is always created. This contains peak audio samples for quick access when Premiere needs to draw the audio waveform, for example in the Source Monitor or Timeline panel. Second, the audio may be conformed into a separate .cfa file.\n\n## Sample Resources\n\nInstructions for developing UXP plugins within Premiere Pro are available on GitHub. As of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins. The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.(no content)Adobe has updated their sample code to help developers. The Sample SDK provides practical examples of how to interact with the Premiere API using UXP.\n\n## Key Differences from ExtendScript\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, blocking the UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n**Note:** The search results do not show specific UXP API methods for accessing raw audio sample data or waveform data directly. Low-level audio sample access appears to remain in the domain of the C++ SDK for importers and plugins.

Note: trackItems created from a projectItem will not have their label color updated; any new trackItems created from those projectItems will get the updated label.(no content)An important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, blocking the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread.

Let me compile the final research report.\n\n---\n\n# Premiere Pro UXP Plugin Research: Audio Access and Clip Manipulation\n\n## Question 1: Can UXP plugins access and manipulate audio data directly from timeline clips?\n\n### Direct Answer: NO - Raw audio data access is NOT available via UXP or ExtendScript\n\n**You cannot access raw audio samples/waveform data directly from timeline clips using UXP plugins.** You must export audio to a temporary file first if you need to process the actual audio data.\n\n### What IS Available for Audio via UXP:\n\nThe UXP API provides these audio-related classes, but they control metadata and effects, NOT raw audio samples:\n\n```typescript\n// AudioTrack - control track-level properties\nAudioTrack {\n    setMute(mute: boolean): Promise<boolean>\n    getMediaType(): Promise<Guid>\n    isMuted(): Promise<boolean>\n    getTrackItems(trackItemType: Constants.TrackItemType, \n        includeEmptyTrackItems: boolean): AudioClipTrackItem[]\n}\n\n// AudioClipTrackItem - clip metadata only\nAudioClipTrackItem {\n    getMatchName(): Promise<string>\n    getName(): Promise<string>\n    getInPoint(): Promise<TickTime>\n    getOutPoint(): Promise<TickTime>\n    getComponentChain(): Promise<AudioComponentChain>\n}\n\n// AudioComponentChain - audio effects/filters\nAudioComponentChain {\n    createInsertComponentAction(component: AudioFilterComponent, index: number): Action\n    createAppendComponentAction(component: AudioFilterComponent): Action\n    createRemoveComponentAction(component: AudioFilterComponent): Action\n}\n```\n\n### Workaround for Raw Audio Access:\n\nPer Adobe staff confirmation, the only viable approach is:\n\n1. **Export/render the audio** to a file (MP3, WAV, etc.) using an audio-only export preset\n2. **Import the rendered file** into your plugin\n3. **Process using Web Audio API** or other JavaScript audio libraries\n\n### Export Audio via ExtendScript (still supported until Sept 2026):\n\n```javascript\n// Set in/out points to match clip boundaries\nvar activeSequence = app.project.activeSequence;\nactiveSequence.setInPoint(clipStartTime);\nactiveSequence.setOutPoint(clipEndTime);\n\n// Export using an audio-only preset (.epr file)\napp.encoder.encodeSequence(\n    activeSequence,\n    outputPath,\n    audioOnlyPresetPath,  // e.g., \"AudioOnly_AAC.epr\"\n    app.encoder.ENCODE_IN_TO_OUT\n);\n```\n\n### Official Sources:\n- [Premiere Pro UXP API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [Adobe Community - Audio Buffer Access Discussion](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/extract-audio-buffer-from-premiere-to-extend-script-external-object-c-gt-extend-script/td-p/13156187)\n- [PProPanel Sample - Export Examples](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx)\n\n---\n\n## Question 2: APIs for Modifying Clip Labels, Colors, and Markers via UXP\n\n### Direct Answer: YES - Full API support exists for labels, colors, and markers\n\n### Color Labels API (UXP)\n\n```typescript\n// Available color label indices (0-15)\nenum ProjectItemColorLabel {\n    VIOLET = 0, IRIS = 1, LAVENDER = 2, CERULEAN = 3,\n    FOREST = 4, ROSE = 5, MANGO = 6, PURPLE = 7,\n    BLUE = 8, TEAL = 9, MAGENTA = 10, TAN = 11,\n    GREEN = 12, BROWN = 13, YELLOW = 14, ORANGE = 15\n}\n\n// ProjectItem methods\ngetColorLabelIndex(): Promise<number>\ncreateSetColorLabelAction(inColorLabelIndex: number): Action\n```\n\n**UXP Code Example - Set Color Label:**\n\n```javascript\nconst { app } = require(\"premierepro\");\n\nasync function setClipColorLabel(projectItem, colorIndex) {\n    const project = await app.getProject();\n    \n    await project.lockedAccess(async () => {\n        const action = projectItem.createSetColorLabelAction(colorIndex);\n        \n        await project.executeTransaction(\n            (compoundAction) => {\n                compoundAction.addAction(action);\n            },\n            \"Set Color Label\"\n        );\n    });\n}\n\n// Usage: Set to Cerulean (index 3)\nsetClipColorLabel(myProjectItem, 3);\n```\n\n### Markers API (UXP)\n\n```typescript\n// Marker types\nenum MarkerType { Comment, Chapter, FlvCuePoint, WebLink }\n\n// Marker colors\nenum MarkerColor { GREEN, RED, MAGENTA, ORANGE, YELLOW, BLUE, CYAN }\n\n// Markers class methods\nMarkers {\n    getMarkers(filters?: string[]): Marker[]\n    createAddMarkerAction(Name: string, markerType?: string, \n        startTime?: TickTime, duration?: TickTime, \n        comments?: string): Action\n    createMoveMarkerAction(marker: Marker, tickTime: TickTime): Action\n    createRemoveMarkerAction(marker: Marker): Action\n}\n\n// Individual Marker methods\nMarker {\n    createSetNameAction(name: string): Action\n    createSetColorByIndexAction(colorIndex: number): Action\n    createSetDurationAction(tickTime: TickTime): Action\n    createSetTypeAction(markerType: string): Action\n    createSetCommentsAction(comments: string): Action\n}\n```\n\n**UXP Code Example - Add Marker to Sequence:**\n\n```javascript\nconst { app, Constants } = require(\"premierepro\");\n\nasync function addMarkerToSequence(name, timeInTicks, comments) {\n    const project = await app.getProject();\n    const sequence = await project.getActiveSequence();\n    const markers = await app.getMarkers(sequence);\n    \n    await project.lockedAccess(async () => {\n        const tickTime = { ticks: timeInTicks };\n        const duration = { ticks: 0 };\n        \n        const addAction = markers.createAddMarkerAction(\n            name,           // marker name\n            \"Comment\",      // markerType\n            tickTime,       // startTime\n            duration,       // duration\n            comments        // comments\n        );\n        \n        await project.executeTransaction(\n            (compoundAction) => {\n                compoundAction.addAction(addAction);\n            },\n            \"Add Marker\"\n        );\n    });\n}\n```\n\n**UXP Code Example - Set Marker Color:**\n\n```javascript\nasync function setMarkerColor(marker, colorIndex) {\n    const project = await app.getProject();\n    \n    await project.lockedAccess(async () => {\n        const action = marker.createSetColorByIndexAction(colorIndex);\n        \n        await project.executeTransaction(\n            (compoundAction) => {\n                compoundAction.addAction(action);\n            },\n            \"Set Marker Color\"\n        );\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### ExtendScript Examples (Legacy, supported until Sept 2026)\n\n**Set Color Label:**\n```javascript\n// Get and set color labels on project items\nvar projectItem = app.project.rootItem.children[0];\nvar currentLabel = projectItem.getColorLabel();  // returns 0-15\nprojectItem.setColorLabel(4);  // Set to Cerulean\n```\n\n**Add Markers:**\n```javascript\n// Add marker to active sequence\nvar activeSequence = app.project.activeSequence;\nvar markers = activeSequence.markers;\nvar newMarker = markers.createMarker(12.345);  // time in seconds\nnewMarker.name = \"My Marker\";\nnewMarker.comments = \"Description here\";\nnewMarker.end = newMarker.start.seconds + 5.0;  // 5 second duration\n\n// Add marker to project item (clip)\nvar clipMarkers = projectItem.getMarkers();\nvar clipMarker = clipMarkers.createMarker(5.0);\nclipMarker.name = \"Clip Marker\";\n```\n\n### Important Limitations:\n\n1. **Markers are attached to ProjectItems, not TrackItems**: \"In PPro, all markers and metadata associated with trackItems are actually attached to the backing projectItem; it's not possible to have different markers and metadata for each trackItem.\"\n\n2. **Color labels apply to ProjectItems only**: \"One can only change the label color of projectItems; there's no API to do so, for trackItems.\"\n\n3. **Track items inherit from source**: \"trackItems created from a projectItem will not have their label color updated; any new trackItems created from those projectItems will get the updated label.\"\n\n### Official Sources:\n- [Premiere Pro UXP Markers API](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/markers/)\n- [ProjectItem API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/projectitem/)\n- [ClipProjectItem API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/clipprojectitem/)\n- [TypeScript Definitions](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro Samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [ExtendScript Scripting Guide](https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/)\n- [PProPanel Sample Code](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/jsx/PPRO/Premiere.jsx)\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table\n\n| Capability | UXP Support | ExtendScript Support | Notes |\n|------------|-------------|---------------------|-------|\n| Raw audio sample access | NO | NO | Requires C++ SDK or export-then-process |\n| Audio track mute/properties | YES | YES | |\n| Audio effects/filters | YES | YES | Via AudioComponentChain |\n| Project item color labels | YES | YES | 16 colors (0-15) |\n| Track item color labels | NO | NO | Not exposed in any API |\n| Sequence markers | YES | YES | Full CRUD operations |\n| Clip/ProjectItem markers | YES | YES | Full CRUD operations |\n| Marker colors | YES | YES | 7 colors available |\n\n---\n\n## Key Version Information\n\n- **Premiere Pro v25.6+**: UXP officially supported (released Dec 2025)\n- **UXP Version**: v8.1 (bundled with Premiere v25.6)\n- **ExtendScript**: Supported through September 2026"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":530,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1395,"cache_read_input_tokens":28177,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1395,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWF7BtTYkjgszPXpdXsJT","type":"assistant","uuid":"ff01291f-3821-48ea-89d7-accf1ce39074","timestamp":"2025-12-19T00:35:35.739Z"}
