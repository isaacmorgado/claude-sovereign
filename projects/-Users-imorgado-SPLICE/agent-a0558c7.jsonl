Here's what I found:\n\n## Premiere Pro UXP: lockedAccess and executeTransaction Action Example\n\n### API Definition\n\nThe `executeTransaction` method takes a callback with a `compoundAction` parameter and an optional `undoString`: `executeTransaction(callback: (compoundAction: CompoundAction) => void, undoString?: string): boolean` - this executes an undoable transaction by passing a compound action.(no content)The `lockedAccess` method is defined as: `lockedAccess(callback: () => void): void` - this gets a read/upgrade locked access to the Project, and the project state will not change during the execution of the callback function. You can call `executeTransaction` while having locked access.\n\n### Practical Example\n\nHere's a working code example from the Adobe community showing how to use these methods together:\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"premierepro\");\n\nasync function insertItem() {\n    try {\n        const project = await app.Project.getActiveProject();\n        const rootItem = await project.getRootItem();\n        const items = await rootItem.getItems();\n        const mainSequence = await project.getActiveSequence();\n        const seqEditor = await app.SequenceEditor.getEditor(mainSequence);\n        const insertionTime = await app.TickTime.createWithSeconds(3);\n        const onlyShiftInputTrack = true;\n        \n        var itemToInsert;\n        for (let i = 0; i < items.length; i++) {\n            if (items[i].name == \"Iceberg.MOV\") {\n                itemToInsert = items[i];\n                break;\n            }\n        }\n        \n        // Create & Execute the Insertion Action\n        project.lockedAccess(() => {\n            project.executeTransaction((compoundAction) => {\n                const actInsertProjItem = seqEditor.createInsertProjectItemAction(\n                    itemToInsert, \n                    insertionTime, \n                    0, \n                    0, \n                    onlyShiftInputTrack\n                );\n                compoundAction.addAction(actInsertProjItem);\n            });\n        });\n    } catch (err) {\n        console.error(err);\n    }\n}\n```\n\nCommunity members have confirmed that using `lockedAccess` and `executeTransaction` together resolves issues with action execution.\n\n### Key Points\n\n- An important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls were synchronous and blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread.\n\n- As of August 2025, only Premiere Pro BETA builds support UXP plugins. The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.\n\n- As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP.

The callback receives a CompoundAction instance where individual actions can be appended using `addAction()`.\n\n## Key Principle\n\nActions represent deferred operations rather than immediate changes. They're created by helper methods and executed later through transaction mechanisms, enabling undo/redo functionality.","durationMs":6732,"url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts"}}

The `createSetNameAction()` method exists but you cannot call `.execute()` directly on the returned Action object. Instead, you must use the `lockedAccess` and `executeTransaction` pattern with `compoundAction.addAction()`.\n\n## The Problem\n\nCalling `action.execute()` directly on an Action object fails with \"Script action failed to execute\" because actions in UXP are not meant to be executed directly.\n\n## The Solution\n\nActions must be executed through the `project.executeTransaction()` method wrapped in `project.lockedAccess()`. Here is the correct pattern:\n\n```javascript\nconst ppro = require(\"premierepro\");\n\nasync function renameClip(clip, newName) {\n    const project = await ppro.Project.getActiveProject();\n    \n    project.lockedAccess(() => {\n        project.executeTransaction((compoundAction) => {\n            const setNameAction = clip.createSetNameAction(newName);\n            compoundAction.addAction(setNameAction);\n        }, \"Rename Clip\");  // Optional undo string\n    });\n}\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n1. **Do not call `.execute()` on the action** - Actions are added to a CompoundAction instead\n2. **Wrap in `lockedAccess()`** - This ensures the project state does not change during execution\n3. **Use `executeTransaction()`** - This creates an undoable operation\n4. **Use `compoundAction.addAction()`** - This queues the action for execution\n5. **Create the action inside the transaction** - The action should be created within the callback, not before\n\n## Multiple Actions Example\n\nYou can batch multiple actions in a single transaction:\n\n```javascript\nproject.lockedAccess(() => {\n    project.executeTransaction((compoundAction) => {\n        clips.forEach(clip => {\n            const action = clip.createSetNameAction(`Take ${clip.index}`);\n            compoundAction.addAction(action);\n        });\n    }, \"Label All Clips\");\n});\n```\n\n## API Reference\n\n- `executeTransaction(callback: (compoundAction: CompoundAction) => void, undoString?: string): boolean`\n- `CompoundAction.addAction(action: Action): boolean`\n- `createSetNameAction(inName: string): Action`\n\nSources:\n- [Help with createInsertProjectItemAction - Adobe Community](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/help-with-the-new-uxp-createinsertprojectitemaction-method-quot-script-action-failed-to-execute-quot/m-p/15239302)\n- [How to use 'Action' in PremierePro UXP - Adobe Developer Forums](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/how-to-use-action-in-premierepro-uxp/8867)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [VideoClipTrackItem Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/videocliptrackitem/)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro types.d.ts](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":727,"cache_read_input_tokens":18110,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":727,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":815,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGYe7rb6XkMHZSVEASW2","type":"assistant","uuid":"6f18935b-cc2b-48bd-ad8b-c83a649235bd","timestamp":"2025-12-19T18:49:22.802Z"}
