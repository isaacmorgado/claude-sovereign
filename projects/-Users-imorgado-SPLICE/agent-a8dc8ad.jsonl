PPro 24.x ships with CEP11, so you'd need to enable debug mode with: `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11.plist PlayerDebugMode 1` (and then relaunch Finder on Mac).(no content)For Premiere Pro 2025, you need to make sure to enable debugging for CEP 12. Maybe the extension is only running on older Pr versions because debugging is only enabled for those older CEP versions.\n\n### 2. JSX File Issues\n\"Be aware that with HTML Panels a typo in the JSX makes the whole thing fail silently.\" One solution was to remove the manifest reference to an empty jsx file, which made the panel function.(no content)Another user found \"the log file mentioned a decode error.

New World Scripting in Newer Premiere Pro Versions\nVersion 14.0.2 and later defaults \"New World\" scripting to ON. #include directives don't work in New World. Instead, you can follow the usage in the PProPanel sample; upon panel launch, it evaluates (opens) all .jsx files used within the panel.\n\n### 4. Debugging Recommendations\nOne developer reported having \"set the PlayerDebugMode to 1 in Registry Editor\" but still got \"no proper error message, it just says EvalScript Error\" and was unable to debug it.(no content)The recommended solution is to \"Use Visual Studio Code (and the ExtendScript Debugger VSCode extension) to set breakpoints in PProPanel's ExtendScript, load the panel, and step through its code in the debugger.\"\n\n### 5.

CEP Version Mismatch (Most Common Issue)\nPPro 25.0 integrates CEP12, so you'd need to set PlayerDebugMode again (for CEP12 instead of CEP11), in order to load unsigned extensions.(no content)Setting the debug mode to the updated CEP version is the #1 reason that extensions stop working when a new CC version comes out.(no content)Users have reported that checking the logs made them notice there were logs for CSXS.12 and that they had to use that version instead of the one they had been using (CSXS.11).\n\n### 2. How to Set PlayerDebugMode on macOS\nFor macOS, in the terminal, type: `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11 PlayerDebugMode 1` (The plist is also located at /Users/`<username>`/Library/Preferences/com.adobe.CSXS.11.plist)\n\nFor **CEP 12** (Adobe 2025 apps), use:\n```bash\ndefaults write com.adobe.CSXS.12 PlayerDebugMode 1\n```\n\n### 3. macOS Plist Caching Issue\nStarting with Mac 10.9, Apple introduced a caching mechanism for plist files. Your modifications to plist files do not take effect until the cache gets updated (on a periodic basis, you cannot know exactly when the update will happen).\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Kill cfprefsd process. It will restart automatically. Then the update takes effect.\n- Restart your Mac, or log out the current user and re-log in.\n- Confirming (because it's bitten me before): You've restarted Finder, since enabling PlayerDebugMode, yes?\n\n### 4. Blank Panel Issue (Adobe 2025 Apps)\nIf PlayerDebugMode is set to 1, extension panel will show up, but it will be blank. This was tested with multiple extensions including Watchtower, Chronicler, Excalibur, also Storyblocks and Adobe built-in extensions.(no content)This is a huge issue across all Adobe 2025 apps at present including Photoshop, After Effects, Premiere Pro, Illustrator, and Audition. The name of the CEP panel displays, but no UI.\n\n### 5. Missing Manifest Element\nOne case was resolved when they figured out that there was a missing manifest element.\n\n### 6.

They're calling the existing ExtendScript engine through the same new \"plumbing\" being used by the more modern JavaScript engine, which will be used by UXP. The goal for this approach is that existing ExtendScript code should continue to work without modification under New World scripting.(no content)New World has been available since Premiere Pro 13.1.\n\n## The Fix\n\nInstead of using `#include` directives, you can follow the usage in the PProPanel sample (see /PProPanel/PProPanel.jsx); upon panel launch, it evaluates (opens) all .jsx files used within the panel.(no content)Some developers were using `#include` for importing json2.min.js since JSON is not available by default in ExtendScript.

If using an unsigned extension that loaded on 29.4, nothing more should be needed to load it on 29.5, so logs are the first diagnostic step.\n\n6. **Firewall Whitelisting**: You must whitelist each version of Adobe apps you use, including the Illustrator/Photoshop executable itself, CEPHtmlEngine.exe, and node.exe.\n\n7. **CEP Still Works (Confirmation)**: CEP is still working in Illustrator 2025 (29.3.1).

CEP Version Mismatch (Most Common Cause)\n\nThe error is \"100% consistent with PlayerDebugMode not being enabled for the version of CEP in use by PPro.\"\n\n| Premiere Pro Version | CEP Version | Command |\n|---------------------|-------------|---------|\n| PPro 2024 (24.x) | CEP 11 | `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11 PlayerDebugMode 1` |\n| PPro 2025 (25.x) | CEP 12 | `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.12 PlayerDebugMode 1` |\n\n**Critical step**: After running the command, you MUST restart Finder (reboot or Force Quit Finder).\n\nSource: [Adobe CEP Samples Issue #133](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/issues/133)\n\n---\n\n### 2. macOS Plist Caching Issue\n\nStarting with macOS 10.9, Apple introduced a caching mechanism for plist files. Modifications do not take effect until the cache updates.\n\n**Solutions:**\n- Kill `cfprefsd` process (it restarts automatically)\n- Log out and log back in\n- Reboot the Mac\n\nSource: [Creative-Scripts CEP Debug Guide](https://creative-scripts.com/setting-cep-debug-and-log-level/)\n\n---\n\n### 3. New World Scripting (PPro 14.0.2+)\n\nPremiere Pro 14.0.2 and later defaults \"New World\" scripting to ON. **#include directives do not work in New World.**\n\n**Fix**: Replace `#include` with `evalFile()` calls at runtime:\n```javascript\n// Instead of: #include \"json2.min.js\"\n// Use:\nvar scriptPath = $.fileName.split('/').slice(0, -1).join('/');\n$.evalFile(scriptPath + '/json2.min.js');\n```\n\nSource: [EvalScript error on Premiere Pro 14.0.2](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro/evalscript-error-on-premiere-pro-14-0-2/td-p/10946333)\n\n---\n\n### 4. JSX File Errors Fail Silently\n\nA typo or encoding error in JSX makes the whole thing fail silently with just \"EvalScript error.\"\n\n**Fixes:**\n- Save JSX files as UTF-8 (not ASCII)\n- Remove manifest references to empty JSX files\n- Use VS Code with ExtendScript Debugger extension to debug\n\nSource: [CEP hello world returns EvalScript error](https://community.adobe.com/t5/after-effects/cep-hello-world-returns-quot-evalscript-error-quot/m-p/9366081)\n\n---\n\n### 5. macOS 15 Sequoia + CEP 12 Issue (Fixed)\n\nThere was a known issue with unsigned CEP 12 extensions on macOS 15 Sequoia where PlayerDebugMode was ignored. This was marked as **Fixed** by Adobe.\n\nThe resolution involved a missing manifest element. Ensure your manifest.xml is complete.\n\nSource: [Cannot Load Unsigned CEP 12 Extensions - Fixed](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-bugs/cannot-load-unsigned-cep-12-extensions-in-premiere-pro-25-on-macos-15-playerdebugmode-ignored/idc-p/15333640)\n\n---\n\n### 6. Blank Panel Issue (Adobe 2025 Apps)\n\nSome users report the panel name displays but UI is blank. This affects multiple Adobe 2025 apps.\n\n**Potential fixes:**\n- Update to latest version of the Adobe app\n- Check logs at `~/Library/Logs/CSXS/`\n- Verify GPU/Metal compatibility (especially on VMs)\n\nSource: [CEP Panels won't load in Illustrator 29.5](https://community.adobe.com/t5/illustrator-discussions/cep-panels-won-t-load-in-illustrator-29-5/m-p/15300613)\n\n---\n\n## Complete Debug Mode Setup for macOS\n\n```bash\n# For Premiere Pro 2024 (CEP 11)\ndefaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11 PlayerDebugMode 1\n\n# For Premiere Pro 2025 (CEP 12)\ndefaults write com.adobe.CSXS.12 PlayerDebugMode 1\n\n# Kill plist cache daemon to force update\nkillall cfprefsd\n\n# Restart Finder\nkillall Finder\n```\n\n---\n\n## Extension Locations\n\n- **System-wide**: `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/`\n- **User-specific**: `~/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/`\n\n---\n\n## Important: CEP Deprecation Notice\n\nAs of Premiere Pro 25.6, CEP extensions have been superseded by UXP Extensibility. Adobe plans to support both CEP and UXP for a calendar year, after which CEP support will be removed.\n\nSource: [PProPanel ReadMe](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Samples/blob/master/PProPanel/ReadMe.md)\n\n---\n\n## Debugging Recommendations\n\n1. Use VS Code with [ExtendScript Debugger extension](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/blob/master/Client-side%20Debugging/readme.md)\n2. Check CSXS logs at `~/Library/Logs/CSXS/`\n3. Use Premiere Pro's Debug Console (`Cmd+F12`) to verify New World scripting status\n4.
