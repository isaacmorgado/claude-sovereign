Each plan provides varying levels of access, features, and usage rights.\n\n- The Basic Plan is ideal for beginners and casual users who wish to explore AI-generated music without any financial commitment. However, creations under this plan cannot be used for commercial purposes.\n- The Pro Plan suits hobbyists and enthusiasts seeking more flexibility and the ability to monetize their creations.\n- For enterprises or users with specific requirements, Suno AI provides customizable plans. These plans offer tailored credit amounts, commercial terms, and additional features.\n\n### Third-Party API Pricing\nSince there's no official API, developers rely on third-party services:\n\n- The official Suno API is priced at approximately $0.04 per creation API call, with additional charges for continuation calls.\n- CometAPI offers Music Generation at $0.144 per create API call.\n- Some services offer usage-based pricing (e.g., $0.144 per generation call), which is noted as far lower than official price.\n\n### Third-Party API Options\nGoAPI provides an unofficial, simple, cost-effective Suno API for applications. As an independent project not related to Suno, their API provides text-to-music generation capabilities.(no content)With the Pay-per-use (PPU) option, you just top up credits at the dashboard and use the API right away. The benefit is that you don't need to have your own Suno accounts to use the Suno API, as you will be using their account pools instead.\n\n### Available Models via Third-Party APIs\nThird-party providers offer APIs for the latest AI music models, including Suno V5, V4.5 Plus, V4.5 All, V4.5, and V4, offering high-quality music generation. They support creation of both vocal and instrumental tracks, music extension, and multi-format downloads.(no content)While official Suno API access remains limited, middleware solutions offer reliable and cost-effective access to Suno's music generation capabilities.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"1f2289c1-6c9f-4ffb-b525-ba188c09197c","timestamp":"2025-12-26T08:30:44.024Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Suno AI official API 2025 pricing developer access","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_018y7jfUurFyXQWscLE4pnaR","content":[{"title":"2025 Ultimate Guide to Suno API Pricing: Comparing 10+ Providers for Maximum Value – LaoZhang-AI","url":"https://blog.laozhang.ai/api-services/suno-api-pricing-comparison/"},{"title":"Most Stable and Pricing Affordable AI Music API","url":"https://sunoapi.org/"},{"title":"How Much Does Suno AI Cost in 2025?​ - CometAPI - All AI Models in One API","url":"https://www.cometapi.com/how-much-does-suno-ai-cost/"},{"title":"Suno API Documentation - Suno API","url":"https://docs.sunoapi.org/"},{"title":"Suno AI: Complete Guide - How to Use, Pricing, Features & Music Generation Tips — AI/ML API Blog 🔥","url":"https://aimlapi.com/blog/suno-ai-complete-guide"},{"title":"GitHub - Goapiai/Suno-API: Connect your generative AI apps with Suno API in seconds!","url":"https://github.com/Goapiai/Suno-API"},{"title":"Suno API: A Deep Dive into the New Frontier of AI Music","url":"https://skywork.ai/skypage/en/suno-api-ai-music/1977568238882582528"},{"title":"Ultimate Guide to Suno API in 2025: 7 Ways to Build AI Music Applications – LaoZhang-AI","url":"https://blog.laozhang.ai/ai-tools/ultimate-guide-suno-api-2025/"},{"title":"GoAPI - Suno API","url":"https://goapi.ai/suno-api"},{"title":"Pricing | AI Music API","url":"https://aimusicapi.ai/en/pricing"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about Suno AI API pricing and developer access in 2025:\n\n## Key Finding: No Official Public API\n\nAs of late 2025, Suno has not released an official, public API.(no content)The term \"Suno API\" almost exclusively refers to a collection of third-party services and open-source projects, not an official product.\n\n## Pricing Information\n\n### Official Suno Pricing (Consumer Platform)\nSuno AI offers a tiered pricing model to cater to different user requirements.

Generally, Suno is considered ultimately responsible for the output itself, though users help guide it. In that sense, Suno acts as the owner, but they give users the rights often associated with ownership if songs were made while subscribed.\n\n## Commercial Use Rights by Plan\n\n### Free Plan\nIf you are using the free plan, Suno retains ownership of the songs you generate, but you are allowed to use those songs for non-commercial purposes, subject to compliance with Suno's Terms of Service.(no content)Songs made on the free plan are only available for non-commercial use and cannot be monetized. Starting a subscription after making a song will not give you a retroactive license for that song.\n\n### Pro or Premier Plan (Paid Subscriptions)\nIf you were subscribed with a Pro or Premier plan when the song was created, you are granted commercial use rights for the song. You also retain the commercial use rights after ending your subscription. However, this does not indicate ownership, as Suno can't guarantee that what you input was yours, and they can't guarantee that the output won't be similar to other outputs they generate.\n\n## Recent Changes (December 2025)\n\nAccording to recent reports, last month Suno's policy stated \"If you make songs while subscribed to the Pro or Premier plan, you own the songs.\" However, the same webpage has since modified its title and embraced a noticeably different take on output ownership.(no content)The retooled resource now reads: \"You may be granted commercial use rights, which allow you to reproduce (copy) the song(s) to sell, distribute, etc. Even with granted commercial use rights, you generally are not considered the owner of the songs, since the output was generated by Suno.\"\n\n## Copyright Considerations\n\nEven with granted commercial use rights, you generally are not considered the owner of the songs since the output was generated by Suno. Additionally, the material may not be eligible for copyright. In the US, copyright laws protect material with significant human contribution.(no content)According to US copyright law, if you wrote the lyrics yourself, you are considered the copyright owner from the moment you wrote them - this applies specifically to the lyrics portion, not the AI-generated musical output.\n\n## Retroactive Rights\n\nSubscribing to a Pro or Premier plan does not give you retroactive commercial use licensing for songs made with a free plan by default. Songs made with Suno's free plan can only be used for non-commercial purposes. Suno may offer retroactive rights in certain cases, but this is not guaranteed and applies only to specific songs.(no content)You can cancel your monthly plan at any time, and you retain the rights to the songs you made while subscribed, even after the subscription is canceled.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4bca3b25-1536-4eb2-afbd-ec968e20cfad","timestamp":"2025-12-26T08:30:46.986Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Suno AI commercial license music ownership terms of service 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01J9LcNEx4zY6934Va93gKqP","content":[{"title":"Terms of Service - Suno","url":"https://suno.com/terms-of-service"},{"title":"Does Suno own the music I make?","url":"https://help.suno.com/en/articles/2416769"},{"title":"Suno Previews 2026 Changes Under Warner Music Deal","url":"https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/12/22/suno-warner-music-deal-changes/"},{"title":"Rights & Ownership - Knowledge Base - Suno","url":"https://help.suno.com/en/categories/550145"},{"title":"Do I own the copyrights to songs I made?","url":"https://help.suno.com/en/articles/2746945"},{"title":"Terms of Service - Suno AI","url":"https://suno.com/terms"},{"title":"AI Music Making","url":"https://answers.justia.com/question/2024/07/20/ai-music-making-1023057"},{"title":"Suno AI: General Commercial Terms for Suno AI","url":"https://sunnoai.com/general-commercial-terms/"},{"title":"Do You Own Your Suno Music? | Moosic Entertainment","url":"https://moosicentertainment.com/2024/11/20/do-you-own-your-suno-music/"},{"title":"If I subscribe, do I get rights for the songs I made before subscribing?","url":"https://help.suno.com/en/articles/2425729"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about Suno AI's commercial license, music ownership, and terms of service as of late 2025:\n\n## Ownership Structure\n\nThe ownership situation is somewhat complicated.

It supports creation of both vocal and instrumental tracks, music extension, and multi-format downloads.\n\n### Authentication\n\nTo access the Suno AI API, you need an API key, which is provided once you register on the Suno platform. The API key serves as a unique identifier, allowing you to authenticate your API requests and track your usage.(no content)All requests to the external API must be authenticated using a SUNO Application TOKEN. This token serves as the primary authentication credential for the entire system.\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe application loads configuration from a .env file in the project root directory. This file is not included in the repository for security reasons and must be created manually.(no content)The authentication system is implemented through a dependency injection pattern using the get_token() function in the deps.py module.

It supports creation of both vocal and instrumental tracks, music extension, and multi-format downloads.\n\n### Authentication\n\nTo access the Suno AI API, you need an API key, which is provided once you register on the Suno platform. The API key serves as a unique identifier, allowing you to authenticate your API requests and track your usage.(no content)All requests to the external API must be authenticated using a SUNO Application TOKEN. This token serves as the primary authentication credential for the entire system.\n\n### Configuration\n\nThe application loads configuration from a .env file in the project root directory. This file is not included in the repository for security reasons and must be created manually.(no content)The authentication system is implemented through a dependency injection pattern using the get_token() function in the deps.py module.

As an independent project not related to Suno, their API offers text-to-music generation capabilities.\n\n### Pricing Options\n\nGoAPI offers two main pricing models:\n\n1. **Pay-Per-Use (PPU) Option:**\n   - This is the PPU (pay-per-use) option. Just sign up, top up, and start integrating.\n   - Pay-per-use allows you to top up credits at GoAPI's dashboard and use the API right away. The benefit is that you don't need to have your own Suno accounts to use the Suno API, as you will be using their account pools instead.\n   - GoAPI's Suno-API costs $0.02 per create API call (50% cheaper than official pricing).\n\n2. **BYOA (Bring-Your-Own-Account) Option:**\n   - GoAPI can host your Suno accounts with this BYOA option. You won't be waiting in line for others' tasks to finish before your task starts, and the concurrency limit will be as per your account(s).\n   - With BYOA, you will be using your own Suno account(s)' resources. You will be required to buy GoAPI Suno API seat(s), bind your Suno Account(s) to the seat(s), and you are ready to go.\n\n### Features\n\n- V3 model supported\n- Lyrics generations available\n- Supports high concurrency\n\n### Async/Webhook Information\n\nThe search results indicate that webhook support is common among Suno API providers. Full webhook support is available to receive real-time notifications when music generation is complete, eliminating the need for polling.(no content)Typical generation times range from 30-90 seconds depending on song length and complexity, and you can use webhooks to get notified when generation completes.\n\n### Comparison Context\n\nThe official Suno API is priced at approximately $0.04 per creation API call, so GoAPI's pricing at $0.02 per call represents about 50% savings compared to official pricing.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"b675ad1e-ae07-462a-9f2a-acfcc91d26af","timestamp":"2025-12-26T08:31:27.162Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"GoAPI Suno API pricing per song generation webhook async 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01P2oKqCuhXrZsgLX3z25Atb","content":[{"title":"GoAPI - Suno API","url":"https://goapi.ai/suno-api"},{"title":"Most Stable and Pricing Affordable AI Music API","url":"https://sunoapi.org/"},{"title":"Suno API Documentation - Suno API","url":"https://docs.sunoapi.org/"},{"title":"GitHub - Goapiai/Suno-API: Connect your generative AI apps with Suno API in seconds!","url":"https://github.com/Goapiai/Suno-API"},{"title":"2025 Ultimate Guide to Suno API Pricing: Comparing 10+ Providers for Maximum Value – LaoZhang-AI","url":"https://blog.laozhang.ai/api-services/suno-api-pricing-comparison/"},{"title":"Lyrica API - Official Suno AI Music Generation API | Create Songs Programmatically","url":"https://sunoapi.info/"},{"title":"Suno API - AI Music Generation API | Pricing & Quick Start","url":"https://apiframe.ai/suno-api-for-ai-music-generation"},{"title":"Suno V5 API — Pricing, Docs & API Key | PiAPI","url":"https://piapi.ai/suno-v5"},{"title":"GitHub - gcui-art/suno-api: Use API to call the music generation AI of suno.ai, and easily integrate it into agents like GPTs.","url":"https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api"},{"title":"Suno/Udio AI Music API Pricing / Plans | AI Music API","url":"https://aimusicapi.org/pricing"}]},"Here's what I found about GoAPI Suno API pricing and features for 2025:\n\n## GoAPI Suno API Overview\n\nGoAPI provides an unofficial, simple, cost-effective Suno API for applications.

Users can upload audio or video clips ranging from 6 to 60 seconds in length.\n\n### How Audio Input Works\nYou can upload short audio clips or hum a melody, and the AI will adapt it to your chosen music style or even extend it into a complete song.(no content)After uploading, users can extend the uploaded clip, set a timestamp to start from, choose a genre, and include their own lyrics.\n\n### Style Matching and Creative Controls\nThe Song Editor now includes three new \"creative sliders,\" which allow users to determine the \"weirdness\" level of the track, how structured it is, and how \"reference-driven\" it is.(no content)Advanced Options include Weirdness, Style Influence, and Audio Influence.

Adjust Style Influence to change how strong the genre sounds.\n\n### Song Editor Upgrades\nSuno unveiled an upgraded version of its Song Editor tool, which enables users to upload work-in-progress tracks that can then be rearranged or remixed within Suno. The Song Editor can also alter lyrics, and the maximum length of an uploaded track has been increased to eight minutes.(no content)Users can complete the track within the Song Editor, or separate it into as many as 12 stems (vocals, drums, bass, etc.)\n\n### Copyright Protections\nCopyrighted works will be blocked from audio upload, and all inputs with vocals will remain private and unsearchable.\n\n### Limitations\nExtend isn't the best word for this feature.

API Access and Pricing\n\n**Official API Status: NOT AVAILABLE**\n\nSuno AI does **not** have an official public API as of December 2025. The company has indicated plans for developer tools and API access, but nothing has been publicly released yet.\n\n**Third-Party API Options:**\n\n| Provider | Cost per Generation | Notes |\n|----------|---------------------|-------|\n| [GoAPI](https://goapi.ai/suno-api) | $0.02/create, $0.04/continue | Pay-per-use, no Suno account needed |\n| [SunoAPI.org](https://sunoapi.org/) | ~$0.04/create | Full webhook support, V5 model access |\n| [CometAPI](https://www.cometapi.com/how-much-does-suno-ai-cost/) | $0.144/create | Aggregator service |\n| [gcui-art/suno-api](https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api) (Self-hosted) | Free + Suno subscription | Requires own Suno account + 2Captcha for CAPTCHA solving |\n\n**GoAPI Subscription Plans:**\n- Hobbyist: $0/month (2 concurrent generations)\n- Developer: $15/month (10 concurrent generations)\n- Premium: $60/month (50 concurrent generations)\n\n---\n\n### 2. Capabilities\n\n**Song Duration by Model:**\n\n| Model | Max Duration | Notes |\n|-------|--------------|-------|\n| V2 | 1 min 20 sec | Oldest model |\n| V3.5/V4 | 4 minutes | Better quality |\n| V4.5/V5 | **8 minutes** | Latest, paid-only |\n\n**Audio Input Features (Pro/Premier only):**\n- Upload audio clips 6-60 seconds\n- Hum melodies for AI to extend\n- Style matching with \"creative sliders\" (Weirdness, Style Influence, Audio Influence)\n- Upload tracks up to 8 minutes for Song Editor remixing\n- Stem separation (up to 12 stems: vocals, drums, bass, etc.)\n- **Limitation:** Cannot precisely match timbre of existing tracks\n\n**Output Formats:**\n- Audio download (MP3)\n- Video download (MP4 with visualizations)\n- WAV conversion available via API\n- Stem extraction available\n\n**Generation Time:**\n- Streaming URL: 30-40 seconds\n- Downloadable file: 2-3 minutes\n\n---\n\n### 3. Copyright and Licensing\n\n**Critical: Recent December 2025 Policy Change**\n\nAccording to [Digital Music News](https://www.digitalmusicnews.com/2025/12/22/suno-warner-music-deal-changes/), Suno recently modified its ownership stance after the Warner Music deal:\n\n| Plan | Commercial Use | Ownership |\n|------|----------------|-----------|\n| Free | **No** - Non-commercial only | Suno owns |\n| Pro/Premier | **Yes** - Commercial rights granted | **Suno owns** (you get license only) |\n\n**Key Points from [Suno Help Center](https://help.suno.com/en/articles/2416769):**\n- You do NOT own the songs - Suno does\n- Paid plans grant commercial **use rights**, not ownership\n- AI-generated output may not be eligible for US copyright protection\n- If you wrote the lyrics yourself, you own the lyrics copyright\n- Rights are NOT retroactive (upgrading doesn't give rights to free-tier songs)\n- Rights retained after cancellation for songs made while subscribed\n\n**Risk Assessment:**\n- Generated music may be similar to other users' outputs\n- No guarantee of uniqueness\n- Copyright protection uncertain under US law\n\n---\n\n### 4. Technical Integration\n\n**Third-Party API Integration (via [SunoAPI.org Docs](https://docs.sunoapi.org/)):**\n\n**Base URL:** `https://api.sunoapi.org`\n\n**Authentication:**\n```\nAuthorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY\n```\n\n**Key Endpoints:**\n| Endpoint | Purpose |\n|----------|---------|\n| Generate Music | Text-to-music with style/genre |\n| Extend Music | Continue existing tracks |\n| Upload & Cover | Transform audio to new styles |\n| Add Vocals | Generate vocals for instrumentals |\n| Add Instrumental | Create accompaniment |\n| Generate Lyrics | AI lyrics creation |\n| Get Timestamped Lyrics | Lyrics with sync markers |\n| Vocal Separation | Extract stems |\n| Convert to WAV | High-quality export |\n| Create Music Video | MP4 with visualizations |\n\n**Webhook Support:**\n- Full webhook/callback support on all major endpoints\n- Real-time notifications on completion\n- No polling required\n\n**Self-Hosted Option ([gcui-art/suno-api](https://github.com/gcui-art/suno-api)):**\n- LGPL-3.0 license (2.4k stars, 609 forks)\n- Requires: Suno account + 2Captcha subscription (for CAPTCHA solving)\n- Endpoints: `/api/generate`, `/api/custom_generate`, `/api/extend_audio`, `/api/generate_lyrics`\n- OpenAI-compatible format (`/v1/chat/completions`)\n- One-click Vercel/Docker deployment\n\n---\n\n### Summary Recommendation for SPLICE Integration\n\n**Risks of Integration:**\n1. **No Official API** - All solutions are unofficial wrappers\n2. **Terms of Service Violations** - Self-hosted solutions may violate Suno ToS\n3. **Ownership Uncertainty** - Commercial use granted, but Suno owns output\n4. **Account Bans** - Using unofficial APIs risks account termination\n5. **CAPTCHA Requirements** - Self-hosted needs paid CAPTCHA solving service\n\n**If Proceeding:**\n- Use third-party provider (GoAPI or SunoAPI.org) to avoid account management\n- Cost estimate: $0.02-$0.04 per song generation\n- Implement webhook callbacks for async generation\n- Clearly disclose to users that generated music has commercial use rights but not ownership\n- Consider adding attribution requirements in your ToS\n\n**Alternative Consideration:**\nMonitor [suno.com](https://suno.com) for official API announcements, as enterprise/developer access appears to be on their roadmap for 2025-2026."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2140,"cache_read_input_tokens":31777,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2140,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWUzGcxGMpX63RjX86sjd","type":"assistant","uuid":"c852351a-b63e-473e-9a2e-863eec670009","timestamp":"2025-12-26T08:33:01.187Z"}
