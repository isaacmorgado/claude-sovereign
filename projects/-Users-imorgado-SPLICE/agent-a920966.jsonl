This provides privacy, offline access, and potentially lower costs, but requires more setup and a powerful computer.\n\n### Configuration Steps\nOpen the Roo Code sidebar (icon), click the settings gear icon, select \"ollama\" as the API Provider, and enter the model tag or saved name (e.g., your_model_name).(no content)Optionally, configure the base URL if you're running Ollama on a different machine. The default is http://localhost:11434.\n\n### Model Switching Strategies\n\n**Configuration Profiles:**\nRoo Code allows developers to create custom configuration profiles that define how it connects to different AI models, including locally hosted LLMs. From Settings → Providers, you can add profiles through OpenRouter or other supported providers, then choose a local model running via Ollama or LM Studio. Each configuration profile can store its own parameters, including temperature, reasoning depth, and token limits. This lets you switch between lightweight cloud models and fully local runtimes for on-device inference.\n\n**Mode-Based Model Assignment:**\nConfigure specialized profiles for different model providers, switching between OpenAI, Anthropic, or local models based on the task. The ability to pair specific models and configurations with specific interaction modes gives you control. You could have o3 mini handling your architect planning while Claude Sonnet 4 executes the actual code, each with their own optimized settings.\n\n### Context Window Management\nRoo Code automatically defers to the Modelfile's num_ctx setting by default. When you use a model with Ollama, Roo Code reads the model's configured context window and uses it automatically. You don't need to configure context size in Roo Code settings - it respects what's defined in your Ollama model.\n\n### Optimization Tips\nDuring testing, portions of original code files may be missing on larger refactorings. Bumping the num_predict parameter up to 12000 can fix this problem. Ollama's default configuration seems to limit the length of the result message, which caused code files to be truncated.(no content)Adjust context window based on your available memory: 16384 for ~8GB VRAM, 32768 for ~16GB VRAM, 65536 for ~24GB+ VRAM.\n\n### Supported Providers\nRoo Code currently supports two main local model providers: Ollama (a popular open-source tool for running large language models locally that supports a wide range of models) and LM Studio (a user-friendly desktop application that simplifies the process of downloading, configuring, and running local models, and provides a local server that emulates the OpenAI API).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"84385a02-6f96-4342-b039-38e107a50ada","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:43:45.572Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Roo Code model switching strategies Ollama local models","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01RMhS2EhxNsXYeETqMQPC2c","content":[{"title":"Using Ollama With Roo Code | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/providers/ollama"},{"title":"Using Local Models | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/advanced-usage/local-models"},{"title":"GitHub - olilanz/RooCode-Local-Evaluation: Evaluation of Roo Code and locally hosted LLMs","url":"https://github.com/olilanz/RooCode-Local-Evaluation"},{"title":"Roo Code - Ollama","url":"https://docs.ollama.com/integrations/roo-code"},{"title":"Implement Lazy Loading for Local Model Providers (Ollama, LM Studio) · Issue #4695 · RooCodeInc/Roo-Code","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/4695"},{"title":"Vibe Coding ‘Locally’ with Cline/Roo and Ollama — Better Experience!","url":"https://mychen76.medium.com/vibe-coding-locally-with-cline-roo-and-ollama-better-experience-a8846c829d66"},{"title":"Roo Code: A Guide With 7 Practical Examples | DataCamp","url":"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/roo-code"},{"title":"Local AI Agents: Goose, Observer AI, AnythingLLM in 2026","url":"https://research.aimultiple.com/local-ai-agent/"},{"title":"Frequently Asked Questions | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/faq"},{"title":"AI: Introduction to Ollama for local LLM launch | by Arseny Zinchenko (setevoy) | ITNEXT","url":"https://itnext.io/ai-introduction-to-ollama-for-local-llm-launch-a95e5200c3e7"}]},"Based on the search results, here's information about Roo Code model switching strategies with Ollama local models:\n\n## Roo Code with Ollama Local Models\n\n### Basic Setup\nRoo Code supports running models locally using Ollama.

Roo Code is an open-source VS Code extension that puts an entire AI development team right in your code editor for autonomous coding.\n\n### Pricing Models\n- Roo Code follows a flexible pricing approach that puts you in control of costs. The extension itself is completely free and open-source. You never pay subscription fees to use Roo Code.\n- For Claude Code, team plans with premium seats cost $150 per person monthly.\n- Some users report using Claude Max at $100/month without hitting rate limits, which works well for heavy usage.\n\n### Strengths\n\n**Claude Code:**\n- Claude Code is known for making surgical, necessary corrections without adding a bunch of fluff. This saves time and reduces the risk of introducing new bugs.\n- Because it's a CLI tool, it's scriptable. This is a huge deal for enterprise workflows. You can integrate Claude Code into your GitHub Actions to automatically refactor code on a pull request or write documentation for new functions.\n- Claude Code wins on versatility. You can use it as a CLI command, integrate it into shell scripts, add it to automation workflows, and run it in diverse environments.\n- Claude Code's 77.2% success rate on SWE-bench Verified represents industry-leading performance.\n\n**Roo Code:**\n- When one AI model is acting \"senile\" (as one Redditor put it), you can swap it out for another one in seconds. This is a lifesaver when you're hitting a wall.\n- Roo offers more control and a better coding experience overall.\n- Roo Code is optimized specifically for VSCode, making it the clear winner if you're a VSCode devotee who wants everything in one place. The integration feels native and seamless within that environment.\n- Roo Code offers customizable modes, such as Code Mode for routine coding tasks, Architect Mode for designing systems, Ask Mode for posing questions, Debug Mode for resolving issues, and user-defined Custom Modes tailored for specific tasks.\n\n### Drawbacks\n\n**Roo Code:**\n- It can be a token-guzzler, especially on big projects. Since you're paying for the API calls to whatever model you're using, a big refactoring task can get pricey.\n\n**Claude Code:**\n- Claude Code needs some set-up—especially if you're on Windows since you'll have to use WSL. Once you get past the learning curve, it shines.\n\n### User Recommendations\n- If you want something that tackles everything in one go, Claude Code is the route to take, but if you prefer customization, Roo might be your best bet.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0c0aa687-94b8-431a-9c0a-a4d11f5b1f69","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:43:45.782Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Roo Code vs Claude Code comparison Reddit 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01WpNcsuedjVT7K1NbgxcRxg","content":[{"title":"Roo vs. Claude Code: Best AI for Large, Complex Codebases","url":"https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases"},{"title":"SOTA Project Management tools · RooCodeInc/Roo-Code · Discussion #6413","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/6413"},{"title":"Claude Code vs Roo Code: Features, Pricing and User Reviews 2025","url":"https://toolquestor.com/vs/claude-code-vs-roo-code"},{"title":"AI Code Gen Tools: Roo Code vs Claude Code vs Cursor","url":"https://www.linkedin.com/posts/affaanmustafa_ai-cs-0em-activity-7340179751363387393-rlYn"},{"title":"Compare Claude Code vs. Roo Code in 2026","url":"https://slashdot.org/software/comparison/Claude-Code-vs-Roo-Code/"},{"title":"The Only AI Coding Stack That Isn’t Complete Garbage: VSCode, Roocode, Augment, and Why Claude is the Only AI for “Vibe Coding” as of May, 2025 | by Aeon Flex, Elriel Assoc. 2133 [NEON MAXIMA] | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@neonmaxima/the-only-ai-coding-stack-that-isnt-complete-garbage-vscode-rocode-augment-and-why-claude-is-eb4352bd0e3d"},{"title":"Should I stick with Roo or make the switch to Claude Code? - Yo Motherboard","url":"https://yomotherboard.com/question/should-i-stick-with-roo-or-make-the-switch-to-claude-code/"},{"title":"Roo Code vs Claude Code Comparison in 2025 - Aitoolnet","url":"https://www.aitoolnet.com/compare/roo-code-vs-claude-code"},{"title":"Using Claude 3.5 vs. Claude 3.7 in Roo Code or Cline","url":"https://www.requesty.ai/blog/using-claude-3-5-vs-claude-3-7-in-roo-code-or-cline"},{"title":"Claude Code versus Roo Code Which AI Coding Tool Is Right for You? | berryhill.dev","url":"https://berryhill.dev/posts/claude-code-versus-roo-code-which-ai-coding-tool-is-right-for-you"}]},"Based on my search, here's what I found about **Roo Code vs Claude Code comparison** based on discussions and reviews from 2025:\n\n## Key Differences\n\n### Platform & Interface\n- Claude Code is an AI-powered coding assistant that lives in your terminal, helping developers write and debug code faster through natural language.

It goes beyond simple autocompletion by reading and writing across multiple files, executing commands, and adapting to your workflow—like having a whole dev team right inside your editor.(no content)Roo Code is an open-source VSCode extension which started as a Fork of Cline – another extension with similar capabilities. It's a coding agent that can make changes directly in the editor you are working on, run terminal commands and integrate with different tools using MCP servers.\n\n## Key Features\n\nRoo Code deploys agentic AI assistants to plan, write, and fix code across multiple files in the editor. It provides switchable modes like Code, Architect, and Debug for targeted development scenarios. It analyzes the entire codebase using diff-based edits to enable seamless multi-file refactors.(no content)Roo Code is open-source and fully customizable, letting you integrate any AI model you choose (e.g, OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs, etc.). It's built for multi-file edits, so it can read, refactor, and update multiple files at once for holistic code changes. Its agentic abilities go beyond a typical AI autocomplete, enabling it to run tests, open a browser, and handle deeper tasks. And you're always in control: Roo Code is permission-based, meaning you can control and approve any file changes or command executions.\n\n## Best Use Cases\n\n### 1. Complex Multi-File Projects\nRoo Code caters to power users working on large, complex projects that require careful context management and precise control over agent behavior.\n\n### 2. Full-Stack Application Development\nWhen asked to build an application for selling music gear, Roo Code offered a functioning application built from vanilla CSS/JavaScript/HTML on the front end and Node/Express/SQLite on the back end.\n\n### 3. Enterprise and Big-Code Work\nBig-code wranglers swear by Claude Desktop and/or Roocode, where the price of admission is smaller than the therapy bill.\n\n### 4. Developers Who Want Control\nDevelopers who prefer explicit control over AI operations and want to approve actions before they happen will find Roo Code's permission-based workflow reassuring, especially when working with sensitive codebases.\n\n### 5. Customizable Workflows\nConfiguration profiles allow you to assign different AI models and settings to specific modes, like using o3 for architecture planning and Claude Sonnet 4 for code execution. Boomerang tasks coordinate complex workflows that move between different modes and personas automatically.\n\n## Strengths\n\nUsers report benefits in productivity for refactoring and prototyping, with recent GitHub commits showing enhancements in context handling for large projects.(no content)\"I've used all the IDEs and all the assistants - Roo Code is hands down the best of them. It's also one of the few that lets you bring your own API keys - no subscriptions required, just pay as you need/go!\"(no content)Recent updates have significantly improved Roo Code's performance, particularly in diff editing speed, which is now up to 10 times faster than previous versions. The extension continues to evolve with new features like customizable network timeouts and Quick Actions for faster code optimization.\n\n## Limitations\n\nDrawbacks include occasional prompt sensitivity leading to iterative fixes and higher token usage in complex scenarios.(no content)The token consumption and single session limitation are notable constraints to consider.(no content)For small-to-medium projects or quick prototyping, Roo Code's setup requirements may be too much. If you're just getting started with AI-powered coding, beginning with Cline for its simpler approach, or even Cursor may be recommended.\n\n## Cost\n\nRoo Code is completely free and open-source. You'll only pay for the AI model usage if you use a paid API (like OpenAI).\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c92015c4-cfb8-4a33-8139-9e09f8b0a0c5","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:43:51.803Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Roo Code AI coding assistant review 2025 best use cases","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01QVWn62FXaHVijhTvQJ6odo","content":[{"title":"Roo Code review: Autonomous AI-powered development in the IDE | InfoWorld","url":"https://www.infoworld.com/article/4019646/roo-code-review-a-first-look-at-autonomous-ai-powered-development-in-the-ide.html"},{"title":"Roo Code – The AI dev team that gets things done","url":"https://roocode.com/"},{"title":"Roo Code review: A perspective on AI-powered coding - Qubika","url":"https://qubika.com/blog/roo-code/"},{"title":"Roo Code: A Guide With 7 Practical Examples | DataCamp","url":"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/roo-code"},{"title":"GitHub - RooCodeInc/Roo-Code: Roo Code gives you a whole dev team of AI agents in your code editor.","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code"},{"title":"How I Effectively Use Roo Code for AI-Assisted Development","url":"https://spin.atomicobject.com/roo-code-ai-assisted-development/"},{"title":"Roo Code - Is This The Best AI Coding Tool in 2025? 🏆","url":"https://www.bestaitools.com/tool/roo-code/"},{"title":"Roo Code Reviews - 2025","url":"https://slashdot.org/software/p/Roo-Code/"},{"title":"Roo Code vs GitHub Copilot: The Ultimate AI Coding Assistant Comparison in 2025 - Blog - Best Free AI Tools 2025","url":"https://bestfreeai.net/blog/roo-code-vs-github-copilot/"},{"title":"2025s Best AI Coding Tools: Real Cost, Geeky Value & Honest Comparison - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/stevengonsalvez/2025s-best-ai-coding-tools-real-cost-geeky-value-honest-comparison-4d63"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive overview of Roo Code AI coding assistant reviews and best use cases for 2025:\n\n## What is Roo Code?\n\nRoo Code is an open-source, AI-powered coding assistant that runs in VS Code.

This allows developers to describe their desired outcomes and tasks in a conversational manner, making the interaction with the AI intuitive and accessible.(no content)Roo Code possesses the capability to directly access and manipulate files within the user's project workspace. This includes generating new code, modifying existing files, and performing other file-related operations as directed by the user's natural language instructions. When changes are made to files, Roo Code conveniently displays diffs, allowing developers to easily review the proposed modifications before accepting them.\n\n### Modes and Customization\nThe extension's customizable Modes (Architect, Code, etc) and the pre-defined Cloud Agent Types (Planner, Coder, etc) keep the models on track and focused on the task at hand, without stepping outside of their boundaries.(no content)Roo's Modes keep models focused on a given task and limit their access to tools which are relevant to their role, keeping the context window clearer and avoiding surprises. Modes are even smart enough to ask to switch to another when stepping outside their responsibilities.(no content)Roo-Code allows for the creation of customizable personalities and capabilities through its Custom Modes feature, enabling it to adapt to a wide range of development roles and tasks.\n\n### Model Flexibility\nIt works great with 10s of models, from frontier to open weight. Choose from the curated selection we offer at-cost or bring your own key.(no content)It's also one of the few that lets you bring your own API keys - no subscriptions required, just pay as you need/go!\n\n### Semantic Search\nThe configuration flexibility opens up several advantages: Semantic search (find code by meaning rather than exact keywords), cross-project discovery (search across all files, not just what's currently open), pattern recognition (locate similar implementations and code patterns throughout your project), and privacy control (keep everything local with Ollama and Docker Qdrant, or use cloud providers for convenience).\n\n## Main Advantages\n\nOne of the most significant advantages is the potential for increased efficiency. By automating repetitive coding tasks, Roo-Code frees up valuable developer time that can be better spent on more complex problem-solving and innovation.(no content)Roo Code integrates directly into your existing VSCode environment, allowing you to use all your familiar tools and settings.(no content)The ability to use different modes depending on the context, make direct changes on the files and execute terminal commands offer significant advantages for productivity.(no content)Roo Code VS Code Extension works locally in your VS Code IDE and gives you full control over your coding experience. It's great for deep or highly iterative solo development work. It's highly customizable and fits into your existing workflow.(no content)The Roo Code Extension is open source so you can see for yourself exactly what it's doing and we don't use your data for training. Plus they're fully SOC2 Type 2 compliant and follow industry-standard security practices.\n\n### Additional Features for IT Pros\nRoo Code serves system administrators more effectively, as it provides a mode more suitable for natural language use in a CLI. Additionally, Roo Code's support of VS Code's Code Actions feature makes it perfect for understanding and modifying a colleague's scripts.(no content)Another extra Roo Code feature is the Support Prompts: Enhance Prompt, Explain Code, Fix Issues, and Add to Context.

Roo Code uses large language models (LLMs) that have a limited \"context window.\"(no content)This is the maximum amount of text (measured in tokens) that the model can process at once. If the context is too large, the model may not be able to understand your request or generate accurate responses.\n\n## Key Best Practices\n\n### 1. Be Specific with References\nWhen referring to files or code, use specific file paths and function names. Avoid vague references like \"the main file.\"\n\n### 2. Use Context Mentions Effectively\nUse @/path/to/file.ts to include specific files. Use @problems to include current errors and warnings.\n\n### 3. Manage Conversation History\nRoo Code automatically truncates older messages in the conversation history to stay within the context window. Be mindful of this, and re-include important context if needed.\n\n### 4. Enable Prompt Caching\nSome API providers like Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter and Requesty support \"prompt caching\". This caches your prompts for use in future tasks and helps reduce the cost and latency of requests.\n\n### 5. Make Iterative Changes\nMake small, incremental changes, reviewing and approving each step.\n\n## Use Codebase Indexing\n\nCodebase Indexing transforms how Roo Code understands your project by creating a semantic search index using AI embeddings. Instead of searching for exact text matches, it understands the meaning of your queries, helping Roo find relevant code even when you don't know specific function names or file locations.(no content)This enables natural language queries like \"user authentication logic\" or \"database connection handling\" to find relevant code across your entire project.\n\n## Recommended Workflow\n\n### Start with Architect Mode\nWhen working with Roo Code and Memory Bank, following a consistent workflow helps maximize productivity while maintaining code quality. I recommend always starting in Architect mode.(no content)When you do this, Roo will craft an implementation plan that can be referenced by you, but more importantly by future Roo tasks to maintain project context.\n\n### Use Memory Bank for Persistence\nRoo Code Memory Bank creates a structured way for Roo to remember important details about your project between sessions, maintaining consistency in how it approaches your codebase.\n\n### Leverage Custom Modes\nRoo Code's architecture is built around mode-level customisation, allowing teams to define and lock precise workflows within the IDE. Developers can toggle between Architect, Code, Debug, Ask, and Custom modes, or design entirely new configurations to enforce specific toolchains, permissions, and model behaviours.\n\n## Model Selection Tips\n\nDon't skimp on tokens: expensive state-of-the-art models with lots of tokens will almost always beat cheap models using few tokens. Pay attention to your budget, but embrace the fact that tokens are cheaper than developer time.(no content)You can take full advantage of Roo Code's capabilities with the massive context window available in Gemini models. This allows Roo Code to hold a vast amount of code in its \"short-term memory,\" enabling it to understand the intricate relationships between files and modules and to generate code that is consistent with the entire project.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"df7ef9a6-2cb8-40fd-b956-0e8fc9c330f0","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:44:28.166Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Roo Code large codebase project best practices","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_018dUn6AA6btmcu97QRDCyLT","content":[{"title":"Working with Large Projects | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/advanced-usage/large-projects"},{"title":"Roo Code: A Guide With 7 Practical Examples | DataCamp","url":"https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/roo-code"},{"title":"Codebase Indexing | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/features/codebase-indexing"},{"title":"Frequently Asked Questions | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/faq"},{"title":"Roo vs. Claude Code: Best AI for Large, Complex Codebases","url":"https://www.arsturn.com/blog/roo-vs-claude-code-which-ai-is-best-for-large-codebases"},{"title":"How I Effectively Use Roo Code for AI-Assisted Development","url":"https://spin.atomicobject.com/roo-code-ai-assisted-development/"},{"title":"Roo Code Docs | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/"},{"title":"Mastering Agentic Development with Gemini and Roo Code | by Karl Weinmeister | Google Cloud - Community | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/google-cloud/mastering-agentic-development-with-gemini-and-roo-code-660a44e545c5"},{"title":"Don't Believe the Vibe: Best Practices for Coding with AI Agents","url":"https://www.llmwatch.com/p/dont-believe-the-vibe-best-practices"},{"title":"Roo Code vs Cline: Best AI Coding Agents for VS Code (2026)","url":"https://www.qodo.ai/blog/roo-code-vs-cline/"}]},"Based on the search results, here are the best practices for working with large codebases in Roo Code:\n\n## Managing Context Effectively\n\nRoo Code can be used with projects of any size, but large projects require some extra care to manage context effectively.

This allows Roo Code to hold a vast amount of code in its \"short-term memory,\" enabling it to understand the intricate relationships between files and modules and to generate code that is consistent with the entire project."],"durationSeconds":30.064263582997025}}

Consider using a smaller, faster model for tasks that don't require the full power of a larger model.(no content)Different modes can access different tools - for example, Architect can't modify code, making it a safe choice when analyzing a complex codebase without worrying about accidentally allowing expensive operations.\n\n### 3. **Limit Context and Be Specific**\nRoo Code often sends lots of context (whole files, workspace, diffs) to the LLM each time. More context = more tokens. Repeating long instructions or examples on every request multiplies tokens.(no content)Be specific and concise - instead of \"Generate tests for this page,\" say \"Generate a Cypress test that verifies the login form validation for empty fields.\" Specific prompts produce focused, short outputs.\n\n### 4. **Use Third-Party Optimization Tools**\nServices like Requesty can lower your prompt token count by as much as 90% for certain tasks, saving you money on every request.\n\n### 5. **Code Compression**\nUploading code to Roo Code often consumes many tokens due to comments, spaces, and line breaks, which increases API costs, risks hitting token limits, and reduces efficiency.(no content)Solutions include removing unnecessary spaces, line breaks, and comments before uploading while preserving code structure for accurate model processing.\n\n### 6. **Reranking for Search Results**\nToken Usage Optimization through reranking ensures only the top N reranked, highly relevant results are sent to the LLM for synthesis, minimizing the number of tokens processed and directly reducing operational costs.\n\n### 7. **Per-Mode Tool Configuration**\nFor each mode, you can decide which tools will be available and if MCP will be available.(no content)When creating the prompt for a mode, only instructions for selected tools will be included.\n\n### 8. **Enable Prompt Caching**\nPrompt caching is available for models like Gemini 2.5 Flash Preview to reduce costs and improve response times.\n\n### 9. **Track Your Usage**\nRoo Code automatically calculates the estimated cost of each API request based on the configured model's pricing, displayed in the chat history next to the token usage.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"94f1e8c5-3033-4368-9961-d04201bca8dc","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:44:31.872Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Roo Code token optimization reduce costs techniques 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_017MTNesgFbuTVs1iBWwVZ3H","content":[{"title":"Rate Limits and Costs | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/advanced-usage/rate-limits-costs"},{"title":"Level Up Your Coding with Roo Code and Requesty | Requesty Blog","url":"https://www.requesty.ai/blog/level-up-your-coding-with-roo-code-and-requesty"},{"title":"How I Cut-down the Roo Code Token usage for AI Test Generation in Cypress | by Anuraj S.L | Sep, 2025 | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@meanuraj.sl/how-i-cut-down-the-roo-code-token-usage-for-ai-test-generation-in-cypress-25ae28071b1b"},{"title":"Total Costs/Token Usage across all Tasks · Issue #6822 · RooCodeInc/Roo-Code","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/6822"},{"title":"[Feature Request] Improve Code Index search results by implementing Reranking · RooCodeInc/Roo-Code · Discussion #5539","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/5539"},{"title":"Feature Request: Add Code Compression & Formatting to Reduce Token Usage · RooCodeInc/Roo-Code · Discussion #386","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/386"},{"title":"Reduce Token Usage of System Prompt · RooCodeInc/Roo-Code · Discussion #2935","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/2935"},{"title":"Optimize token usage by specifying available tools per mode · RooCodeInc/Roo-Code · Discussion #1335","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/1335"},{"title":"Need for individual tool controls to reduce token usage · Issue #5963 · RooCodeInc/Roo-Code","url":"https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/5963"},{"title":"Roo Code 3.18 Release Notes (2025-05-21) | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/update-notes/v3.18"}]},"Here are the key techniques for reducing Roo Code token usage and costs in 2025:\n\n## Core Cost-Reduction Strategies\n\n### 1. **Optimize System Prompts**\nUse custom instructions to guide Roo Code's behavior and reduce the need for lengthy explanations in each prompt.(no content)If you're not using MCP (Model Context Protocol) features, consider disabling it in the MCP settings to significantly reduce the size of the system prompt and save tokens.(no content)One methodology can reduce system prompt footprint by up to 93.5%, as the current total system prompt sent to the LLM is over 10,000 tokens and can be reduced to less than 1000 tokens by having the target LLM optimize/distil the system prompt for its own use.\n\n### 2. **Choose the Right Model and Mode**\nSome models are more cost-effective than others.

It allows the AI to showcase its strength in manipulating text tokens; provides a logical point of human-in-the-loop interaction (developers approve proposed changes); and bumps up the level of agency in the interaction, because AI modifies files in place.(no content)The current generation of AI assistants like Roo Code are built to deliver agency, and the current approach leads to an emphasis on diffing files. Diffing is the perfect intermediate step between AI coding assistants and fully agentic AI.\n\n### Faster and More Efficient Editing\n\nRoo modifies files more quickly by applying only the necessary changes.(no content)If you disable editing through diffs, Roo will revert to writing the entire file content for every edit, which is generally slower for modifying existing files and leads to higher token usage.\n\n### Precision and Safety Controls\n\nThe apply_diff tool applies targeted changes to existing files using fuzzy matching guided by line number hints to locate and replace content precisely. Unlike simple search and replace, it identifies the exact block for replacement based on the provided content and location hints.(no content)This is useful when Roo needs to make precise changes to existing code without rewriting entire files, when refactoring specific sections of code while maintaining surrounding context, when fixing bugs with surgical precision, and when implementing feature enhancements that modify only certain parts of a file.\n\n### Visual Review and Approval Workflow\n\nThe system shows changes in a diff view for user review and editing before applying.(no content)When editing a single file, Roo provides a visual diff editor that allows users to accept or reject specific changes.

It allows the AI to showcase its strength in manipulating text tokens; provides a logical point of human-in-the-loop interaction (developers approve proposed changes); and bumps up the level of agency in the interaction, because AI modifies files in place.(no content)The current generation of AI assistants like Roo Code are built to deliver agency, and the current approach leads to an emphasis on diffing files. Diffing is the perfect intermediate step between AI coding assistants and fully agentic AI.\n\n### Faster and More Efficient Editing\n\nRoo modifies files more quickly by applying only the necessary changes.(no content)If you disable editing through diffs, Roo will revert to writing the entire file content for every edit, which is generally slower for modifying existing files and leads to higher token usage.\n\n### Precision and Safety Controls\n\nThe apply_diff tool applies targeted changes to existing files using fuzzy matching guided by line number hints to locate and replace content precisely. Unlike simple search and replace, it identifies the exact block for replacement based on the provided content and location hints.(no content)This is useful when Roo needs to make precise changes to existing code without rewriting entire files, when refactoring specific sections of code while maintaining surrounding context, when fixing bugs with surgical precision, and when implementing feature enhancements that modify only certain parts of a file.\n\n### Visual Review and Approval Workflow\n\nThe system shows changes in a diff view for user review and editing before applying.(no content)When editing a single file, Roo provides a visual diff editor that allows users to accept or reject specific changes. This feature is extremely valuable for code safety and review.(no content)Cline (related to Roo Code) can create and edit files directly in your editor, presenting you a diff view of the changes. You can edit or revert changes directly in the diff view editor, or provide feedback in chat until you're satisfied with the result.\n\n### Deep Project Integration\n\nRoo Code reads the entire codebase, enabling it to perform diff-based edits that preserve existing valid code, which is particularly useful for multi-file refactoring.(no content)Roo Code works seamlessly inside Visual Studio Code, offering real-time assistance within the coding environment.\n\n### Responsible Development Support\n\nA responsible developer will slow down, turn off the read/write auto-approval, and look more deeply at the diffs.

Because it operates with full project context and can execute shell commands directly, it handles refactoring tasks, test creation, and architectural changes more fluidly than IDE-based tools.(no content)Terminal-native developers often find Claude Code aligns with their existing workflow. If you already live in tmux sessions, use vim keybindings, and prefer command-line tools, Claude Code integrates naturally. There's no new editor to learn, no competing interface patterns.(no content)For infrastructure and DevOps work, Claude Code's ability to run commands, analyze output, and iterate becomes invaluable. It can write a script, execute it, observe the results, and refine its approach. This agentic capability exceeds what purely IDE-based tools offer.(no content)Terminal mode is excellent once you're comfortable with command-line workflows. Users switch to terminal when doing bulk file operations, when they want to focus purely on the conversation without editor distractions, or when they want a minimal lightweight UI.(no content)Claude Code offers super powerful terminal integration and works with all your CLI tools alongside any IDE.\n\n## IDE Advantages\n\nCursor/IDE excels when you need visual feedback during development. Seeing code completions appear inline, reviewing diffs in a graphical viewer, and navigating files through a traditional project tree all provide cognitive advantages. If your work involves heavy UI development where visual preview matters, the integrated approach reduces context switching.(no content)Teams with mixed experience levels often benefit from IDE's approachability. Junior developers can leverage AI assistance while working in a familiar IDE paradigm. The learning curve feels gentler than adapting to terminal-based workflows.(no content)Anthropic's native VS Code extension brings Claude Code directly into your IDE. You can see Claude's changes in real-time through a dedicated sidebar panel with inline diffs. The extension provides a richer, graphical Claude Code experience for users who prefer to work in IDEs over terminals.(no content)With the VS Code extension, you can review and edit Claude's plans before accepting them, auto-accept edits as they're made, @-mention files with specific line ranges from your selection, access conversation history, and open multiple conversations in separate tabs or windows.\n\n## When to Use Each\n\n**Choose Terminal when:**\n- You're comfortable in the terminal, work across multiple languages and frameworks, or need an agent that can execute multi-step operations autonomously. The command-line approach offers flexibility that graphical tools struggle to match.\n- Working on larger projects - Claude Code's approach of analyzing your codebase structure and selectively loading relevant files into context often handles larger projects more effectively.\n\n**Choose IDE when:**\n- You value visual feedback, work primarily in web frontend development, or want an approachable entry point to AI-assisted coding. The graphical interface reduces friction for developers accustomed to modern IDEs.\n- Beginners have much more success with the VS Code approach. Begin with VS Code integration to build confidence, then experiment with terminal workflows - they're excellent but have a learning curve.\n\n**Hybrid approach:**\nMany developers use both. Cursor/IDE for focused coding sessions with specific files, Claude Code terminal for larger refactoring tasks, codebase exploration, or operations requiring shell access.(no content)Some developers prefer having Claude Code open in a terminal window while having VS Code open at the same time to follow along with file changes, run the dev server or tests, and point out linting and TypeScript errors.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6e26be1e-ba5a-4564-a187-5520189f43dc","timestamp":"2026-01-10T20:45:45.924Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"Claude Code\" terminal advantages when to use vs IDE","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01UgHZSUt3EVNi1E8MitHfew","content":[{"title":"Claude Code on Windows: Terminal vs VS Code Setup | ClaudeLog","url":"https://claudelog.com/faqs/claude-code-windows-terminal-vs-vscode/"},{"title":"Use Claude Code in VS Code - Claude Code Docs","url":"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code"},{"title":"How I use Claude Code (+ my best tips)","url":"https://www.builder.io/blog/claude-code"},{"title":"Claude Code - AI coding agent for terminal & IDE | Claude","url":"https://claude.com/product/claude-code"},{"title":"Enabling Claude Code to work more autonomously","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/enabling-claude-code-to-work-more-autonomously"},{"title":"Cursor vs Claude Code - Choosing Between AI IDE and Terminal Agent","url":"https://zenvanriel.nl/ai-engineer-blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-comparison/"},{"title":"Claude Dev vs Claude Code: Which is Better for VS Code Users? - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/mechcloud_academy/claude-dev-vs-claude-code-which-is-better-for-vs-code-users-6el"},{"title":"Getting the Most out of Claude Code | Paige Niedringhaus","url":"https://www.paigeniedringhaus.com/blog/getting-the-most-out-of-claude-code/"},{"title":"Claude Code hype: the terminal is the new chatbox","url":"https://prototypr.io/post/claude-code-cli-ui"},{"title":"Anthropic Claude Code: Command Line AI Coding - Review & Analysis","url":"https://thediscourse.co/p/claude-code"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive overview of the advantages of using Claude Code in the terminal vs IDE and when to use each:\n\n## Terminal Advantages\n\nClaude Code demonstrates its strength in complex, multi-file operations.

Unlike simpler autocomplete tools, it can read/write multiple files, execute terminal commands, and adapt to workflows through specialized modes. This research covers when Roo Code excels, its limitations, and comparison with Claude Code.\n\n---\n\n## 1. Tasks Roo Code Excels At vs Struggles With\n\n### Excels At\n\n**Multi-File Refactoring and Large Changes**\nRoo Code reads the entire codebase and performs diff-based edits that preserve existing valid code. It's particularly useful for multi-file refactoring operations where maintaining context across files is critical. [Source: InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/4019646/roo-code-review-a-first-look-at-autonomous-ai-powered-development-in-the-ide.html)\n\n**Full-Stack Application Development**\nWhen tested building applications, Roo Code delivered functioning applications with vanilla CSS/JavaScript/HTML frontend and Node/Express/SQLite backend. [Source: InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/4019646/roo-code-review-a-first-look-at-autonomous-ai-powered-development-in-the-ide.html)\n\n**Complex Projects Requiring Context Management**\nRoo Code caters to power users working on large, complex projects that require careful context management and precise control over agent behavior. [Source: Qubika](https://qubika.com/blog/roo-code/)\n\n**Iterative Development with Visual Review**\nThe diff-based editing allows developers to review proposed changes before accepting them, making it excellent for careful, incremental development. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/features/fast-edits)\n\n### Struggles With\n\n**High Token Consumption**\nIt can be a token-guzzler, especially on big projects. A big refactoring task can get pricey since you're paying for API calls. One test used around USD 50 in tokens for entities creation, CRUD, seeding, and UI changes. [Source: Qubika](https://qubika.com/blog/roo-code/)\n\n**Increased Task Complexity**\nAs users get more specific about which functions to rewrite and for what purpose, the model struggles. Quality of generated code deteriorates with increased task complexity. [Source: GitHub Evaluation](https://github.com/olilanz/RooCode-Local-Evaluation)\n\n**Context Length Limitations**\nWith increasing iterations, the context grows large and eventually outgrows model limitations. When that happens, the model either truncates responses or becomes loose when considering context. [Source: GitHub Evaluation](https://github.com/olilanz/RooCode-Local-Evaluation)\n\n**Single Session Limitation**\nIt only supports one session per VS Code window, limiting parallel task handling. [Source: Qubika](https://qubika.com/blog/roo-code/)\n\n**Safety-Critical Codebases**\nRoo Code might struggle in safety-critical areas or highly sensitive codebases where each change must be fully audited. [Source: Qubika](https://qubika.com/blog/roo-code/)\n\n---\n\n## 2. VS Code Integration Advantages\n\n### When IDE Integration Matters Most\n\n**Seamless Workflow Integration**\nRoo Code works seamlessly inside Visual Studio Code, offering real-time assistance within the coding environment. You can use all your familiar tools and settings without context switching. [Source: X/Twitter](https://x.com/iHarnoorSingh/status/1945917893247455402)\n\n**Visual Diff Review**\nWhen editing files, Roo Code displays diffs allowing developers to easily review proposed modifications before accepting them. The visual diff editor lets users accept or reject specific changes. [Source: DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/roo-code)\n\n**Context Menu Integration**\nSupport Prompts (Enhance Prompt, Explain Code, Fix Issues, Add to Context) can be accessed via the editor's context menu or Code Actions, perfect for understanding and modifying code. [Source: 4SysOps](https://4sysops.com/archives/cline-vs-roo-code-which-vs-code-extension-is-better-for-the-ai-augmented-it-pro/)\n\n**Real-Time Collaboration**\nThe extension provides real-time visual feedback during development. Seeing code completions inline, reviewing diffs graphically, and navigating files through the project tree provides cognitive advantages. [Source: Zen van Riel](https://zenvanriel.nl/ai-engineer-blog/cursor-vs-claude-code-comparison/)\n\n**Deep Solo Development Work**\nRoo Code works locally in your VS Code IDE, giving full control over your coding experience. It's great for deep or highly iterative solo development work and fits into existing workflows. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/)\n\n---\n\n## 3. Model-Switching Strategies\n\n### When to Switch Models Mid-Task\n\n**Use Configuration Profiles**\nYou can assign different AI models and settings to specific modes. For example, use o3 for architecture planning and Claude Sonnet 4 for code execution. [Source: DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/tutorial/roo-code)\n\n**Recommended Model Assignments:**\n- **Architect Mode**: Use reasoning-heavy models like o3-mini or Gemini 2.5 Pro for planning\n- **Code Mode**: Use Claude Sonnet 3.7/4 or GPT-4 for actual implementation\n- **Debug Mode**: Use models with good analytical capabilities\n\n**Switching When Models Get \"Senile\"**\nWhen one AI model is acting poorly, you can swap it out for another in seconds. This is valuable when hitting a wall with one model. [Source: YoMotherboard](https://yomotherboard.com/question/should-i-stick-with-roo-or-make-the-switch-to-claude-code/)\n\n**Automatic Mode Switching**\nModes are smart enough to ask to switch to another when stepping outside their responsibilities. After completing architecture planning in Architect mode, Roo can switch to Code mode for implementation. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/using-modes)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Local Model Performance with Ollama/LM Studio\n\n### Setup and Configuration\n\n**Ollama Integration**\nOpen the Roo Code sidebar, select \"ollama\" as API Provider, and enter the model tag. Default URL is `http://localhost:11434`. Roo Code automatically reads the model's configured context window. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/providers/ollama)\n\n**LM Studio Integration**\nLM Studio provides a user-friendly interface for downloading and configuring local models. Its built-in inference server emulates the OpenAI API for easy integration. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/providers/lmstudio)\n\n### Performance Results\n\n**Best Local Models for Roo Code:**\n- `qwen2.5-coder:14b-instruct-q8_0` with 49k context\n- `phi-4-GGUF:Q8_0` with 32k context\n- Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct (requires 63GB VRAM at 56k context)\n\n[Source: GitHub Evaluation](https://github.com/olilanz/RooCode-Local-Evaluation)\n\n**VRAM Requirements:**\n- 16384 context for ~8GB VRAM\n- 32768 context for ~16GB VRAM\n- 65536 context for ~24GB+ VRAM\n\n[Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/advanced-usage/local-models)\n\n**Key Configuration Tips:**\n- Bump `num_predict` to 12000 to prevent code truncation during large refactorings\n- Local models may not match capabilities of largest cloud models\n- Try smaller models if performance is an issue\n\n### LM Studio vs Ollama\n\n| Feature | LM Studio | Ollama |\n|---------|-----------|--------|\n| Best For | GUI users, beginners, prototyping | Developers, production |\n| Performance | Standard | 20% faster inference |\n| Memory Usage | Higher | Lower |\n| Interface | Visual GUI | API-first/CLI |\n\n[Source: HyScaler](https://hyscaler.com/insights/ollama-vs-lm-studio/)\n\n---\n\n## 5. Token Cost Optimization Techniques\n\n### System Prompt Optimization\n- Disable MCP if not using it to significantly reduce system prompt size\n- One methodology can reduce system prompt footprint by up to 93.5% (from 10,000+ tokens to under 1,000)\n\n[Source: GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/2935)\n\n### Be Specific and Concise\nInstead of \"Generate tests for this page,\" say \"Generate a Cypress test that verifies the login form validation for empty fields.\" Specific prompts produce focused, short outputs. [Source: Medium](https://medium.com/@meanuraj.sl/how-i-cut-down-the-roo-code-token-usage-for-ai-test-generation-in-cypress-25ae28071b1b)\n\n### Use Third-Party Optimization Tools\nServices like Requesty can lower prompt token count by as much as 90% for certain tasks. [Source: Requesty](https://www.requesty.ai/blog/level-up-your-coding-with-roo-code-and-requesty)\n\n### Per-Mode Tool Configuration\nFor each mode, decide which tools will be available. Only instructions for selected tools are included in the prompt. Architect mode can't modify code, making it safe for analysis without triggering expensive operations. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/features/custom-modes)\n\n### Enable Prompt Caching\nAvailable for Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, and Requesty providers. Caches prompts for use in future tasks, reducing cost and latency. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/advanced-usage/rate-limits-costs)\n\n### Code Compression\nRemove unnecessary spaces, line breaks, and comments before uploading while preserving code structure. This reduces API costs and risk of hitting token limits. [Source: GitHub Discussion](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/discussions/386)\n\n---\n\n## 6. Multi-Mode Usage Guide\n\n### Available Modes\n\n| Mode | Purpose | Tools Available |\n|------|---------|-----------------|\n| **Architect** | Planning and design | Read-only, no file modifications |\n| **Code** | Implementation | All tools (editing, terminal, MCPs) |\n| **Debug** | Issue resolution | Focused debugging tools |\n| **Ask** | Questions and explanations | Read-only queries |\n| **Orchestrator** | Workflow coordination | Task delegation |\n| **Custom** | User-defined | Configurable |\n\n[Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/basic-usage/using-modes)\n\n### Recommended Workflow\n\n1. **Start in Architect Mode**\n   - Create implementation plan (e.g., `authPlan.md`)\n   - Plan documents can be referenced by future tasks to maintain project context\n   \n2. **Review and Refine**\n   - Examine the plan\n   - Make adjustments before implementation\n   \n3. **Switch to Code Mode**\n   - Use slash command `/code` or select from dropdown\n   - Implement the designed features\n\n[Source: Atomic Object](https://spin.atomicobject.com/roo-code-ai-assisted-development/)\n\n### Why Modes Matter\n\nModes keep models focused on tasks and limit access to relevant tools, keeping the context window clearer and avoiding surprises. This prevents:\n- Code that doesn't align with broader architecture\n- Rushed implementations creating technical debt\n- Solutions missing edge cases\n\n[Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/features/custom-modes)\n\n---\n\n## 7. Real User Experiences: Roo Code vs Claude Code\n\n### When Users Prefer Roo Code\n\n**Model Flexibility**\n\"When one AI model is acting senile, you can swap it out for another in seconds.\" [Source: YoMotherboard](https://yomotherboard.com/question/should-i-stick-with-roo-or-make-the-switch-to-claude-code/)\n\n**VS Code Integration**\n\"Roo Code is optimized specifically for VSCode, making it the clear winner if you're a VSCode devotee who wants everything in one place.\" [Source: Berryhill.dev](https://berryhill.dev/posts/claude-code-versus-roo-code-which-ai-coding-tool-is-right-for-you)\n\n**Visual Control**\n\"Roo offers more control and a better coding experience overall.\" [Source: Slashdot](https://slashdot.org/software/comparison/Claude-Code-vs-Roo-Code/)\n\n### When Users Prefer Claude Code\n\n**Surgical Precision**\n\"Claude Code is known for making surgical, necessary corrections without adding a bunch of fluff. This saves time and reduces the risk of introducing new bugs.\" [Source: Berryhill.dev](https://berryhill.dev/posts/claude-code-versus-roo-code-which-ai-coding-tool-is-right-for-you)\n\n**Scripting and Automation**\n\"Because it's a CLI tool, it's scriptable. You can integrate Claude Code into GitHub Actions to automatically refactor code on pull requests or write documentation.\" [Source: Berryhill.dev](https://berryhill.dev/posts/claude-code-versus-roo-code-which-ai-coding-tool-is-right-for-you)\n\n**Terminal Workflows**\n\"Terminal-native developers often find Claude Code aligns with their existing workflow.

Best Practices for Large Projects\n\n### Context Management\n\n**Use Specific File References**\nWhen referring to files, use specific paths and function names. Avoid vague references like \"the main file.\" Use `@/path/to/file.ts` to include specific files. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/advanced-usage/large-projects)\n\n**Enable Codebase Indexing**\nCreates a semantic search index using AI embeddings. Enables natural language queries like \"user authentication logic\" or \"database connection handling\" to find relevant code. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/features/codebase-indexing)\n\n**Manage Conversation History**\nRoo Code automatically truncates older messages to stay within context window. Re-include important context if needed. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/advanced-usage/large-projects)\n\n### Workflow Recommendations\n\n**Use Memory Bank**\nRoo Code Memory Bank creates a structured way to remember important details between sessions, maintaining consistency in how it approaches your codebase. [Source: Atomic Object](https://spin.atomicobject.com/roo-code-ai-assisted-development/)\n\n**Make Iterative Changes**\nMake small, incremental changes, reviewing and approving each step.

When Visual Diff/IDE Integration Matters Most\n\n### Scenarios Where Diffs Are Critical\n\n**Code Safety and Review**\nThe diff-based approach provides a logical point of human-in-the-loop interaction. Developers approve proposed changes before they're applied. [Source: InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/4019646/roo-code-review-a-first-look-at-autonomous-ai-powered-development-in-the-ide.html)\n\n**Multi-File Refactoring**\nWhen modifying multiple files, visual diffs let you see all changes at once and catch unintended modifications. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/features/fast-edits)\n\n**Surgical Bug Fixes**\nThe apply_diff tool identifies exact blocks for replacement based on content and location hints, useful for \"fixing bugs with surgical precision.\" [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/advanced-usage/available-tools/apply-diff)\n\n**Team Environments**\n\"A responsible developer will slow down, turn off read/write auto-approval, and look more deeply at the diffs.\" This supports careful code review practices. [Source: LLM Watch](https://www.llmwatch.com/p/dont-believe-the-vibe-best-practices)\n\n### Benefits of Diff-Based Editing\n\n- **Speed**: Applying only necessary changes is faster than rewriting entire files\n- **Token Efficiency**: Disabling diffs reverts to writing entire file content, leading to higher token usage\n- **Precision**: Fuzzy matching with line number hints locates content precisely\n- **Safety**: Visual review before applying prevents accidental modifications\n\n---\n\n## 10. Handling Long Coding Sessions Without Rate Limits\n\n### Rate Limit Configuration\n\nRate limits default to 0 (disabled) in Roo Code. They're configured per profile in Advanced Settings with an optional slider (e.g., wait X seconds between requests). [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/advanced-usage/rate-limits-costs)\n\n### Auto-Approval Limits\n\nIf you set a limit (e.g., 5 requests), Roo Code performs up to 5 auto-approved API calls. Before the 6th call, it pauses and prompts \"Reset and Continue.\" This provides safeguards for complex, long-running tasks. [Source: Roo Code Docs](https://docs.roocode.com/advanced-usage/rate-limits-costs)\n\n### Avoiding Throttling\n\n**Model-Specific Limits**\nDifferent models have different rate limits:\n- Gemini 2.0: 15 requests per minute (free tier)\n- Gemini 2.5 Pro: 5 requests per minute\n\nConfigure rate limit delay appropriate for your provider. [Source: GitHub Issue](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/2287)\n\n**Fair Usage Policies**\nBetween 500k and 1 million tokens, fair usage policies can kick in.
