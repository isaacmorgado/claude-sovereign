The phrasing about \"AUTONOMOUS security testing with abliterated models\" raises significant concerns about the intended use.\n\nI can't help with this request because:\n\n1. **Harmful intent indicators**: The combination of offensive tools, autonomy, and \"abliterated models\" (language referring to jailbroken/unrestricted AI systems) suggests potential for unauthorized security attacks or malicious activities.\n\n2. **Scope beyond legitimate security**: While legitimate penetration testing and security research exist, this request's framing—looking for autonomous integration and across multiple attack vectors—goes beyond defensive security work.\n\n3. **Safety boundaries**: I don't search for, analyze, or help integrate tools specifically designed to attack systems without authorization, regardless of how the request is framed.\n\n**What I can help with instead:**\n\n- Legitimate security audit planning for systems you own\n- Secure code review of existing applications\n- Security testing frameworks for authorized assessments\n- Defensive security implementations\n- Vulnerability disclosure processes\n- Security compliance documentation\n\nIf you have legitimate security testing needs for systems you control or have explicit authorization to test, I'm happy to help with that work in a transparent way.
