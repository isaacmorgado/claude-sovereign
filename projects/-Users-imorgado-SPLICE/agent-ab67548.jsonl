Instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has 1 unified environment for frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction back and forth.(no content)UXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over CEP, where communication happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment.\n\n### API Types\n\nThe UXP platform provides two complementary sets of APIs: UXP Core APIs for building user interfaces, file operations, network calls, and general functionality; and Premiere APIs for interacting with and modifying Premiere projects and sequences.\n\n### Version Information\n\nPremiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.(no content)UXP is a JavaScript-based extensibility platform (ES6/ECMAScript 2015 compliant).\n\n### ExtendScript Deprecation Timeline\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP.

For a smooth transition between the ExtendScript DOM and the UXP DOM, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\"\n\n### Current Status (2024-2025)\n\nOn Dec 5th, 2024, Adobe opened their public beta for UXP Plugins in Premiere Pro.(no content)UXP has officially graduated from beta and is now available in Adobe Premiere 25.6, representing a major step forward in modernizing the extensibility ecosystem.\n\n### Architecture Differences from CEP\n\nUXP Plugins are JavaScript/HTML/CSS based but built on Adobe's own unique stack, making them far less resource heavy than CEP's Node.js + Chromium stack. Instead of a JavaScript frontend and ExtendScript backend like CEP, UXP has 1 unified environment for frontend code and host API calls, minimizing friction back and forth.(no content)UXP provides a unified JavaScript engine that has direct access to both the Premiere APIs and the UXP Core APIs. This is a big advantage over CEP, where communication happened through a bridge (CSInterface) that passed messages back and forth between two runtimes. With UXP, everything runs natively in the same environment.\n\n### API Types\n\nThe UXP platform provides two complementary sets of APIs: UXP Core APIs for building user interfaces, file operations, network calls, and general functionality; and Premiere APIs for interacting with and modifying Premiere projects and sequences.\n\n### Version Information\n\nPremiere v25.6 includes UXP v8.1.(no content)UXP is a JavaScript-based extensibility platform (ES6/ECMAScript 2015 compliant).\n\n### ExtendScript Deprecation Timeline\n\nAs of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP. ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported, and the plan is for them to remain so through September 2026.\n\n### Hybrid Plugins Note\n\nUXP has the unique ability of including a C++ Hybrid plugin aspect to run computationally heavy tasks or interact with a host app's C++ APIs directly from the plugin. However, UXP Hybrid plugins are not yet implemented in Premiere Pro but will be in the future."],"durationSeconds":23.691986124999822}}

In UXP, method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition between the ExtendScript DOM and the UXP DOM, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n3. Permission-based APIs need to be allow-listed in your plugin's manifest.json.\n\n4.

Example manifest configuration:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"permissions\": {\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": [\n        \"https://www.adobe.com\",\n        \"https://*.adobeprerelease.com\",\n        \"wss://*.myplugin.com\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\nThe domains in the plugin's manifest also let you configure variations of the endpoints. For example, your plugin may like to access 'api.dev.example.com', 'api.stage.example.com' or 'api.prod.example.com' depending upon the environment. You can configure the domains with [\"https://api.*.example.com\"] to manage all three.\n\n### Global Await for Scripts\n\nThe await in front of async functions is referred to as global await. It keeps the UXP Script waiting for an async task to complete at a global scope. You are allowed to have as many global awaits as you would like, but keep in mind that each await halts the execution.(no content)A network call is asynchronous and it may take a few seconds for it to resolve. And the script should wait for such operations somehow. This is handled by using global await, which makes asynchronous code behave like synchronous operations.\n\n### Version Requirements\n\nFor InDesign: InDesign v18.5 or higher, UDT v1.9.0 or higher, Manifest version v5 or higher.\n\n### Recommendations\n\nXD plugins support asynchronous code with both Promises and async/await.

The UI rendering uses native controls (not Chromium), which is more performant.\n\n3. **Network requests (fetch) can run in background** - You can run network requests and timers entirely in the background, outside of any edit operation.\n\n4. **Property access is synchronous by design** - For ease of migration from ExtendScript, property getters/setters are synchronous and don't need `await`, though they're asynchronous under the hood.\n\n---\n\n## Limitations and Caveats\n\n| Limitation | Description |\n|------------|-------------|\n| **Background code can slow host app** | Running code in background is discouraged as it can make the host application slow |\n| **Read-only access during background ops** | Background code may see incorrect intermediate state if running during other async operations |\n| **No Web Workers** | UXP does not support Web Workers for true multi-threading |\n| **No C++ Hybrid plugins yet** | Premiere Pro doesn't yet support UXP Hybrid plugins for computationally heavy C++ tasks (planned for future) |\n| **HTTP vs HTTPS bug** | Known issue in Premiere 25.6.3 where HTTP requests fail (HTTPS works) |\n\n---\n\n## Code Examples\n\n### Basic Async Fetch Pattern\n\n```javascript\nasync function fetchData() {\n  try {\n    const response = await fetch(\"https://api.example.com/data\");\n    if (!response.ok) {\n      throw new Error(`HTTP error ${response.status}: ${response.statusText}`);\n    }\n    const data = await response.json();\n    console.log(data);\n    return data;\n  } catch (err) {\n    console.error(\"Fetch error:\", err);\n  }\n}\n\n// Call without blocking - user can continue editing\nfetchData().then(result => {\n  // Update UI with result\n  updatePanel(result);\n});\n```\n\n### Manifest Configuration for Network Access\n\n```json\n{\n  \"requiredPermissions\": {\n    \"network\": {\n      \"domains\": [\n        \"https://api.example.com\",\n        \"https://*.yourservice.com\"\n      ]\n    }\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Non-Blocking Timer Pattern\n\n```javascript\n// setTimeout is available in UXP\nfunction pollForChanges() {\n  setTimeout(async () => {\n    const status = await checkStatus();\n    if (!status.complete) {\n      pollForChanges(); // Continue polling\n    } else {\n      updateUI(status);\n    }\n  }, 1000);\n}\n```\n\n### Accessing Premiere API (Async Methods)\n\n```javascript\nconst ppro = require(\"ppro\");\n\nasync function getProjectInfo() {\n  // Method calls are async and non-blocking\n  const project = await ppro.Project.getActiveProject();\n  const sequences = await project.getSequences();\n  \n  // Properties are synchronous (no await needed)\n  const projectName = project.name;\n  \n  return { projectName, sequences };\n}\n\n// This runs without blocking the UI\ngetProjectInfo().then(info => {\n  console.log(`Project: ${info.projectName}`);\n});\n```\n\n### Parallel Async Operations\n\n```javascript\nasync function loadMultipleResources() {\n  // Run multiple fetches in parallel - UI remains responsive\n  const [userData, settingsData, templatesData] = await Promise.all([\n    fetch(\"https://api.example.com/user\").then(r => r.json()),\n    fetch(\"https://api.example.com/settings\").then(r => r.json()),\n    fetch(\"https://api.example.com/templates\").then(r => r.json())\n  ]);\n  \n  return { userData, settingsData, templatesData };\n}\n```\n\n---\n\n## Threading Model Summary\n\n```\n+--------------------------------------------------+\n|              Premiere Pro Process                 |\n|                                                   |\n|  +------------------+    +--------------------+   |\n|  |   Premiere UI    |    |    UXP Plugin      |   |\n|  |   Main Thread    |    |   (Own Thread)     |   |\n|  |                  |    |                    |   |\n|  |  - Timeline      |    | - JavaScript V8    |   |\n|  |  - Preview       |    | - Native UI        |   |\n|  |  - Panels        |    | - async/await      |   |\n|  |                  |    | - fetch API        |   |\n|  +--------+---------+    +----------+---------+   |\n|           |                         |             |\n|           +----Native API Bridge----+             |\n|             (No string passing)                   |\n+--------------------------------------------------+\n```\n\n---\n\n## Official Documentation Links\n\n- [The Premiere UXP API - Main Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Understanding UXP APIs](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/)\n- [Premiere API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro Samples (GitHub)](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [UXP Arrives in Premiere - Adobe Blog](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development)\n- [Network Recipes - InDesign UXP (applicable patterns)](https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/resources/recipes/network/)\n- [Sync/Async - XD UXP Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/develop/plugin-development/javascript-and-xd/sync-async/)\n- [executeAsModal - Photoshop UXP (for comparison)](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/ps_reference/media/executeasmodal/)\n\n---\n\n## Best Practices for Non-Blocking Operations\n\n1. **Use async/await consistently** - Adobe recommends async/await over raw Promises\n2. **Avoid long-running synchronous loops** - Break them up with `setTimeout` or `requestAnimationFrame`\n3. **Use Promise.all for parallel operations** - Maximizes efficiency without blocking\n4. **Keep background operations minimal** - Excessive background code can slow Premiere\n5. **Handle errors gracefully** - Network failures shouldn't crash the plugin\n6. **Use the UXP-optimized library** for rendering long lists efficiently: [adobe/uxp-optimized](https://github.com/adobe/uxp-optimized)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2168,"cache_read_input_tokens":22581,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2168,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWF79UAFT3jZecp2CwYqG","type":"assistant","uuid":"2494b626-7047-401c-a289-5af01c1fbd8a","timestamp":"2025-12-19T00:34:41.883Z"}
