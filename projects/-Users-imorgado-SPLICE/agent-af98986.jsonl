It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.(no content)The Unified Extensibility Platform (UXP) has officially graduated from beta and is now available in Adobe Premiere 25.6. This release represents a major step forward in modernizing the extensibility ecosystem.\n\n## The `createSetNameAction` Method\n\nThe `createSetNameAction` method is available on multiple objects in the Premiere Pro UXP API:\n\n1. **ProjectItem**: `createSetNameAction(inName: string): Action` returns an action that renames a projectItem.\n\n2. **TrackItem**: `createSetNameAction(inName: string): Action` returns an action that renames the trackItem.\n\n3. **Marker**: `createSetNameAction(name: string): Action` returns an action to set the name of the marker.\n\n## Action Executor Pattern\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while they were executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread.\n\n### Common Issues and Solutions\n\nCommunity discussions reveal important patterns for executing actions:\n\nUsers have been trying to use UXP action methods like `createInsertProjectItemAction()` to insert clips into timelines, but have encountered \"Script Action failed to execute\" errors.(no content)The solution involves using `lockedAccess` and `executeTransaction` to properly execute actions. This pattern applies to various actions including `createAddMarkerAction`.\n\n## Additional Action Methods\n\nThe API includes many other action creators:\n- `createInsertComponentAction`, `createAppendComponentAction`, and `createRemoveComponentAction` for managing components in the audio component chain.\n- `createSetDurationAction(tickTime: TickTime)` returns an action to set the duration of the marker.\n- `createSetTypeAction(markerType: string)` returns an action to set the type of the marker.\n\n## Resources\n\nAdobe has updated their sample code to help developers. The Sample SDK provides practical examples of how to interact with the Premiere API using UXP.(no content)The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.(no content)As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP.

There is no `app.executeAction()` or `ActionManager` pattern like in Photoshop UXP.\n\n### The Core Pattern\n\n```javascript\nconst ppro = require(\"premierepro\");\n\nasync function executeActions() {\n    const project = await ppro.Project.getActiveProject();\n    \n    project.lockedAccess(() => {\n        project.executeTransaction((compoundAction) => {\n            // Create actions INSIDE the transaction\n            const action = someObject.createSetNameAction(\"New Name\");\n            compoundAction.addAction(action);\n        }, \"Undo Label\");  // optional undo string\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### Key Methods\n\n| Method | Purpose |\n|--------|---------|\n| `project.lockedAccess(callback)` | Secures exclusive access to the project during modifications |\n| `project.executeTransaction(callback, undoString?)` | Creates a transaction context with a `CompoundAction` |\n| `compoundAction.addAction(action)` | Adds an action to be executed; returns boolean for success |\n\n### Critical Requirement\n\n**Actions must be created INSIDE the `executeTransaction()` callback**, not before it. Creating actions outside and then adding them will cause \"Script Action failed to execute\" errors.\n\n### Complete Working Example\n\n```javascript\nconst ppro = require(\"premierepro\");\n\nasync function renameAndInsertClip() {\n    try {\n        const project = await ppro.Project.getActiveProject();\n        const sequence = await project.getActiveSequence();\n        const seqEditor = await ppro.SequenceEditor.getEditor(sequence);\n        const rootItem = await project.getRootItem();\n        const items = await rootItem.getItems();\n        const insertTime = await ppro.TickTime.createWithSeconds(5);\n        \n        project.lockedAccess(() => {\n            project.executeTransaction((compoundAction) => {\n                // Multiple actions can be batched together\n                const renameAction = items[0].createSetNameAction(\"Renamed Clip\");\n                compoundAction.addAction(renameAction);\n                \n                const insertAction = seqEditor.createInsertProjectItemAction(\n                    items[0], \n                    insertTime, \n                    0,  // video track index\n                    0,  // audio track index\n                    true  // only shift input track\n                );\n                compoundAction.addAction(insertAction);\n            }, \"Rename and Insert Clip\");\n        });\n    } catch (err) {\n        console.log(`Error: ${err}`);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### TypeScript Definitions\n\n```typescript\n// Action - marker interface for executable operations\ntype Action = {}\n\n// CompoundAction - container for batching actions\ntype CompoundAction = {\n    addAction(action: Action): boolean\n    empty: boolean\n}\n\n// Project methods\nexecuteTransaction(callback: (compoundAction: CompoundAction) => void, \n                   undoString?: string): boolean\nlockedAccess(callback: () => void): void\n```\n\n### Why This Pattern?\n\nUnlike ExtendScript where all calls were synchronous and blocked the UI, UXP uses asynchronous operations. The `lockedAccess` + `executeTransaction` pattern:\n\n1. Ensures thread safety during modifications\n2. Groups multiple actions into a single undoable operation\n3. Provides atomicity - all actions succeed or fail together\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [How to use 'Action' in PremierePro UXP? - Adobe Developer Forums](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/how-to-use-action-in-premierepro-uxp/8867)\n- [Help with createInsertProjectItemAction - Adobe Community](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/help-with-the-new-uxp-createinsertprojectitemaction-method-quot-script-action-failed-to-execute-quot/m-p/15239302)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro TypeScript Definitions - GitHub](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":1227,"cache_read_input_tokens":15354,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":1227,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGYaKTyrDrzx6Zrc2dbx","type":"assistant","uuid":"1b2a19a7-93d9-4557-b6f8-21d00c002726","timestamp":"2025-12-19T18:48:35.811Z"}
