Here's a comprehensive summary of what the search revealed:\n\n## Major Security Issues\n\n43% of MCP servers suffer from command injection flaws that enable remote code execution, with dozens of instances allowing arbitrary command execution on host machines. The MCP Inspector proxy server was listening on 0.0.0.0 with no authentication and lacked CSRF protection, creating vulnerabilities for remote exploitation.\n\n## Real-World Incidents\n\nSeveral serious security failures have occurred:\n- Asana experienced a multi-tenant access control failure where one customer could access another customer's data due to shared infrastructure without properly isolated auth tokens\n- Atlassian's Jira Service Management integration was exploited in a \"Living Off AI\" attack discovered by Cato Networks\n- MCP Inspector was vulnerable to CSRF attacks where malicious websites could silently send commands, allowing attackers to run shell commands and exfiltrate data\n\n## Tool and Performance Limitations\n\nTool limitations are the most significant factor limiting MCP server use, with Cursor limiting tools to 30, and more tools shrinking the LLM context window. Users face issues where after around 30 read_file operations, agents give up as they near their full context window, making simple queries impossible.\n\n## Authentication and Authorization Problems\n\nOAuth is often skipped or poorly implemented, with many public MCP servers not verifying requests or protecting user sessions, and some accepting unauthenticated calls. There's a \"confused deputy\" risk where users could gain access to resources available to the MCP server, violating the principle of least privilege.\n\n## Supply Chain and Tool Poisoning\n\nMCP servers face rug pull and tool poisoning attacks where approved servers are later updated with malicious tool definitions that include harmful instructions to automatically delete resources. Academic research identified 5.5% of servers exhibiting MCP-specific tool poisoning attacks.\n\n## Infrastructure and Deployment Challenges\n\nMCP servers overloaded with too many concurrent requests or processing large data can experience CPU spikes and memory leaks. Dependency and runtime environment conflicts are a major hurdle, with servers failing due to incorrect Node.js versions, missing Python packages, or conflicting libraries.\n\nThe search results indicate MCP is a rapidly evolving technology with significant security vulnerabilities and practical limitations that developers need to carefully address.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"5e5e9cac-ad93-43de-8bcc-757513bc959e","timestamp":"2026-01-10T21:08:09.307Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"MCP servers problems issues bugs limitations real world","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_019G4jLS3eBVGVnc3NX2CZiz","content":[{"title":"The MCP Security Survival Guide: Best Practices, Pitfalls, and Real-World Lessons | Towards Data Science","url":"https://towardsdatascience.com/the-mcp-security-survival-guide-best-practices-pitfalls-and-real-world-lessons/"},{"title":"Threat Research: Hundreds of MCP Servers Vulnerable to Abuse - Backslash","url":"https://www.backslash.security/blog/hundreds-of-mcp-servers-vulnerable-to-abuse"},{"title":"MCP Security Issues Threatening AI Infrastructure | Docker","url":"https://www.docker.com/blog/mcp-security-issues-threatening-ai-infrastructure/"},{"title":"MCP Vulnerabilities Every Developer Should Know - Composio","url":"https://composio.dev/blog/mcp-vulnerabilities-every-developer-should-know"},{"title":"Everything Wrong with MCP - by Shrivu Shankar","url":"https://blog.sshh.io/p/everything-wrong-with-mcp"},{"title":"MCP Known Issues: Common Problems & Troubleshooting 2025","url":"https://www.byteplus.com/en/topic/541583"},{"title":"MCP: Untrusted Servers and Confused Clients, Plus a Sneaky Exploit · Embrace The Red","url":"https://embracethered.com/blog/posts/2025/model-context-protocol-security-risks-and-exploits/"},{"title":"Overcoming Common Challenges in Setting Up MCP Servers","url":"https://www.arsturn.com/blog/overcoming-common-challenges-in-setting-up-mcp-servers"},{"title":"Understanding MCP security: Common risks to watch for | Datadog","url":"https://www.datadoghq.com/blog/monitor-mcp-servers/"},{"title":"Model Context Protocol (MCP): Understanding security risks and controls","url":"https://www.redhat.com/en/blog/model-context-protocol-mcp-understanding-security-risks-and-controls"}]},"I've completed the web search for MCP servers problems, issues, bugs, limitations, and real-world challenges.

There's a \"confused deputy\" risk where users could gain access to resources available to the MCP server, violating the principle of least privilege.\n\n## Supply Chain and Tool Poisoning\n\nMCP servers face rug pull and tool poisoning attacks where approved servers are later updated with malicious tool definitions that include harmful instructions to automatically delete resources. Academic research identified 5.5% of servers exhibiting MCP-specific tool poisoning attacks.\n\n## Infrastructure and Deployment Challenges\n\nMCP servers overloaded with too many concurrent requests or processing large data can experience CPU spikes and memory leaks. Dependency and runtime environment conflicts are a major hurdle, with servers failing due to incorrect Node.js versions, missing Python packages, or conflicting libraries.\n\nThe search results indicate MCP is a rapidly evolving technology with significant security vulnerabilities and practical limitations that developers need to carefully address."],"durationSeconds":24.267881207995117}}

Key security requirements include:\n\n- **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)**: All MCP auth flows must follow the OAuth 2.1 standard, which requires using PKCE to protect authorization code exchanges\n- **Token Validation**: MCP servers MUST only accept tokens that are valid for use with their own resources. MCP servers MUST NOT accept or transit any other tokens\n\n### Discovery and Metadata\n\nThe spec encourages Metadata Discovery, allowing servers to advertise their OAuth endpoints automatically. This means less manual configuration and fewer errors. Specifically:\n\n- MCP servers should share standard metadata (RFC 8414) so clients can easily find supported endpoints and features\n- Implement and publish on your MCP server a well-known endpoint (/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource) that tells clients how to authenticate and where to discover keys\n\n### Dynamic Client Registration (DCR)\n\nDCR allows MCP clients (like a generic AI workbench) to programmatically register themselves with a new MCP server they've never seen before. This avoids forcing users through tedious manual setup processes for every new connection, which is critical in a potentially vast landscape of model servers.\n\n### Scope Management\n\nWhen implementing authorization flows, MCP clients SHOULD follow the principle of least privilege by requesting only the scopes necessary for their intended operations.\n\n### Resource Indicators\n\nRFC 8707 Resource Indicators provide critical security benefits by binding tokens to their intended audiences when the Authorization Server supports the capability.\n\n### Separation of Concerns\n\nIt has emerged as a best practice to separate the authorization server from the resource server. This architectural pattern allows organizations to leverage existing authorization infrastructure.\n\n### Implementation Approach\n\nThe four-step process—registration, metadata implementation, token validation, and scope verification — provides a solid foundation for secure AI integrations.\n\nThese best practices ensure that MCP servers can securely authenticate users, manage permissions appropriately, and integrate with enterprise systems while maintaining compliance and user trust.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"19de31cd-4e4a-4ddc-b08a-d0a8444599be","timestamp":"2026-01-10T21:08:42.934Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"MCP server authentication OAuth configuration best practices","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01EZVeCTB7PgZSmvw2tKbkX9","content":[{"title":"Authorization - Model Context Protocol","url":"https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/authorization"},{"title":"An Introduction to MCP and Authorization | Auth0","url":"https://auth0.com/blog/an-introduction-to-mcp-and-authorization/"},{"title":"Secure your MCP server with OAuth 2.1: Step-by-step guide","url":"https://www.scalekit.com/blog/implement-oauth-for-mcp-servers"},{"title":"Securing Spring AI MCP servers with OAuth2","url":"https://spring.io/blog/2025/04/02/mcp-server-oauth2/"},{"title":"Example Securing AI Agent Access with OAuth in MCP","url":"https://stytch.com/blog/oauth-for-mcp-explained-with-a-real-world-example/"},{"title":"How to add OAuth to your MCP server — WorkOS","url":"https://workos.com/blog/how-to-add-authentication-to-your-mcp-server"},{"title":"MCP OAuth 2.1 - A Complete Guide - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/composiodev/mcp-oauth-21-a-complete-guide-3g91"},{"title":"Understanding OAuth2 and implementing identity-aware MCP servers | by Heeki Park | Medium","url":"https://heeki.medium.com/understanding-oauth2-and-implementing-identity-aware-mcp-servers-221a06b1a6cf"},{"title":"MCP Server oAuth: Implementation and Configuration","url":"https://www.cloudnativedeepdive.com/mcp-server-oauth-implementation-and-configuration/"},{"title":"Building an MCP server with OAuth and Cloudflare Workers","url":"https://stytch.com/blog/building-an-mcp-server-oauth-cloudflare-workers/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive overview of MCP server authentication OAuth configuration best practices:\n\n## Key Best Practices for MCP Server OAuth Configuration\n\n### Security Standards\n\nImplementations MUST follow OAuth 2.1 security best practices as laid out in OAuth 2.1 Section 7.

One year after launch, MCP has become the universal standard for connecting AI agents to enterprise tools—with 97M+ monthly SDK downloads.\n\n## Enterprise Integration & Infrastructure\n\nMiddleware, APIs, MCP and AI platforms that can plug into core systems (ERP, CRM, legacy databases) are critical, so AI outputs can flow into day-to-day workflows. However, 46% of respondents cite integration with existing systems as their primary challenge.\n\n## Security Concerns\n\nThere are significant security challenges emerging with rapid MCP adoption. According to one CTO, \"MCP's flexible architecture created a Wild West of potentially untrusted code, where community-published servers could be backdoored or abandoned\". One of the most significant challenges for enterprise MCP adoption is authentication and authorization, with enterprises expecting AI agent connections to flow through their existing identity providers.\n\n## Management Needs\n\nIf there will be a lot of active MCP servers in an organisation, then management of them will start to become more significant as more concerns appear. Since MCP has quickly become the accepted way agents interact with external tools, there will have to be more effort to keep the MCP servers under control.\n\n## Market Growth\n\nMCP, which saw broad adoption throughout 2025, standardizes how agents connect to external tools, databases, and APIs. Gartner predicts that 40% of enterprise applications will embed AI agents by the end of 2026, up from less than 5% in 2025.\n\n## Coding Assistant Trends\n\nBy the end of the year, coding tools had moved on from \"mere\" autocomplete functionality to full-on agentic coding.
