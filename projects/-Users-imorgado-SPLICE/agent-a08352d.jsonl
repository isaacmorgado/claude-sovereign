This significantly exceeded the previous best assisted system (Claude 2) of 4.80%. More recently, Claude Sonnet 4.5 increased planning performance for Devin by 18% and end-to-end eval scores by 12%.\n\n## **Claude Code Performance**\nClaude models have shown strong progression on SWE-bench benchmarks:\n\n- **Claude Sonnet 4.5**: Achieved 77.2% on the full 500-problem SWE-bench Verified dataset, representing state-of-the-art on the SWE-bench Verified evaluation\n- **Claude Opus 4.1**: Achieves 74.5% on SWE-bench Verified\n- **Claude 3.5 Sonnet**: Devlo and Globant Code Fix achieved 47.3% and 48.3% respectively, both relying solely on Claude 3.5 Sonnet\n\n## **Cursor Performance**\nWhile Cursor wasn't tested directly on SWE-bench as a standalone tool (it's an IDE that integrates various models), Cursor CEO Michael Truell calls Sonnet 4.5 \"state-of-the-art for coding\" with improvements in complex codebase understanding. Cursor AI supports multiple AI models including GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, Claude, and a custom 'cursor-small' model.\n\n## **Context**\nThe best-performing models, OpenAI GPT-5 and Claude Opus 4.1, score only 23.3% and 23.1% respectively on SWE-Bench Pro, showing that newer, more challenging benchmarks reveal different performance characteristics."],"durationSeconds":16.8639548330009}}

Each subagent might explore extensively using tens of thousands of tokens, but returns only a condensed, distilled summary of often 1,000-2,000 tokens.\n\nThis distributed approach prevents context overflow while preserving conversation coherence across extended interactions.\n\n### Performance Impact\nAnthropic's multi-agent research system outperformed a single-agent by 90.2% on internal research evaluations, with token usage explaining 80% of performance variance.\n\nBoth architectures benefit from external memory systems, structured note-taking, and progressive disclosure strategies to manage context limitations effectively.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4c2c2e4d-241c-45b4-bc8a-f7b609fe4dd3","timestamp":"2026-01-10T21:31:31.184Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"context window usage multi-agent vs single agent memory comparison","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Ux3tkWLDyAmneZ1QuL33kt","content":[{"title":"Effective context engineering for AI agents","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/effective-context-engineering-for-ai-agents"},{"title":"How to Build Multi Agent AI Systems With Context Engineering","url":"https://www.vellum.ai/blog/multi-agent-systems-building-with-context-engineering"},{"title":"How we built our multi-agent research system","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/multi-agent-research-system"},{"title":"Single vs Multi-Agent System?","url":"https://www.philschmid.de/single-vs-multi-agents"},{"title":"Architecting efficient context-aware multi-agent framework for production - Google Developers Blog","url":"https://developers.googleblog.com/en/architecting-efficient-context-aware-multi-agent-framework-for-production/"},{"title":"Memory Blocks: The Key to Agentic Context Management | Letta","url":"https://www.letta.com/blog/memory-blocks"},{"title":"Memory in multi-agent systems: technical implementations | by cauri | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/@cauri/memory-in-multi-agent-systems-technical-implementations-770494c0eca7"},{"title":"Memory in Agents, Make LLMs remember.","url":"https://www.philschmid.de/memory-in-agents"},{"title":"Amazon Bedrock AgentCore Memory: Building context-aware agents | Artificial Intelligence","url":"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/machine-learning/amazon-bedrock-agentcore-memory-building-context-aware-agents/"},{"title":"Context Window Management: Strategies for Long-Context AI Agents and Chatbots","url":"https://www.getmaxim.ai/articles/context-window-management-strategies-for-long-context-ai-agents-and-chatbots/"}]},"I found several relevant resources comparing context window usage and memory management between multi-agent and single-agent systems.

Each subagent might explore extensively using tens of thousands of tokens, but returns only a condensed, distilled summary of often 1,000-2,000 tokens.\n\nThis distributed approach prevents context overflow while preserving conversation coherence across extended interactions.\n\n### Performance Impact\nAnthropic's multi-agent research system outperformed a single-agent by 90.2% on internal research evaluations, with token usage explaining 80% of performance variance.\n\nBoth architectures benefit from external memory systems, structured note-taking, and progressive disclosure strategies to manage context limitations effectively."],"durationSeconds":19.536613375000655}}

Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution and achieving 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp while reducing agent execution steps by up to 35%.\n\n### Task Decomposition Approaches\n\nGraph-based approaches train agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies. Switching from sequential to parallel training approaches leads to consistent improvements across reasoning benchmarks, as sequential methods impose strong step-dependency priors that limit flexible task decomposition.\n\n### Performance Trade-offs\n\nMulti-agent systems suffer from inefficient tool utilization and prolonged execution times due to sequential processing, while both approaches face reasoning efficiency bottlenecks in complex scenarios.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e3edf3cc-6acc-4723-ae63-e27757c961c2","timestamp":"2026-01-10T21:31:52.488Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"task type\" agent performance sequential parallel reasoning decomposition","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01QmKRVSBuCNNpWscT9Xu9uj","content":[{"title":"Optimizing Sequential Multi-Step Tasks with Parallel LLM Agents","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2507.08944v1"},{"title":"Advancing Agentic Systems: Dynamic Task Decomposition ...","url":"https://openreview.net/pdf?id=kRRLhPp7CO"},{"title":"Native Parallel Reasoner: Reasoning in Parallelism via Self-Distilled Reinforcement Learning","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2512.07461"},{"title":"Flash-Searcher: Fast and Effective Web Agents via DAG-Based Parallel Execution","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2509.25301v1"},{"title":"Advancing Agentic Systems: Dynamic Task Decomposition, Tool Integration and Evaluation using Novel Metrics and Dataset","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2410.22457v1"},{"title":"TDAG: A multi-agent framework based on dynamic Task Decomposition and Agent Generation - ScienceDirect","url":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0893608025000796"},{"title":"GAP: Graph-based Agent Planning with Parallel Tool Use and Reinforcement Learning","url":"https://arxiv.org/html/2510.25320"},{"title":"2025-12-22 Native Parallel Reasoner: Reasoning in Parallelism via","url":"https://www.arxiv.org/pdf/2512.07461"},{"title":"Breaking Down Tasks: Master Task Decomposition for AI Agents - Interactive | Michael Brenndoerfer | Michael Brenndoerfer","url":"https://mbrenndoerfer.com/writing/breaking-down-tasks-task-decomposition-ai-agents"},{"title":"Parallel agents - Agent Development Kit","url":"https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/workflow-agents/parallel-agents/"}]},"I've performed the web search.

Flash-Searcher decomposes complex tasks into subtasks with explicit dependencies, enabling concurrent execution and achieving 67.7% accuracy on BrowseComp while reducing agent execution steps by up to 35%.\n\n### Task Decomposition Approaches\n\nGraph-based approaches train agent foundation models to decompose complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential dependencies. Switching from sequential to parallel training approaches leads to consistent improvements across reasoning benchmarks, as sequential methods impose strong step-dependency priors that limit flexible task decomposition.\n\n### Performance Trade-offs\n\nMulti-agent systems suffer from inefficient tool utilization and prolonged execution times due to sequential processing, while both approaches face reasoning efficiency bottlenecks in complex scenarios."],"durationSeconds":17.977193916000427}}

Now I have comprehensive research data. Let me compile this into a detailed report with all the numbers:\n\n---\n\n# DEEP RESEARCH: Multi-Agent vs Single-Agent Performance Benchmarks\n\n## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nMulti-agent systems show **conditional advantages** over single-agent approaches. They excel at parallelizable tasks but fail spectacularly on sequential work, and the performance gap is **narrowing as frontier LLMs improve**. Most critically: **parallel execution costs 26x more in tokens but delivers only 30-40% wall-clock speedup** due to parallelization, not better reasoning.\n\n---\n\n## 1. BENCHMARK SCORES: SWE-BENCH & CODING AGENTS\n\n### SWE-Bench Verified (Real Issue Resolution)\nState-of-the-art scores as of 2025:\n\n| Model/Agent | Score | Benchmark | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Claude Opus 4.5 + Live-SWE-agent | **79.2%** | SWE-Bench Verified | Current leader |\n| Gemini 3 Pro + Live-SWE-agent | **77.4%** | SWE-Bench Verified | Open-source scaffold |\n| Claude Opus 4.5 medium | **74.40%** | SWE-Bench Verified | Single-model baseline |\n| TRAE (multi-model ensemble) | **75.2%** | SWE-Bench Verified | Multi-agent combo |\n| Claude Sonnet 4.5 | **77.2%** | Full 500-problem dataset | Single model |\n\n### SWE-Bench Pro (Harder, Long-Horizon Tasks)\nScores drop dramatically:\n\n| Model/Agent | Score | Public Subset | Private Subset |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Claude Sonnet 4.5 + Live-SWE-agent | **45.8%** | SWE-Bench Pro | State-of-the-art |\n| Claude Opus 4.1 | 22.7% | - | 17.8% (private) |\n| OpenAI GPT-5 | 23.1% | - | 14.9% (private) |\n\n**Key insight**: All top 2025 submissions use multi-agent scaffolding, but single frontier models (Claude Opus 4.5) still achieve 74-79% on Verified tasks.\n\n### HumanEval (Synthetic Python Problems)\n- **Saturation reached**: 94%+ solved by top methods\n- Benchmark too easy for modern models—not representative of real engineering\n- Real-world code generation remains much harder\n\n### Devin AI (First Widely-Tested Agent)\n- **SWE-Bench score**: 13.86% (570 issues)\n- **Real-world success rate**: 15% (3 out of 20 tasks in user testing)\n- **Merged PR rate**: 67% (up from 34% YoY)\n\n---\n\n## 2. COST ANALYSIS: Multi-Agent Premium\n\n### Token Consumption Comparison\n\n**Single-agent baseline**: 28 input tokens + 15 output tokens  \n**Multi-agent (5 parallel agents)**: 1,005 input tokens + 153 output tokens  \n\n**Cost impact**:\n```\nSingle-agent task: $0.41/day per 10,000 queries\nMulti-agent (5-agent swarm): $10.54/day per 10,000 queries\nMultiply × 365 days:\n  Single-agent: $150/year\n  Multi-agent: $3,847/year\n  RATIO: 26x more expensive\n```\n\n**Real-world example** (Anthropic research):\n- Single GPT-4 call on complex query: $0.50\n- Five parallel agent calls: $3.00\n- **6x cost increase for 5 agents**\n\n### Token Usage Metrics\n- **Multi-agent systems use 15x more tokens than single-agent chat**\n- Token usage explained **80% of performance variance** in Anthropic's testing\n- High-performing agents (SWE-Bench, GAIA) use **10-50x more tokens** per task\n\n### Model Pricing (for context)\n- Claude 3 Haiku: $0.80/$4.00 per M tokens (input/output)\n- Claude 3.5 Sonnet: $3.00/$15.00 per M tokens\n- Claude 3 Opus: $15.00/$75.00 per M tokens\n\n---\n\n## 3. SPEED ANALYSIS: Wall-Clock Time Improvements\n\n### Parallelization Benefits (NOT Better Reasoning)\nReal-world measurements:\n\n| Task Type | Single-Agent Time | Multi-Agent Time | Improvement | Notes |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Content workflow (outline→draft→fact-check→polish) | 6:10 | 3:56 | **36%** | Parallel reduces I/O wait |\n| 5-brief processing | 30 min | 19 min | **37%** | Throughput improvement |\n| Research summarization (20 links, 4 shards) | ~2:00 | 1:40 | **22%** | Orchestrator overlap |\n\n**Critical caveat**: Speed improvements come from **overlapping I/O and compute**, NOT from agents reasoning faster. Each individual agent is not faster—they just run in parallel.\n\n### End-to-End Response Time\n- **Swarm architecture**: ~40% faster than supervisor\n  - Direct agent-to-agent communication\n  - Eliminates central routing bottleneck\n- **Supervisor architecture**: Routing calls = 30% of response time overhead\n\n---\n\n## 4. TASK TYPE PERFORMANCE: Where Swarms WIN vs LOSE\n\n### Multi-Agent WINS (Parallelizable Tasks)\n- **Financial reasoning/parallel tasks**: +80.9% improvement\n- **Dynamic web navigation**: +9.2% improvement\n- **Parallel tool usage**: Agents execute tools simultaneously\n- **Information exceeding single context window**: Distribute across agents\n\n### Multi-Agent LOSES (Sequential Tasks)\n- **Planning in Minecraft** (sequential dependencies): -39% to -70% performance drop\n- **Reasoning chains**: Sequential reasoning suffers; -35% drop observed (Claude in PlanCraft)\n- **Single-step verification**: One-shot questions perform better with single agent\n\n### Task Decomposition Reality\n- **Structural metrics** most important for sequential tasks\n- **Tool metrics** most important for parallel tasks\n- Poorly decomposed tasks (too granular, too broad, or non-serializable) cause agent misalignment\n\n---\n\n## 5. QUALITY METRICS: Code Quality Comparison\n\n### Multi-Agent Code Quality Advantages\n- **Accuracy**: 88% (multi-agent) vs 50% (single LLM) on human reasoning replication\n- **Correctness**: MultiAGENT systems produce complete strategies 90-95% of the time; single agents only 65%\n- **Strategy completeness**: Multi-agent advantage: 25-30 percentage points\n\n### Narrowing Gap (Critical Finding)\n- **2023**: Multi-agent +10% over single-agent\n- **2024-2025**: Multi-agent +3% over single-agent\n- **Reason**: Frontier LLMs (Claude Opus 4.5, GPT-5) have improved long-context reasoning, memory, and tool usage\n\n### Code Review Impact\n- **Critic patterns**: Reduce hallucinations, improve coherence\n- **Dual-agent (write + review)**: Improves quality significantly\n- **Proposal generation**: Introducing critic agent reduced manual editing\n\n### Caveat\nUsing same model in single-agent setup sometimes **outperforms** multi-agent version, indicating systemic coordination failures, not reasoning limitations.\n\n---\n\n## 6. DIMINISHING RETURNS: Number of Agents\n\n### The 5-Agent Sweet Spot\n- **1 agent**: Baseline\n- **2-5 agents**: Largest accuracy gains, reliable improvements\n- **5-10 agents**: Diminishing returns begin\n- **10+ agents**: Minimal gains, coordination overhead increases\n\n### Capability Saturation Effect (Critical)\n**When individual agents already achieve >45% success rate, adding more agents yields diminishing or negative returns.**\n\n### Coordination Overhead\n- Coordination accounts for **15-25% of total operational costs** in mature multi-agent systems\n- Each additional agent multiplies communication complexity\n- Bottlenecks emerge in agent-to-agent handoffs\n\n---\n\n## 7. FAILURE MODES: Why Multi-Agent Systems Fail\n\n### Production Failure Rates\n\n| System | Failure Rate | Context |\n|---|---|---|\n| ChatDev | 66.7% | Only 33.3% correctness |\n| AppWorld | 86.7% | Cross-app test failures |\n| HyperAgent | 74.7% | Problem resolution failures |\n| **Broader statistics** | **41-86.7%** | Multi-agent LLM systems in production |\n\n### 14 Identified Failure Modes (Grouped)\n\n**Specification & System Design (41.77%)**\n- Agents disobey task constraints (most frequent: 15.2%)\n- Planners assign non-serializable subtasks\n- Poorly decomposed tasks (too granular or too broad)\n\n**Inter-Agent Misalignment (36.94%)**\n- Agents ignore each other's input\n- Communication breakdowns\n- Withholding critical information between agents\n- Agents stuck in repetitive loops\n\n**Task Verification & Termination (31%)**\n- Incomplete verification checks (13.6%)\n- Outright incorrect verification despite task completion\n- Agents continue past completion\n\n### Root Cause Analysis\n- **Not primarily LLM limitations**: Same model in single-agent setup often outperforms\n- **System design failures**: Coordination, communication protocols, verification mechanisms\n- **Workflow orchestration**: Rigid or poorly defined task sequences\n\n---\n\n## 8. CONTEXT WINDOW & MEMORY USAGE\n\n### Single-Agent Architecture\n- Unified context with continuous history\n- All previous steps accessible to current step\n- **Problem**: Eventually exceeds useful context window; errors and forgotten details\n\n### Multi-Agent Architecture\n- Each agent has isolated context window\n- Subagents explore extensively (10,000s of tokens)\n- Return condensed summaries (1,000-2,000 tokens)\n- **Benefit**: Distributes work; prevents context overflow\n\n### Performance Impact of Distributed Context\n- **Anthropic's multi-agent system**: Outperformed single-agent by 90.2% on research tasks\n- Token usage explained **80% of performance variance**\n- External memory systems effective for both architectures\n\n---\n\n## 9. USER SATISFACTION & REAL-WORLD ADOPTION\n\n### 2025 Stack Overflow Developer Survey\n\n**Adoption rates:**\n- 23% use AI agents regularly (weekly)\n- 8% use infrequently\n- 52% don't use agents or use simpler tools\n- **Only 31% active agent users**\n\n**Perceived benefits** (among agent users):\n- 70% agree agents reduced time on specific tasks\n- 69% agree agents increased productivity\n- **BUT only 17%** agree agents improved team collaboration (lowest-rated metric)\n\n**Major concerns:**\n- 87% worried about accuracy\n- 81% concerned about privacy and security\n\n### Producer Satisfaction (Devin AI Case Study)\n**Successful use cases:**\n- Nubank: 20x cost savings on migration tasks\n- Large bank: 10x speedup on ETL migrations (3-4 hours vs 30-40 hours)\n- Security fixes: 20x efficiency (30 min vs 1.5 min per vulnerability)\n\n**Failure modes observed:**\n- Devin ignores PR feedback and claims fixes without delivering\n- Modifies unrelated code (drops safeguards, adds unnecessary declarations)\n- Requires clear, upfront requirements (struggles with ambiguous projects)\n- **Best suited to junior-level work**, not senior/architectural tasks\n\n---\n\n## 10. BROADER DEPLOYMENT STATISTICS\n\n### Enterprise AI Project Failure Rates\n\n| Timeframe | Failure Rate | Notes |\n|---|---|---|\n| 2024 | 70-85% | NTT DATA report |\n| 2025 | 90% | Agentic AI implementations |\n| 2025 (abandoned POCs) | 46% | Never reached production |\n| 2025 (stalled pilots) | 32% | Piloted but abandoned |\n| 2025 (companies abandoning AI) | 42% | Up from 17% in 2024 |\n\n### Technical Failure Statistics\n- **Google Gemini 2.5 Pro**: Failed 70% of real-world office tasks\n- **AI customer service bots**: 39% pulled/reworked due to errors (2024)\n- **Gartner prediction**: 40% of agentic AI projects will be canceled by 2027\n\n### Projected Market Despite Failures\n- 2024 market: $5.1 billion\n- 2030 projected: $47.1 billion (823% growth)\n- Paradox: High failure rates + rapid growth\n\n---\n\n## 11. ARCHITECTURE COMPARISON: Swarm vs Supervisor\n\n### Swarm Architecture Performance\n- **Response time**: ~40% faster than supervisor\n- **Token usage**: Lower; direct communication eliminates routing overhead\n- **Token breakdown**:\n  - Supervisor uses more tokens overall\n  - Routing calls = 30% of total response time\n- **Communication**: Direct agent-to-agent (reduces bottlenecks)\n\n### Supervisor Architecture\n- **Centralized control**: Simpler logic, predictable behavior\n- **Latency penalty**: Extra \"translation\" hop on every handoff\n- **Scalability**: Poor; bottleneck multiplies with task delegation\n\n### Verdict\n**Swarm slightly outperforms supervisor across the board**, but both architectures face coordination overhead that limits scalability beyond 5-10 agents.\n\n---\n\n## 12.
