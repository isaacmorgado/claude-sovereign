takes, removing silences, and accelerating video editing workflows.\n\n## Key Constraints\n- **CEP version**: Premiere Pro 14.0-25.9 (wider compatibility)\n- **UXP version**: Premiere Pro 25.6+ (modern architecture)\n- Use `127.0.0.1` not `localhost` in fetch URLs\n- Backend (prod): https://splice-api-production.up.railway.app\n- Backend (dev): https://127.0.0.1:3847\n\n## Current Status\n**v6.0.3** | ✅ SaaS Audit PASSED | ✅ All Audit Items Resolved | Production ready | 43/43 endpoints validated | OWASP Top 10 compliant\n\n### CEP Extension Verified Working (Dec 2025)\n- Panel loads in Premiere Pro 25.5.0 via Window > Extensions > SPLICE\n- Authentication with license keys functional\n- Credits display showing user balance\n- CSInterface communication with ExtendScript verified\n- QE DOM safety checks for all razor/track operations\n- Global state management via `window.spliceState`\n\n### Recent Fixes (v6.0.3 - Dec 2025)\n- **Security Hardening**: All critical env vars validated at startup (STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, JWT_SECRET, DATABASE_URL, OPENAI_API_KEY)\n- **Security Hardening**: Webhook secret validation in both backend and website (rejects unsigned in production)\n- **Pricing Consistency**: All website pages now show $15/$39/$129 (Starter/Pro/Team)\n- **Version Alignment**: All version numbers synchronized to 6.0.3 across all components\n- **CEP Compatibility**: Host Version changed to 14.0 for wider Premiere Pro support\n\n### Previous Fixes (v6.0.2)\n- **Core Analysis**: All endpoints use `wavPath` parameter correctly\n- **Music Module**: Element IDs standardized to kebab-case\n- **Text Editor**: Uses `buildSequenceFromCutList()` method\n- **JSX Host**: QE availability checks with `enableQE()` fallback\n- **Presets**: Correctly access `preset.settings.*` properties\n\n### Phase 6 Complete - License Key System\n- License key format: `SPLICE-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX`\n- `POST /license/activate` - Validate and activate license keys\n- `GET /license/key` - Get license by customer ID (requires auth header)\n- `POST /license/lookup` - Lookup by email (sends key via email for security)\n- Stripe webhook auto-generates keys on subscription\n- Plugin UI updated for license key input\n\n### Website Complete\n- Next.js 14 + Tailwind + Framer Motion\n- All UX psychology elements (social proof, scarcity, authority)\n- Stripe checkout integration\n- 26/26 E2E tests passing\n\n## Project Structure\n```\nsplice-backend/          # Node.js API server\n  server.js              # Main entry (3,700 LOC)\n  services/

preset = PRESETS[presetId];\nif (preset && preset.settings) {\n    const settings = preset.settings;\n    // Use settings.sensitivity, settings.enableJCut, etc.\n}\n```\n\n### Security: innerHTML XSS Prevention\nEach CEP module has its own `escapeHtml` function for XSS prevention:\n```javascript\n// Pattern used in all CEP modules\nfunction escapeHtml(str) {\n    if (!str) return '';\n    const div = document.createElement('div');\n    div.textContent = str;\n    return div.innerHTML;\n}\n\n// ALWAYS escape user-controllable data in innerHTML\nelement.innerHTML = `<span>${escapeHtml(userData)}</span>`;\n\n// For URLs, store via JS property instead of data attributes\nbutton._url = untrustedUrl;  // Safe\nbutton.dataset.url = untrustedUrl;  // Unsafe\n```\n\n##

(exits if missing) |\n| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | Billing | Yes (exits if missing) |\n| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Webhook signature verification | Yes (returns 500) |\n| `JWT_SECRET` | Authentication tokens | Yes (exits if missing/default) |\n| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL | Yes (exits if missing) |\n| `EMAIL_PROVIDER` | Email service: `sendgrid`, `ses`, `console` | No (defaults to console) |\n| `SENDGRID_API_KEY` | SendGrid API key for emails | No (required if EMAIL_PROVIDER=sendgrid) |\n| `AWS_SES_REGION` | AWS SES region (default: us-east-1) | No (required if EMAIL_PROVIDER=ses) |\n| `EMAIL_FROM` | Sender email address | No (defaults to noreply@splice.video) |\n| `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` | Vocal isolation | No |\n| `MUREKA_API_KEY` | Music generation | No |\n| `R2_*` | Cloudflare R2

},\n  \"segments\": [{\n    \"type\": \"speech|silence|best_take|take\",\n    \"inPoint\": 0.0,\n    \"outPoint\": 10.5,\n    \"takeNumber\": 1,\n    \"colorHint\": \"cerulean\"\n  }]\n}\n```\n\n## Preset Profiles\n| Preset | Sensitivity | Min Silence | Use Case |\n|--------|-------------|-------------|----------|\n| podcast | 35 | 0.8s | Conversational |\n| interview | 50 | 0.5s | Q&A rhythm |\n| reaction | 70 | 0.3s | Fast-paced |\n| tutorial | 30 | 1.0s | Teaching pace |\n| vlog | 65 | 0.35s | YouTube edits |\n\n## Key Features\n- Silence detection (RMS, FFprobe, Whisper)\n- Take detection and labeling\n- J-Cut/L-Cut support\n- Multitrack/multicam analysis\n- AI music generation (Mureka)\n- Caption export (SRT/VTT)\n- Vocal isolation (Replicate)\n- Chapter detection (GPT-4o-mini)\n- Social reframe (face tracking)\n- Text-based editing\n\n## CEP Development Conventions\n\n### Element IDs\n- Use **kebab-case** for all element IDs: `music-generate-btn`, `text-editor-content`\n- Cache elements in module-specific objects: `musicElements`, `textEditorElements`\n\n### Global State\n```javascript\nwindow.spliceState = {\n    lastTranscript: null,\n    currentVideoPath: null,\n    activeSequence: null,\n    audioPath: null\n};\nwindow.currentTranscript = null;\n```\n\n### JSX/ExtendScript Patterns\n```javascript\n// Always check QE availability before using QE DOM\nif (!isQEAvailable() && !enableQE()) {\n    return JSON.stringify({ error: \"QE not available\" });\n}\n\n// Return JSON for all results\nreturn JSON.stringify({ success: true, data: result });\n```\n\n### API Request Parameters\n| Endpoint | Required Params |\n|----------|-----------------|\n| `/analyze` | `wavPath`, `detectTakes` |\n| `/silences-rms` | `wavPath`, `sensitivity`, `minSilenceLength` |\n| `/chapters` | `wavPath`, `transcript` |\n| `/cut-list` | `sourceName`, `sourcePath`, `duration`, `silences` |\n\n### Preset Access Pattern\n```javascript\nconst preset = PRESETS[presetId];\nif (preset && preset.settings) {\n    const settings = preset.settings;\n    // Use settings.sensitivity, settings.enableJCut, etc.\n}\n```\n\n### Security: innerHTML XSS Prevention\nEach CEP module has its own `escapeHtml` function for XSS prevention:\n```javascript\n// Pattern used in all CEP modules\nfunction escapeHtml(str) {\n    if (!str) return '';\n    const div = document.createElement('div');\n    div.textContent = str;\n    return div.innerHTML;\n}\n\n// ALWAYS escape user-controllable data in innerHTML\nelement.innerHTML = `<span>${escapeHtml(userData)}</span>`;\n\n// For URLs, store via JS property instead of data attributes\nbutton._url = untrustedUrl;  // Safe\nbutton.dataset.url = untrustedUrl;  // Unsafe\n```\n\n##

(GPT-4o-mini)\n- Social reframe (face tracking)\n- Text-based editing\n\n## CEP Development Conventions\n\n### Element IDs\n- Use **kebab-case** for all element IDs: `music-generate-btn`, `text-editor-content`\n- Cache elements in module-specific objects: `musicElements`, `textEditorElements`\n\n### Global State\n```javascript\nwindow.spliceState = {\n    lastTranscript: null,\n    currentVideoPath: null,\n    activeSequence: null,\n    audioPath: null\n};\nwindow.currentTranscript = null;\n```\n\n### JSX/ExtendScript Patterns\n```javascript\n// Always check QE availability before using QE DOM\nif (!isQEAvailable() && !enableQE()) {\n    return JSON.stringify({ error: \"QE not available\" });\n}\n\n// Return JSON for all results\nreturn JSON.stringify({ success: true, data: result });\n```\n\n### API Request Parameters\n| Endpoint | Required Params |\n|----------|-----------------|\n| `/analyze` | `wavPath`, `detectTakes` |\n| `/silences-rms` | `wavPath`, `sensitivity`, `minSilenceLength` |\n| `/chapters` | `wavPath`, `transcript` |\n| `/cut-list` | `sourceName`, `sourcePath`, `duration`, `silences` |\n\n### Preset Access Pattern\n```javascript\nconst preset = PRESETS[presetId];\nif (preset && preset.settings) {\n    const settings = preset.settings;\n    // Use settings.sensitivity, settings.enableJCut, etc.\n}\n```\n\n### Security: innerHTML XSS Prevention\nEach CEP module has its own `escapeHtml` function for XSS prevention:\n```javascript\n// Pattern used in all CEP modules\nfunction escapeHtml(str) {\n    if (!str) return '';\n    const div = document.createElement('div');\n    div.textContent = str;\n    return div.innerHTML;\n}\n\n// ALWAYS escape user-controllable data in innerHTML\nelement.innerHTML = `<span>${escapeHtml(userData)}</span>`;\n\n// For URLs, store via JS property instead of data attributes\nbutton._url = untrustedUrl;  // Safe\nbutton.dataset.url = untrustedUrl;  // Unsafe\n```\n\n##
