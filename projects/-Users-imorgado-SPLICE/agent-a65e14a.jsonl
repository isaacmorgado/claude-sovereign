I have access to the project structure across three main directories:\n   - `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-backend` (Node.js/Express API)\n   - `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/splice-website` (Next.js frontend)\n   - `/Users/imorgado/SPLICE/video-generator` (Video processing utilities)\n\n3. I should use efficient search strategies:\n   - **Glob patterns** for finding files by name/extension\n   - **Grep with regex** for searching file contents\n   - **Read** for analyzing specific files\n   - **Bash** only for read-only operations\n\n4. I should return absolute file paths and code snippets in my final response\n5. I'm familiar with the project architecture, security implementations, and recent changes documented in CLAUDE.md\n\nI'm prepared to help you search for specific code patterns, navigate the codebase, find implementations, trace dependencies, or investigate any aspect of the SPLICE project.
