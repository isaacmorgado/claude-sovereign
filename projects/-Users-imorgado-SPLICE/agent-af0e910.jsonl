on my research, I have compiled the findings on FireCut's referral system and an implementation plan for SPLICE.\n\n---\n\n## FireCut Referral System Research\n\n### How FireCut's Referral System Works\n\n**Two-Tier System:**\n1. **Personal Referral Codes** - Available to paying customers\n   - Eligibility: After first payment is made\n   - Access: \"Refer a friend\" button appears in user dashboard\n   - Users receive an email notification when they become eligible\n\n2. **Affiliate Program** - For creators/influencers\n   - Application required via form\n   - Applicants can request a preferred code (max 8 characters)\n   - Requires audience reach method (YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, Newsletter, Blog)\n   - Provides \"lifetime commission on every referral\"\n\n### Benefits Structure (Based on available data)\n\n| Party | Typical Benefit |\n|-------|-----------------|\n| Referee (new user) | 10% discount on first purchase |\n| Referrer (affiliate) | Lifetime recurring commission (rate undisclosed, industry standard: 10-30%) |\n\n**Evidence from promo codes:**\n- Partner codes like `GAL`, `ASHAR10`, `ENGER`, `PETAR` all provide 10% OFF\n- This suggests the standard referee discount is 10%\n\n### Code Format\n\nBased on observed codes:\n- Short alphanumeric (3-8 characters)\n- Often creator/brand names: `GAL`, `ETHAN`, `ENGER`, `PETAR`\n- Or descriptive: `SAVE30`, `FLASH30`, `SUMMER`\n\n---\n\n## SPLICE Referral System Implementation Plan\n\n### Database Schema\n\n```sql\n-- Add to existing PostgreSQL schema\n\n-- Referral codes table\nCREATE TABLE
