Slider values are continuous by default, but may be discrete if desired (using the step attribute).\n\nExample usage from the documentation:\n```html\n<input type=\"range\" min=0 max=100 value=50 />\n```\n\nHowever, there's a known limitation: Sliders do not receive keyboard or pointer events.\n\n### 2.

Use px, or CSS styles.(no content)You can use CSS media queries with sliders, for example: `@media screen and (max-width: 260px) { input[type=range] { display: none; } }` - this CSS will hide sliders whenever the plugin's viewport width is less than 260px.\n\n### Key Known Issues\n- HTML5 input validation is not supported.\n- At the moment you're free to use HTML native \"form\" elements like `<select>`, `<textarea>`, `<input>` etc. They're decently styled, but be aware that in the long run those HTML native elements will be deprecated in favor of their Spectrum UXP widgets counterparts.\n\nFor best compatibility and future-proofing, using `sp-slider` (Spectrum UXP slider) is recommended over the native `<input type=\"range\">`.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"bd05a10a-470b-4b31-9bb9-9ede026b803c","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:36:50.930Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP slider CSS working range input","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01HUxJ4wSFgZTaBK6BokZAP2","content":[{"title":"Adobe","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/known-issues/"},{"title":"UXP 2 to 3 · Adobe XD Plugin Reference","url":"https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/migrations/uxp-2-to-3.html"},{"title":"Question about Spectrum CSS \"Slider Range\" Component - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/question-about-spectrum-css-slider-range-component/2275"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #1 Rundown on the UXP announcement | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/adobe-uxp-things-you-need-to-know"},{"title":"uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/ui-kitchen-sink/index.html at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/blob/main/ui-kitchen-sink/index.html"},{"title":"Code Samples—UXP for Adobe Photoshop","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/code_samples/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #9 Adobe Spectrum | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/Adobe-UXP-things-you-need-to-know-9-Adobe-Spectrum-UXP.html"},{"title":"Sliders · Adobe XD Plugin Reference","url":"https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/reference/ui/elements/sliders.html"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #2 Documentation | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/adobe-uxp-things-you-need-to-know-2-documentation"},{"title":"Range select slider - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/range-select-slider/1120"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about Adobe UXP slider and CSS range input:\n\n## Slider Options in Adobe UXP\n\nThere are two main approaches to implementing sliders in UXP:\n\n### 1.

Adobe recommends using Spectrum-based controls wherever possible for UI consistency. UXP offers a ready-made Spectrum-styled UI library.(no content)While exploring importing a stylesheet or making tweaks, you should keep in mind that UXP is not a browser. Its architecture does not (and will not) support all CSS properties. For example, UXP cannot support grid layout innately. The ones that are supported are listed in the API reference docs.(no content)In plugins, you have a lot more flexibility to manage CSS styling. You can add it via CSS classes or use inline styling or add it via JavaScript.\n\n### sp-slider Component\nThe sp-slider fills one side of the slider track, with the side specified via fill-offset. You can specify a custom unit for the slider value (such as \"%\"), and you can hide the slider value.\n\n### Styling Challenges with Spectrum Components\nThere's a question about whether there's a way to style elements of SP-SLIDER, SP-PICKER and SP-SWITCH with CSS. For example, changing the color of handler in slider or the highlight color for SP-PICKER (which is blue by default).\n\n### Spectrum vs Native Elements\nYou can use native elements, but they're not very fancy looking. For instance, the native range slider is available, but the Spectrum slider is \"kind of nicer.\" You should use Spectrum components where possible because this will keep the look consistent and Adobe keeps refining those components.\n\n### Web Components and Shadow DOM\nSpectrum Web Components are Web Components that follow the Spectrum specs. Generally speaking, a web component is a reusable custom HTML element that encapsulates a Shadow DOM (a hidden DOM tree that is rendered separately from the Document's DOM tree) with its own set of styles and behavior.\n\n### Example Usage\nAn example of sp-slider usage: `<sp-slider min=\"0\" max=\"100\" value=\"50\" disabled><sp-label slot=\"label\">Slider Label - Disabled</sp-label></sp-slider>`\n\n### CSS Preprocessors\nUXP understands pure CSS only. Using CSS preprocessors such as SASS or SCSS is possible, provided you transpile your code to a CSS stylesheet before using it.\n\nThe forum discussion at Creative Cloud Developer Forums suggests that styling sp-slider components with custom CSS (like changing handler colors) may be limited due to the Shadow DOM encapsulation of these Spectrum web components.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"f457da4d-c1be-45bc-a8f4-98b7ac7f9bbc","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:37:36.640Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"sp-slider UXP CSS styling custom range input Premiere Pro plugin","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01CBPuRXh2Hb7L8j3B8Ljk4X","content":[{"title":"CSS styling","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/recipes/css-styling/"},{"title":"Question about Spectrum CSS \"Slider Range\" Component - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/question-about-spectrum-css-slider-range-component/2275"},{"title":"Style SP-SLIDER, SP-PICKER and SP-SWITCH with CSS - UXP Plugin API - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/style-sp-slider-sp-picker-and-sp-switch-with-css/4271"},{"title":"Building your first UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/"},{"title":"sp-slider","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/uxp/reference-spectrum/User%20Interface/sp-slider/"},{"title":"Creating a custom CSS range slider with JavaScript upgrades - LogRocket Blog","url":"https://blog.logrocket.com/creating-custom-css-range-slider-javascript-upgrades/"},{"title":"uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/ui-kitchen-sink/index.html at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/blob/main/ui-kitchen-sink/index.html"},{"title":"37 CSS Range Slider Examples | FreeFrontend","url":"https://freefrontend.com/css-range-sliders/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #9 Adobe Spectrum | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/adobe-uxp-things-you-need-to-know-9-adobe-spectrum-uxp"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #1 Rundown on the UXP announcement | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/adobe-uxp-things-you-need-to-know"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about sp-slider UXP CSS styling for custom range input in Premiere Pro plugins:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### CSS Styling in UXP\nSpectrum is Adobe's design system, used across multiple applications.

Its architecture does not (and will not) support all the CSS properties. For example, UXP cannot support grid layout innately.(no content)CSS properties, Browser API or HTML elements must be willingly implemented by the UXP team, and priorities must be given. So for instance we've got CSS FlexBox, but not CSS Grids yet.\n\n## Pseudo-elements Support\n\nUXP supports pseudo-elements including `::after`, `::before`, and `::width`.(no content)UXP also supports `pointer-events: none` CSS property and pseudoElement in the `getComputedStyle(element, pseudoElement)` API.(no content)Added support for `:first-child` and `:not(:first-child)` pseudo-classes to enhance the existing Web Component support, and support for the `linear-gradient` property with start and end values.\n\n## Slider and updateUI\n\nIf you are looking to refresh the Layers panel while dragging a slider handle, try `updateUI()`.\n\n## CSS Variables and Additional Features\n\nUXP 3.1 supports CSS variables, additional units, calc, limited Media Queries, !important, and more.(no content)The easiest way to make your plugin theme-aware is to make use of CSS variables. Photoshop exposes a number of theme-specific CSS variables that are perfect for making your plugin respond to the user's theme color choice.\n\n## CSS Reference Documentation\n\nThe UXP documentation includes CSS reference covering general variables, units, the \"calc\" function, selectors, media queries, pseudo elements, pseudo classes, and styles.(no content)The CSS Reference provides technical documentation regarding the kinds of CSS styles and features available in UXP.\n\nFor the complete list of supported CSS properties and pseudo-elements, you can visit the official Adobe UXP documentation at developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"6e474317-f326-4a9e-a004-199d51e7e133","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:38:53.245Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Adobe UXP CSS supported properties pseudo-elements slider","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_018UPcgHugeJkghu9emC4eVr","content":[{"title":"Adobe","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/uxp/reference-css/Pseudo-classes/root/"},{"title":"CSS styling","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/recipes/css-styling/"},{"title":"Pseudo-elements","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-css/Pseudo-elements/"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #9 Adobe Spectrum | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/adobe-uxp-things-you-need-to-know-9-adobe-spectrum-uxp"},{"title":"API Changelog","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/ps_reference/changelog/"},{"title":"UXP 2 to 3 · Adobe XD Plugin Reference","url":"https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/migrations/uxp-2-to-3.html"},{"title":"Adobe UXP: Things you need to know! #2 Documentation | Davide Barranca — Photoshop, etc.","url":"https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/adobe-uxp-things-you-need-to-know-2-documentation"},{"title":"Documentation-UXP for Adobe Photoshop","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2021/"},{"title":"Making your Plugin Theme-aware","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/theme-awareness/"},{"title":"UXP API Reference","url":"https://adobedocs.github.io/uxp-photoshop/uxp-api/"}]},"Here's what I found about Adobe UXP CSS supported properties, pseudo-elements, and slider:\n\n## UXP CSS Support Overview\n\nWhile you are exploring importing a stylesheet or making tweaks, you should keep in mind that UXP is not a browser.

So for instance we've got CSS FlexBox, but not CSS Grids yet.\n\n## Pseudo-elements Support\n\nUXP supports pseudo-elements including `::after`, `::before`, and `::width`.(no content)UXP also supports `pointer-events: none` CSS property and pseudoElement in the `getComputedStyle(element, pseudoElement)` API.(no content)Added support for `:first-child` and `:not(:first-child)` pseudo-classes to enhance the existing Web Component support, and support for the `linear-gradient` property with start and end values.\n\n## Slider and updateUI\n\nIf you are looking to refresh the Layers panel while dragging a slider handle, try `updateUI()`.\n\n## CSS Variables and Additional Features\n\nUXP 3.1 supports CSS variables, additional units, calc, limited Media Queries, !important, and more.(no content)The easiest way to make your plugin theme-aware is to make use of CSS variables. Photoshop exposes a number of theme-specific CSS variables that are perfect for making your plugin respond to the user's theme color choice.\n\n## CSS Reference Documentation\n\nThe UXP documentation includes CSS reference covering general variables, units, the \"calc\" function, selectors, media queries, pseudo elements, pseudo classes, and styles.(no content)The CSS Reference provides technical documentation regarding the kinds of CSS styles and features available in UXP.\n\nFor the complete list of supported CSS properties and pseudo-elements, you can visit the official Adobe UXP documentation at developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/."],"durationSeconds":22.67707874999987}}

The `::-webkit-slider-thumb` and `::-webkit-slider-runnable-track` pseudo-elements are **NOT supported** in UXP.\n\n2. **Limited CSS**: UXP is not a browser and does not support all CSS properties. Custom styling of native range inputs via WebKit pseudo-elements will not work.\n\n3. **Event Timing**: The `change` event only fires on mouse up. The `input` event may fire during drag but has inconsistent support.\n\n4. **Spectrum Components Cannot Be Styled**: The `sp-slider` uses Shadow DOM, so custom CSS styling of the thumb or track colors is not possible through regular CSS.\n\n---\n\n### Workaround for Real-Time Updates During Drag\n\nIf you need real-time updates while dragging (for Photoshop specifically):\n\n```javascript\n// Use input event with specific BatchPlay options\ndocument.querySelector(\"#mySlider\").addEventListener(\"input\", async function(e) {\n  await batchPlay([\n    {\n      // your action here\n    }\n  ], {\n    \"synchronousExecution\": true,\n    \"modalBehavior\": \"execute\",\n    \"paintOptions\": {\n      \"immediateUpdate\": true,\n      \"quality\": \"draft\"\n    }\n  });\n});\n```\n\n---\n\n### Recommendation for Premiere Pro UXP\n\nSince custom CSS styling of slider thumbs/tracks is not supported in UXP, use the **sp-slider with variant=\"filled\"** for the best native appearance:\n\n```html\n<sp-slider id=\"thresholdSlider\" min=\"-60\" max=\"0\" value=\"-30\" variant=\"filled\">\n  <sp-label slot=\"label\">Silence Threshold (dB)</sp-label>\n</sp-slider>\n\n<script>\n  document.querySelector(\"#thresholdSlider\").addEventListener(\"change\", (e) => {\n    const threshold = e.target.value;\n    // Use the value\n  });\n</script>\n```\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Adobe UXP Sliders Documentation (XD)](https://adobexdplatform.com/plugin-docs/reference/ui/elements/sliders.html)\n- [Adobe UXP sp-slider Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/xd/uxp/uxp/reference-spectrum/User%20Interface/sp-slider/)\n- [UXP Photoshop Plugin Samples - UI Kitchen Sink](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-photoshop-plugin-samples/blob/main/ui-kitchen-sink/index.html)\n- [Adobe UXP CSS Styling Guide](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/recipes/css-styling/)\n- [UXP Slider Change on Move - Forum Discussion](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-slider-change-on-move/2701)\n- [Adobe UXP Pseudo-elements Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/uxp-api/reference-css/Pseudo-elements/)\n- [Adobe UXP: Things You Need to Know - Spectrum](https://www.davidebarranca.com/development/Adobe-UXP-things-you-need-to-know-9-Adobe-Spectrum-UXP.html)\n- [Style Input Type Range - Brenna O'Brien](https://brennaobrien.com/blog/2014/05/style-input-type-range-in-every-browser.html)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":590,"cache_read_input_tokens":23626,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":590,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGcTJXhNCaQxeiU1j2Eu","type":"assistant","uuid":"305cf730-a29b-45ef-a00f-40b4456ff187","timestamp":"2025-12-19T19:39:38.624Z"}
