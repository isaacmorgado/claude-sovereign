Both use the same models (Sonnet 4.5, Opus, Haiku) and authentication, but provide different workflows.\n\n### Claude Code CLI Advantages\nCLI excels at context control through message editing that rewinds both conversation and code state, plus keyboard-driven workflows that eliminate mouse dependency.\n\nKey CLI features include:\n- Context rewind - Double-ESC lets you edit any previous message and rewind code to that exact state, creating branches that rescue stuck sessions without starting over. The terminal UI has been refined over longer development, and runs as a lightweight terminal process using less memory and CPU than VS Code.\n- Experienced terminal users prefer CLI's context control, keyboard efficiency, and lightweight resource footprint.\n\n### VS Code Extension Advantages\nThe VS Code extension provides a native graphical interface for Claude Code, integrated directly into your IDE. This is the recommended way to use Claude Code in VS Code.\n\nKey extension features include:\n- Visual development feedback - Sidebar displays conversation history and shows file changes with inline diffs as Claude writes code. Plan mode with editing allows you to review Claude's proposed changes and edit the plan directly before accepting.\n- Beginner-friendly onboarding - Visual interface with clickable buttons and clear status indicators removes command-line intimidation for developers new to AI tools. Beginners consistently report higher success rates and faster onboarding with the Extension's visual interface.\n- You can see Claude's changes in real-time through a dedicated sidebar panel with inline diffs. The extension provides a richer, graphical Claude Code experience for users who prefer to work in IDEs over terminals.\n\n### Feature Parity Considerations\nCurrently, the Claude Code VS Code extension lacks feature parity with the CLI version, particularly missing essential commands that are available in the command-line interface. This creates an inconsistent experience between the two environments.\n\n### Shared Settings\nClaude Code settings (~/.claude/settings.json) are shared between the VS Code extension and the CLI. Use this file for allowed commands and directories, environment variables, hooks, and MCP servers.\n\n### Recommendations\n- CLI for terminal workflows and context control. Extension for visual development and beginner-friendly interface. Use both strategically based on task requirements.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"7a41652e-0604-4a52-b2c7-28de83ce4bb0","timestamp":"2026-01-10T16:01:10.241Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"Claude Code\" CLI vs \"VS Code\" AI extension comparison","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_018cqS31ahHKXzpRvE7rxqyu","content":[{"title":"Claude Code CLI vs VS Code Extension: Which Should You Use? | ClaudeLog","url":"https://claudelog.com/faqs/claude-code-cli-vs-vscode-extension-comparison/"},{"title":"Use Claude Code in VS Code - Claude Code Docs","url":"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/vs-code"},{"title":"CLI vs Extension for Claude Code and Codex: Two Ways to Use AI Coding Agents","url":"https://creativeworkflowlab.substack.com/p/claude-code-codex-cli-vs-cursor-vscode-extension"},{"title":"Claude Code VS Code extension: A complete guide in 2025","url":"https://www.eesel.ai/blog/claude-code-vs-code-extension"},{"title":"Claude Dev vs Claude Code: Which is Better for VS Code Users? - DEV Community","url":"https://dev.to/mechcloud_academy/claude-dev-vs-claude-code-which-is-better-for-vs-code-users-6el"},{"title":"[FEATURE] Implement all CLI commands in Claude Code VS Code Extension + /rewind priority · Issue #9119 · anthropics/claude-code","url":"https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9119"},{"title":"Enabling Claude Code to work more autonomously","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/news/enabling-claude-code-to-work-more-autonomously"},{"title":"Claude Code for VS Code - Visual Studio Marketplace","url":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anthropic.claude-code"},{"title":"GitHub Copilot CLI vs Claude code: Which is more suitable for you? - CometAPI - All AI Models in One API","url":"https://www.cometapi.com/github-copilot-cli-vs-claude-code/"},{"title":"Azad Coder (GPT 5 & Claude) - Visual Studio Marketplace","url":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=kodu-ai.claude-dev-experimental"}]},"Based on my search, here's a comparison between Claude Code CLI and VS Code AI extensions:\n\n## Claude Code CLI vs VS Code Extension Comparison\n\n### Overview\nAnthropic offers Claude Code in two forms: terminal CLI and VS Code extension.

You use it mostly through your terminal, like a command-line interface (CLI) tool. It works as a super-smart command you can run to analyze your code, make changes, run tests, and even push to GitHub. It's directly tied to the latest Claude models.(no content)Roo Code is the open-source alternative that lives right inside your VS Code editor. It started as a fork of another tool called Cline and has evolved into a full-blown AI agent that can read and write files, run terminal commands, and browse the web. Roo is \"model-agnostic\" – you \"bring your own key\" (BYOK) and can plug in whatever AI model you want – GPT-4, Gemini, and even Claude.\n\n## Key Differences\n\n| Feature | Claude Code | Roo Code |\n|---------|-------------|----------|\n| Interface | Terminal-based assistant tied to the Claude ecosystem | Flexible, in-IDE agent that lets you choose your AI brain |\n| Model Support | Claude models only | Compatible with any OpenAI-compatible or custom models and APIs |\n| Source | Proprietary (Anthropic) | Completely free and open-source |\n| Environment | Terminal/CLI | VS Code extension |\n\n## Features\n\n**Claude Code:**\n- Can onboard new developers by mapping entire repositories, explaining architectures, and summarizing dependencies within seconds. It also automates tedious workflows—such as issue triage, refactoring, testing, and PR submission—by turning them into single-command actions.\n\n**Roo Code:**\n- Offers a variety of customizable modes, such as Code Mode for routine coding tasks, Architect Mode for designing systems, Ask Mode for posing questions, Debug Mode for resolving issues, and user-defined Custom Modes tailored for specific tasks.\n- Has mode switching where you can plan in Architect mode, make it perfect, and then it will switch automatically to Code mode and start executing the task.\n\n## Pricing\n\n**Claude Code:**\n- Pro costs $17 per month when billed annually, or $20 monthly. Team plans start at $25 per person monthly for standard seats, while premium seats with Claude Code access cost $150 per person monthly.\n- Claude Max costs $100/month for heavy usage with no rate limits.\n\n**Roo Code:**\n- Follows a flexible pricing approach. The extension itself is completely free and open-source with no subscription fees. The Cloud Free plan includes token usage tracking and community support.\n- Pro costs $20 per month plus $5 per hour for cloud tasks, adding features like cloud agents. You only pay for the AI API calls you make to providers like OpenAI or Claude based on their pricing.\n\n## User Perspectives\n\nClaude Code has an edge in performance, especially since there's no rate limiting.

You use it mostly through your terminal, like a command-line interface (CLI) tool. It works as a super-smart command you can run to analyze your code, make changes, run tests, and even push to GitHub. It's directly tied to the latest Claude models.(no content)Roo Code is the open-source alternative that lives right inside your VS Code editor. It started as a fork of another tool called Cline and has evolved into a full-blown AI agent that can read and write files, run terminal commands, and browse the web. Roo is \"model-agnostic\" – you \"bring your own key\" (BYOK) and can plug in whatever AI model you want – GPT-4, Gemini, and even Claude.\n\n## Key Differences\n\n| Feature | Claude Code | Roo Code |\n|---------|-------------|----------|\n| Interface | Terminal-based assistant tied to the Claude ecosystem | Flexible, in-IDE agent that lets you choose your AI brain |\n| Model Support | Claude models only | Compatible with any OpenAI-compatible or custom models and APIs |\n| Source | Proprietary (Anthropic) | Completely free and open-source |\n| Environment | Terminal/CLI | VS Code extension |\n\n## Features\n\n**Claude Code:**\n- Can onboard new developers by mapping entire repositories, explaining architectures, and summarizing dependencies within seconds. It also automates tedious workflows—such as issue triage, refactoring, testing, and PR submission—by turning them into single-command actions.\n\n**Roo Code:**\n- Offers a variety of customizable modes, such as Code Mode for routine coding tasks, Architect Mode for designing systems, Ask Mode for posing questions, Debug Mode for resolving issues, and user-defined Custom Modes tailored for specific tasks.\n- Has mode switching where you can plan in Architect mode, make it perfect, and then it will switch automatically to Code mode and start executing the task.\n\n## Pricing\n\n**Claude Code:**\n- Pro costs $17 per month when billed annually, or $20 monthly. Team plans start at $25 per person monthly for standard seats, while premium seats with Claude Code access cost $150 per person monthly.\n- Claude Max costs $100/month for heavy usage with no rate limits.\n\n**Roo Code:**\n- Follows a flexible pricing approach. The extension itself is completely free and open-source with no subscription fees. The Cloud Free plan includes token usage tracking and community support.\n- Pro costs $20 per month plus $5 per hour for cloud tasks, adding features like cloud agents. You only pay for the AI API calls you make to providers like OpenAI or Claude based on their pricing.\n\n## User Perspectives\n\nClaude Code has an edge in performance, especially since there's no rate limiting. But Roo offers more control and a better coding experience overall. If you want something that tackles everything in one go, Claude Code is the route to take, but if you prefer customization, Roo might be your best bet.(no content)Claude Code feels really powerful, but it does need some set-up—especially on Windows since you'll have to use WSL. Once you get past the learning curve, it shines, but Roo offers a good balance for those who want a smoother experience with more stability.(no content)While Claude Code is a nice agent, some developers prefer being able to simply drag files, tag files, see what was edited, and accept changes through a UI."],"durationSeconds":30.951382249996065}}

Small bugs, typo corrections, simple refactors - Cursor handles these faster because you're already in your editor.\n\n### Claude Code's Strengths\nClaude Code is positioning itself as an \"Engineering Agent.\" The focus on git safety, clarifying questions, and deep reasoning suggests it's built for maintainability and complex refactoring tasks that require a \"senior engineer\" level of thought, rather than just speed.(no content)\"Cursor makes you faster at what you already know how to do. It's an accelerator. You're still driving. Claude Code does things for you. It's a delegator. You assign tasks, they get done.\"\n\n### Context Window Issues\nDespite the 200k token claim, developers have reported on Cursor's community forum that usable context often falls short, sometimes limited to 70k–120k tokens in practice. This is likely due to internal truncation, performance safeguards, or cost controls applied silently during execution.(no content)Claude Code's 200K context actually delivers. When you're working on a large codebase and need the AI to understand how your authentication system connects to your API routes connects to your database schema - that context matters.\n\n### Community Consensus\nThe thread debates whether developers should stick with Cursor or switch to Claude Code, with a loose consensus emerging: Claude Code often delivers higher-quality, first-try results, but Cursor excels for IDE-native control, visibility, and cost efficiency.(no content)One highly upvoted Reddit comment stated: \"Claude Code can build context, spin up subagents, and just plain think a lot more than Cursor will ever be able to for a reasonable cost.\" From r/cursor itself: \"Cursor is AT BEST 20-30% as good as Claude Code.\"\n\n### Practical Advice\nYou don't have to choose. Install the Claude Code CLI inside the Cursor terminal. Use Cursor for the UI and flow, and summon Claude when you need a senior engineer to solve a hard problem.(no content)One developer noted: \"For me, that means using Cursor for probably 80% of my work now. The things where I need Claude's extra capability are real, but they're not as frequent as I thought they'd be when I first made the switch. The key insight from all of this: don't get too attached to any single tool.\"\n\n### Pricing Consideration\nCursor costs $20/month. Claude Code Max costs $100-200/month. That's a 5-10x price difference. However, Claude Pro includes \"unlimited\" usage of Claude Code for $20/month. It is limited, because you are rate limited. But some users report they haven't hit a rate limit yet.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"09ed6b45-3144-4b9c-a443-9a84a066ee63","timestamp":"2026-01-10T16:01:53.129Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"switching from Cursor to Claude Code\" experience Reddit 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_012pkt5rdUGJi8sfTumgrScy","content":[{"title":"Claude Code vs Cursor: Deep Comparison for Dev Teams [2025] - Qodo","url":"https://www.qodo.ai/blog/claude-code-vs-cursor/"},{"title":"Claude Code 2.0.71 vs. Cursor AI: 2025 Comparison of Best AI Coding Agents","url":"https://vertu.com/lifestyle/claude-code-2-0-71-vs-cursor-the-2025-ai-coding-showdown/"},{"title":"Claude Code vs Cursor: The honest comparison every ... - Cyrus","url":"https://www.atcyrus.com/stories/claude-code-vs-cursor-comparison-2026"},{"title":"I tested Cursor vs Claude Code: One took 2 minutes, the other took 24 | by Chris Dunlop | Realworld AI Use Cases | Nov, 2025 | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/realworld-ai-use-cases/i-tested-cursor-vs-claude-code-one-took-2-minutes-the-other-took-24-0b0614484f34"},{"title":"Cursor CLI vs Claude Code: Why I Switched Back","url":"https://www.ksred.com/why-im-back-using-cursor-and-why-their-cli-changes-everything/"},{"title":"Cursor or Claude Code? : Cursor Discussion Forums | Product Hunt","url":"https://www.producthunt.com/p/cursor/cursor-or-claude-code"},{"title":"Cursor vs Claude Code: The Ultimate Comparison Guide","url":"https://www.builder.io/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code"},{"title":"Cursor Agent vs. Claude Code","url":"https://www.haihai.ai/cursor-vs-claude-code/"},{"title":"Cursor vs. Claude Code: in-depth comparison for dev teams | DECODE","url":"https://decode.agency/article/cursor-vs-claude-code/"},{"title":"Cursor vs Claude Code – Looking for Community Feedback - Discussions - Cursor - Community Forum","url":"https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-vs-claude-code-looking-for-community-feedback/148153"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what developers have been saying about switching from Cursor to Claude Code in 2025:\n\n## Key Differences in Developer Experience\n\n### Cursor's Strengths\nCursor is often championed as the ultimate tool for \"vibe coding\"—where you rapidly prototype ideas, iterate on UIs, and build apps from scratch without getting bogged down in syntax.(no content)For typing code you already know, Cursor's tab-completion is faster than any alternative.(no content)Visual diffs and seeing changes inline in your editor beats reviewing terminal output for some developers.

It understands your entire codebase, enabling it to suggest changes across multiple files while maintaining consistency, making it especially useful for tasks like refactoring or handling multi-file updates.\n\n**Claude Code:**\n- Claude Code is best for rapid prototypes and a productive terminal UX.\n- Claude Code's 200K context window and pay-per-use API pricing make it perfect for terminal-first developers tackling large codebase refactoring.\n- Claude Code's terminal-native design appeals to developers preferring command-line workflows, enabling integration with existing shell scripts and automation pipelines. This approach trades visual IDE features for greater scriptability and support for remote development.\n\n**GitHub Copilot:**\n- GitHub Copilot reached 15 million developers by early 2025.\n- GitHub Copilot works as an extension for popular IDEs like VS Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. It integrates directly into your existing workflow, offering AI-driven code suggestions as you type.\n- The research shows 88% retention rate for Copilot suggestions, indicating that developers find the AI-generated code appropriate for their projects. Copilot excels at completing patterns it has seen frequently in its training data.\n\n### Search Speed & Large Codebase Performance\nPure vector search (GitHub Copilot) delivers sub-minute responses but fails to find the right files. Agentic search (Codex, Claude Code) finds more relevant code but takes 3-5 minutes per search.(no content)The difference between the fastest and slowest tools is the difference between waiting 1 minute and waiting 5 minutes for a complete response. For a developer submitting 20-30 AI prompts per day, this translates to either 20-30 minutes or 1.5-2.5 hours spent waiting.\n\n### Caveats\nA randomized controlled trial by METR found that AI tools increased task completion time by 19% among experienced developers.

It understands your entire codebase, enabling it to suggest changes across multiple files while maintaining consistency, making it especially useful for tasks like refactoring or handling multi-file updates.\n\n**Claude Code:**\n- Claude Code is best for rapid prototypes and a productive terminal UX.\n- Claude Code's 200K context window and pay-per-use API pricing make it perfect for terminal-first developers tackling large codebase refactoring.\n- Claude Code's terminal-native design appeals to developers preferring command-line workflows, enabling integration with existing shell scripts and automation pipelines. This approach trades visual IDE features for greater scriptability and support for remote development.\n\n**GitHub Copilot:**\n- GitHub Copilot reached 15 million developers by early 2025.\n- GitHub Copilot works as an extension for popular IDEs like VS Code, JetBrains, and Visual Studio. It integrates directly into your existing workflow, offering AI-driven code suggestions as you type.\n- The research shows 88% retention rate for Copilot suggestions, indicating that developers find the AI-generated code appropriate for their projects. Copilot excels at completing patterns it has seen frequently in its training data.\n\n### Search Speed & Large Codebase Performance\nPure vector search (GitHub Copilot) delivers sub-minute responses but fails to find the right files. Agentic search (Codex, Claude Code) finds more relevant code but takes 3-5 minutes per search.(no content)The difference between the fastest and slowest tools is the difference between waiting 1 minute and waiting 5 minutes for a complete response. For a developer submitting 20-30 AI prompts per day, this translates to either 20-30 minutes or 1.5-2.5 hours spent waiting.\n\n### Caveats\nA randomized controlled trial by METR found that AI tools increased task completion time by 19% among experienced developers. At the same time, GitClear's analysis of 211 million lines of code changes documented an 8-fold increase in code duplication during 2024.(no content)The Harness State of Software Delivery 2025 found that 67% of developers spend more time debugging AI-generated code than they do writing code manually.\n\n### Recommendations\nThere's no universal \"best\" tool - only the best tool for your specific requirements. Many successful teams employ multiple tools strategically: an IDE-based tool for daily development (Cursor or Windsurf), terminal tools for automation (Claude Code), and enterprise platforms for compliance (Copilot)."],"durationSeconds":30.460155582994222}}

It's also helpful for analyzing error logs and interpreting unfamiliar code.(no content)If you want one deeply reasoned path with a clear plan, Claude Code is the better choice.\n\n**Key strengths:**\n- Claude Code offers superior instruction following, especially in terminal-based or multi-file workflows.\n- Use the --add-dir flag to give Claude access to additional directories outside your main working folder, making it better suited for monorepos, shared libraries, or multi-service architectures.\n- PR creation, test generation, and CI/CD fixes - it reads failure logs, identifies problems, and pushes fixes. \"Your broken builds fix themselves.\"\n- Claude Code on average produces less overall code reworks by close to 30% and gets things right in the first or second iteration.\n- Claude Code wins on ability to interact with tests and version control.\n\n### When to Use Cursor\n\nCursor is better for real-time code completion, in-editor assistance, and developers who want AI embedded in their IDE.(no content)Cursor is ideal for developers who want fast, hands-on, AI-assisted coding directly inside their editor. Cursor shines in production coding, prototyping, and rapid implementation.\n\n**Key strengths:**\n- Cursor is VS Code rebuilt with AI as part of the editor's DNA. It looks and feels exactly like VS Code, but the AI sees what you see, knows what you know, and can actually make the changes instead of just suggesting them.\n- Cursor gives you breadth, parallel strategies, and strong isolation between agents. If you want to explore and have several alternatives, Cursor fits better.\n- Cursor loyalists value its IDE diff view, GitHub repo flow, and hands-on learning, preferring a UI over terminal for control and understanding changes.\n- Cursor wins on cost.\n\n### Combining Both Tools\n\nSome developers blend tools: run Claude Code inside VS Code/Cursor until hitting token limits, then fall back to Cursor; use Cursor for planning and MCP tools, then Claude Code for execution.(no content)For most folks, Claude Code is not going to be a replacement for Cursor. It's going to be something they use in addition to Cursor.\n\n### Cost Considerations\n\nBoth start at $20/mo but work differently.(no content)One comparison found Claude Code was about four times more expensive than Cursor for the same tasks, though this can vary between 2x to 8x depending on usage.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c23c34e0-a6d6-4fa8-bf34-411ca55c279a","timestamp":"2026-01-10T16:02:23.457Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"when to use Claude Code\" vs \"when to use Cursor\" use cases recommendations","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Xij2kCV2xeG2PTZHiPgASg","content":[{"title":"Claude Code vs Cursor: Deep Comparison for Dev Teams [2025] - Qodo","url":"https://www.qodo.ai/blog/claude-code-vs-cursor/"},{"title":"Cursor vs Claude Code: The Ultimate Comparison Guide","url":"https://www.builder.io/blog/cursor-vs-claude-code"},{"title":"Cursor or Claude Code? : Cursor Discussion Forums | Product Hunt","url":"https://www.producthunt.com/p/cursor/cursor-or-claude-code"},{"title":"I tested Cursor vs Claude Code: One took 2 minutes, the other took 24 | by Chris Dunlop | Realworld AI Use Cases | Nov, 2025 | Medium","url":"https://medium.com/realworld-ai-use-cases/i-tested-cursor-vs-claude-code-one-took-2-minutes-the-other-took-24-0b0614484f34"},{"title":"Cursor CLI vs Claude Code: Why I Switched Back","url":"https://www.ksred.com/why-im-back-using-cursor-and-why-their-cli-changes-everything/"},{"title":"Cursor Agent vs. Claude Code","url":"https://www.haihai.ai/cursor-vs-claude-code/"},{"title":"Cursor vs Claude Code – Looking for Community Feedback - Discussions - Cursor - Community Forum","url":"https://forum.cursor.com/t/cursor-vs-claude-code-looking-for-community-feedback/148153"},{"title":"Cursor vs. Claude Code: in-depth comparison for dev teams | DECODE","url":"https://decode.agency/article/cursor-vs-claude-code/"},{"title":"Claude Code vs Cursor: Which is Best for Your Dev Workflow?","url":"https://www.cbtnuggets.com/blog/technology/devops/claude-code-vs-cursor"},{"title":"Claude Code vs Cursor: Complete comparison guide in 2026 | Blog — Northflank","url":"https://northflank.com/blog/claude-code-vs-cursor-comparison"}]},"Based on the search results, here's a comprehensive comparison of when to use Claude Code vs Cursor:\n\n## Claude Code vs Cursor: Use Case Recommendations\n\n### When to Use Claude Code\n\nClaude Code is better for autonomous, multi-file operations, large-scale refactoring, and command-line driven workflows.(no content)Use Claude Code when migrating legacy code, generating multi-step implementation plans, or performing detailed code reviews.
