for example, a doc-reviewer subagent might only have access to Read and Grep tools, ensuring it can analyze but never accidentally modify documentation files.\n\n### Built-in Subagents\n\nClaude Code includes several built-in subagents like Explore, Plan, and general-purpose.\n\n- **Explore**: A fast, read-only agent optimized for searching and analyzing codebases, used when Claude needs to search or understand a codebase without making changes.\n\n- **Plan**: Used for codebase research for planning when you're in plan mode and Claude needs to understand your codebase.\n\n- **General-purpose**: A capable agent for complex, multi-step tasks that require both exploration and action, used when tasks require both exploration and modification, complex reasoning, or multiple dependent steps.\n\n### How Subagents Work\n\n**Delegation Process**: When you define subagents, Claude decides whether to invoke them based on each subagent's description field - clear descriptions explain when the subagent should be used, and Claude will automatically delegate appropriate tasks.\n\n**Execution Flow**: The sub-agent receives the delegated task, operates within its own context window (preventing main conversation pollution), uses only its assigned tools, follows its custom system prompt, and after completing its task returns only the relevant information to the main agent.\n\n**No Nested Delegation**: Subagents cannot spawn their own subagents.\n\n### Configuration\n\nSubagents are defined in Markdown files with YAML frontmatter.(no content)They include a name, description, and optional tool list, and can be discovered and invoked by Claude Code from your project's .claude/agents/ directory or from your user scope.\n\n### Benefits\n\n**Context Isolation**: One important advantage of agents is that they have their own context window and can provide a summary after doing extensive research to the main agent, saving precious time within the main agent before it has to 'compact'.\n\n**Parallel Execution**: Multiple subagents can run concurrently, dramatically speeding up complex workflows -

Here's what I found:\n\n## What Are Claude Code Subagents?\n\nSubagents are specialized AI assistants that handle specific types of tasks. Each subagent runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions.\n\n## Real-World Use Cases & Examples\n\n### 1. **Large-Scale Code Refactoring**\nTo deprecate a function used in 75 files, have a primary agent grep for all instances, then spin up a dedicated sub-agent for each file to perform the replacement in a small, safe context. Even better if the refactor could be explained via an SOP; define the SOP as a command or a subagent and iteratively kick them off to complete the work.\n\n### 2. **Incident Response Analysis**\nTo understand an outage across three microservices, use three sub-agents to analyze each service's logs in parallel. Each one extracts a timeline of critical events. The main agent's job is much simpler: synthesize the three pre-processed timelines into a single report.\n\n### 3. **Product Management Workflows**\nA PM can take a CSV of 500 survey responses. A primary agent defines key themes (e.g., UI/UX, Performance, Pricing, Feature Requests).\n\n### 4. **Development Pipeline at PubNub**\nPubNub uses a three-stage pipeline: pm-spec reads an enhancement and writes a working spec; architect-review validates design against platform constraints and produces an ADR; implementer-tester implements code & tests (unit + optional UI via Playwright), updates docs, flips status DONE.\n\n## Performance Benefits\n\n### Context Window Optimization\nBy using subagents you give each specialist its own dedicated context window, ensuring the quality of each step is preserved. The product-manager was able to use its entire 200k context to focus only on user needs and business logic. The senior-software-engineer then received the final ticket and could use its own fresh 200k context to focus only on implementation.\n\n### Parallel Execution\nMultiple subagents can run concurrently, dramatically speeding up complex workflows. Example: during a code review, you can run style-checker, security-scanner, and test-coverage subagents simultaneously, reducing review time from minutes to seconds.\n\n## Available Subagent Collections\n\nA GitHub repository serves as the definitive collection of Claude Code subagents - specialized AI assitants designed for specific development tasks. The collection includes over 100+ specialized subagents covering categories like:\n\n- Essential development (everyday coding tasks)\n- Language-specific experts\n- DevOps and cloud specialists\n- Testing, security, and code quality experts\n- Data engineering and ML specialists\n- Product management and business analysis\n\n## Built-in Subagents (2026)\n\nClaude Code includes a fast, read-only agent optimized for searching and analyzing codebases with the purpose of file discovery, code search, and codebase exploration.\n\n## Best Practices Recommendations\n\nFor complex problems, consider strong use of subagents. Telling Claude to use subagents to verify details or investigate particular questions it might have, especially early on in a conversation or task, tends to preserve context availability without much downside in terms of lost efficiency.\n\nThe search results show that Claude Code subagents are being actively used in production environments in 2025-2026, with real-world implementations at companies like PubNub and extensive community-developed subagent libraries for various development scenarios.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"12ddc6dc-a872-43a1-ac3a-759646aa98a7","timestamp":"2026-01-10T21:07:10.675Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Claude Code subagent real world examples use cases performance 2026","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Pe9MAA9gfbDgkqLuVVPR7h","content":[{"title":"GitHub - VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents: A collection of 100+ specialized Claude Code subagents covering a wide range of development use cases","url":"https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents"},{"title":"Create custom subagents - Claude Code Docs","url":"https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents"},{"title":"How to Use Claude Code Subagents to Parallelize Development | zach wills","url":"https://zachwills.net/how-to-use-claude-code-subagents-to-parallelize-development/"},{"title":"Best practices for Claude Code subagents","url":"https://www.pubnub.com/blog/best-practices-for-claude-code-sub-agents/"},{"title":"A Guide to Claude Code 2.0 and getting better at using coding agents | sankalp's blog","url":"https://sankalp.bearblog.dev/my-experience-with-claude-code-20-and-how-to-get-better-at-using-coding-agents/"},{"title":"Subagents in the SDK - Claude Docs","url":"https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents"},{"title":"GitHub - lst97/claude-code-sub-agents: Collection of specialized AI subagents for Claude Code for personal use (full-stack development).","url":"https://github.com/lst97/claude-code-sub-agents"},{"title":"Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding","url":"https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices"},{"title":"GitHub - wesammustafa/Claude-Code-Everything-You-Need-to-Know: The ultimate all-in-one guide to mastering Claude Code.

Each subagent runs in its own context window with a custom system prompt, specific tool access, and independent permissions.\n\n## Real-World Use Cases & Examples\n\n### 1. **Large-Scale Code Refactoring**\nTo deprecate a function used in 75 files, have a primary agent grep for all instances, then spin up a dedicated sub-agent for each file to perform the replacement in a small, safe context. Even better if the refactor could be explained via an SOP; define the SOP as a command or a subagent and iteratively kick them off to complete the work.\n\n### 2. **Incident Response Analysis**\nTo understand an outage across three microservices, use three sub-agents to analyze each service's logs in parallel. Each one extracts a timeline of critical events. The main agent's job is much simpler: synthesize the three pre-processed timelines into a single report.\n\n### 3. **Product Management Workflows**\nA PM can take a CSV of 500 survey responses. A primary agent defines key themes (e.g., UI/UX, Performance, Pricing, Feature Requests).\n\n### 4. **Development Pipeline at PubNub**\nPubNub uses a three-stage pipeline: pm-spec reads an enhancement and writes a working spec; architect-review validates design against platform constraints and produces an ADR; implementer-tester implements code & tests (unit + optional UI via Playwright), updates docs, flips status DONE.\n\n## Performance Benefits\n\n### Context Window Optimization\nBy using subagents you give each specialist its own dedicated context window, ensuring the quality of each step is preserved. The product-manager was able to use its entire 200k context to focus only on user needs and business logic. The senior-software-engineer then received the final ticket and could use its own fresh 200k context to focus only on implementation.\n\n### Parallel Execution\nMultiple subagents can run concurrently, dramatically speeding up complex workflows. Example: during a code review, you can run style-checker, security-scanner, and test-coverage subagents simultaneously, reducing review time from minutes to seconds.\n\n## Available Subagent Collections\n\nA GitHub repository serves as the definitive collection of Claude Code subagents - specialized AI assitants designed for specific development tasks. The collection includes over 100+ specialized subagents covering categories like:\n\n- Essential development (everyday coding tasks)\n- Language-specific experts\n- DevOps and cloud specialists\n- Testing, security, and code quality experts\n- Data engineering and ML specialists\n- Product management and business analysis\n\n## Built-in Subagents (2026)\n\nClaude Code includes a fast, read-only agent optimized for searching and analyzing codebases with the purpose of file discovery, code search, and codebase exploration.\n\n## Best Practices Recommendations\n\nFor complex problems, consider strong use of subagents. Telling Claude to use subagents to verify details or investigate particular questions it might have, especially early on in a conversation or task, tends to preserve context availability without much downside in terms of lost efficiency.\n\nThe search results show that Claude Code subagents are being actively used in production environments in 2025-2026, with real-world implementations at companies like PubNub and extensive community-developed subagent libraries for various development scenarios."],"durationSeconds":31.704670249998568}}

Like, really slow\" and \"the overhead of using subagents cancels out some of the speed benefits.\"\n\n**Filtering Concerns:**\nThe main agent \"doesn't genuinely mirror the real output of the sub-agent\" and appears to \"beautify\" reality by \"filtering out negative feedback from the code reviewer.\"\n\n**Usability:**\nAn experienced developer found \"the process slow, the learning curve steep, & the outcome the same as using the Claude model within Cursor, just less clear.\"\n\n## Cost Perspective\n\nIt's \"best for experienced developers working on multi-file projects\" where \"$20-$200/month cost pays for itself if you save 2+ hours monthly,\" but users shouldn't \"expect it to architect entire applications from vague ideas.\"(no content)Claude Code is \"most effective for experienced developers who know what good output looks like.\""],"durationSeconds":21.155749458000063}}

Here's what I found:\n\n---\n\n## 1. How Claude Code's Subagent System Works\n\n### Architecture\nClaude Code's subagent system uses **independent context windows** where each subagent operates in complete isolation from the main agent. Each subagent has:\n- **Custom system prompts** with specialized expertise\n- **Tool restrictions** limiting access to specific capabilities (e.g., read-only agents can't modify files)\n- **Independent permissions** preventing unintended actions\n\n### Delegation Process\nThe main agent decides when to invoke subagents based on their description fields. Once delegated:\n1. The subagent receives the task and operates in its own context\n2. Uses only its assigned tools\n3. Follows its custom system prompt\n4. Returns **only relevant summary information** to the main agent (not the entire conversation)\n\n### Built-in Subagents\n- **Explore**: Fast, read-only agent for searching and analyzing codebases\n- **Plan**: Research agent for planning mode\n- **General-purpose**: For complex multi-step tasks requiring both exploration and modification\n\n### Critical Limitation\n**No nested delegation** - subagents cannot spawn their own subagents, preventing agent pyramids.\n\n---\n\n## 2. Problems Subagents Solve\n\n### Context Window Optimization\nThe primary benefit: each specialist gets its own dedicated context window. A product-manager subagent can use its entire 200k context for business logic, then a senior-software-engineer subagent receives the final ticket and uses a fresh 200k context for implementation.\n\n### Parallel Execution\nMultiple subagents can run concurrently, dramatically speeding up workflows. Example: running style-checker, security-scanner, and test-coverage subagents simultaneously during code review.\n\n### Task Isolation\nPrevents \"context pollution\" where extensive research or exploration clutters the main conversation with irrelevant details.\n\n---\n\n## 3. Real-World Examples\n\n### Large-Scale Refactoring\nTo deprecate a function in 75 files: the primary agent greps for all instances, then spins up dedicated subagents for each file to perform replacements in small, safe contexts.\n\n### Incident Response Analysis\nAnalyzing an outage across three microservices: three subagents analyze each service's logs in parallel, each extracting a timeline. The main agent synthesizes the three pre-processed timelines into a single report.\n\n### PubNub's Production Pipeline\nPubNub uses a three-stage pipeline:\n1. **pm-spec**: Reads enhancement requests and writes working specs\n2. **architect-review**: Validates design and produces ADR documents\n3. **implementer-tester**: Implements code, tests, updates docs\n\n---\n\n## 4. Performance Benefits\n\n### Measured Improvements\n- **Context preservation**: Main agent doesn't need to \"compact\" as often\n- **Speed**: Parallel execution reduces review time from minutes to seconds\n- **Quality**: Each specialist maintains focus without distraction from other tasks\n\n### Community Collections\nOver **100+ specialized subagents** available in community repositories covering:\n- Language-specific experts\n- DevOps and cloud specialists\n- Testing and security\n- Data engineering and ML\n- Product management\n\n---\n\n## 5. Limitations and Failures\n\n### GitHub Issues Found\n\n**Context Propagation Problems** ([Issue #237](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/issues/237))\n- Subagents miss injected context from main session\n- TDD disciplines and frameworks don't propagate to subagents\n\n**Subagent Selection Failures** ([Issue #5688](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/5688))\n- Primary agents ignore proactive directives\n- Even explicit instructions like \"use this agent proactively\" in all caps fail\n- Requires manual invocation instead of automatic selection\n\n**Delegation Problems** ([Issue #9417](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9417))\n- Primary agent claims it cannot use task tool to launch subagents\n- Fails at core role of delegating to other agents\n\n**Resource Consumption**\n- Multiple subagents can cause 100% CPU usage\n- Systems grind to halt requiring hard restarts\n\n**\"Fire-and-Forget\" Limitation** ([Issue #5812](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/5812), [Issue #1770](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1770))\n- No direct communication channel between parent and child\n- Parent has no visibility into subagent activities until completion\n- Subagents can't augment parent's knowledge during execution\n\n---\n\n## 6. Context Preservation\n\n### How Data Flows\n- Subagent completes task list\n- Returns **concise resulting context** to parent (not viewable by default, accessible via Ctrl+O)\n- Messages include `parent_tool_use_id` field for tracking\n- Parent integrates only relevant information into main conversation\n\n### The Trade-off\nWhile this prevents context pollution, it creates a **visibility gap** - the parent is blind to subagent progress until completion.\n\n---\n\n## 7. Communication Patterns\n\n### Current Implementation\n- Subagents invoked via **Task tool**\n- One-way communication: parent → subagent → summary back\n- No real-time updates or bidirectional dialogue\n\n### Community Requests\nFeature requests for:\n- Hooks to bridge context between subagents and parent\n- Real-time monitoring of subagent activities\n- True multi-agent orchestration with ongoing communication\n\n---\n\n## 8. Real User Experiences\n\n### Positive Feedback\n- \"Claude Code gives me the best experience in coding overall\"\n- Useful for faster searches in large codebases\n- \"Analogous to multi-threading\" for parallel tasks\n\n### Critical Feedback\n- **Performance**: \"Subagents can be a bit 'dumber' than a single Claude instance\"\n- **Speed**: \"SLOW. Like, really slow\" - overhead cancels out speed benefits\n- **Filtering concerns**: Main agent \"beautifies\" reality by filtering negative feedback from code reviewers\n- **Learning curve**: \"Process slow, learning curve steep, outcome same as using Claude in Cursor\"\n\n### Verdict\nSubagents are \"useful but with a big asterisk\" - powerful but immature technology. Best for experienced developers on multi-file projects, not for vague architectural ideas.\n\n---\n\n## 9. Could This Be Implemented in Roo Code?\n\n### **YES** - Roo Code Already Has Multi-Agent Foundations\n\nRoo Code **already implements multi-agent concepts** through:\n\n**Mode-Based Agents**\n- Architect Mode: Planning and high-level design\n- Code Mode: Implementation with precise diffs\n- Debug Mode: Terminal inspection and log analysis\n- Ask Mode: Quick queries\n\n**Cloud Agents** (Roo Code Cloud)\n- Planner, Coder, PR Reviewer, PR Fixer agents\n- Each specialized for specific tasks\n\n**Orchestration Capability**\nRoo acts as orchestrator, delegating tasks to the right mode at the right time.\n\n---\n\n## 10. Technical Challenges in Adding Claude-Style Subagents\n\n### Architecture Challenges\n\n**1. Context Window Isolation**\n- Roo Code currently uses **LIFO stack for nested execution** (ClineProvider manages task hierarchy)\n- Would need separate context window instances for each subagent\n- Challenge: Managing multiple LLM API connections simultaneously\n\n**2. Communication Infrastructure**\n- Current architecture: Extension backend (extension host) ↔ Webview UI (React)\n- Message passing via WebviewMessage.ts and ExtensionMessage.ts\n- Would need: Parent agent ↔ Multiple child agents with summary returns\n\n**3. VS Code Extension API Limits**\n- VS Code extension API \"was never designed for deep, system-level AI integration\"\n- API is \"deliberately stable and constrained\"\n- May require forking VS Code for deeper integration (like Cursor did)\n\n### Implementation Requirements\n\n**1. Task Delegation System**\n- Need Task tool equivalent to spawn subagents\n- Subagent registry with descriptions for automatic selection\n- Parent-child tracking via `parent_tool_use_id` mechanism\n\n**2. Resource Management**\n- Prevent 100% CPU usage from parallel agents\n- Implement throttling and concurrency limits\n- Memory management for multiple context windows\n\n**3. State Management**\n- ExtensionStateProvider would need hierarchical state trees\n- Track which agent owns which context\n- Merge subagent results into parent context safely\n\n**4. Tool Access Control**\n- Current ApiHandler supports 30+ providers\n- Need per-subagent tool restrictions\n- Implement read-only, write-restricted, and full-access modes\n\n**5. Configuration System**\n- YAML frontmatter for subagent definitions (like Claude Code)\n- Discovery from `.roo/agents/` directory\n- User-scoped and project-scoped subagents\n\n---\n\n## 11. Would It Actually Make Roo Code Better?\n\n### Arguments FOR Implementation\n\n**1. Context Window Efficiency**\n- Large codebases consume context quickly\n- Dedicated subagent contexts prevent main agent compaction\n- Each specialist gets full 200k context\n\n**2. Parallel Processing**\n- Dramatically faster for multi-file operations\n- Security scans, style checks, test coverage in parallel\n- Real productivity gains on complex projects\n\n**3. Competitive Feature Parity**\n- Claude Code has it\n- VS Code Copilot now has subagents (v1.105+)\n- Roo Code needs this to stay competitive\n\n**4. Specialization**\n- Community could build subagent libraries\n- Language-specific experts, framework specialists\n- Reusable expertise across projects\n\n### Arguments AGAINST Implementation\n\n**1. User Experience Issues**\n- \"Learning curve steep\" - adds complexity\n- Users report subagents are \"dumber\" than main agent\n- Overhead can cancel out speed benefits\n\n**2. Technical Debt**\n- Roo Code already has mode switching (Architect → Code)\n- Adding subagents creates **two parallel systems**\n- Maintenance burden for minimal gain\n\n**3. Resource Consumption**\n- 100% CPU usage reports from Claude Code\n- Multiple API calls = higher costs\n- May degrade rather than improve performance\n\n**4. Communication Gaps**\n- \"Fire-and-forget\" limitation is fundamental\n- No real-time parent-child communication\n- Users want bidirectional dialogue, not just summaries\n\n**5. Existing Alternatives**\n- Roo Code's **Boomerang tasks** coordinate workflows between modes\n- Mode orchestration already handles role delegation\n- Cloud Agents provide specialized capabilities\n\n---\n\n## 12. Recommendation: What Would Be Required to Build This?\n\n### Minimum Viable Implementation\n\n**Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (2-3 weeks)**\n1. Create `SubagentManager` class to handle spawning/tracking\n2. Implement isolated context windows per subagent\n3. Build Task tool equivalent for delegation\n4. Add parent-child message passing protocol\n\n**Phase 2: Configuration System (1-2 weeks)**\n5. YAML parser for subagent definitions\n6. Discovery system for `.roo/agents/` directory\n7. Tool access control per subagent\n8. Custom system prompt injection\n\n**Phase 3: UI/UX (1-2 weeks)**\n9. Webview UI for monitoring active subagents\n10. Progress indicators for parallel execution\n11. Context summary display (Ctrl+O equivalent)\n\n**Phase 4: Optimization (2-3 weeks)**\n12. Concurrency limits and throttling\n13. Resource monitoring and auto-scaling\n14. Smart subagent selection based on descriptions\n\n**Total Estimated Effort: 6-10 weeks for MVP**\n\n### Alternative: Enhance Existing Systems\n\n**Instead of subagents, improve what exists:**\n1. **Better mode orchestration** - make mode switching smarter\n2. **Context management tools** - help users manage context without subagents\n3. **Parallel task execution** - within single agent context\n4. **Cloud Agent expansion** - add more specialized cloud agents\n\n---\n\n## Final Assessment\n\n**Should Roo Code add Claude-style subagents?**\n\n**Probably not as currently designed.** Here's why:\n\n1. **Roo Code already has multi-agent concepts** through modes and cloud agents\n2. **User feedback on subagents is mixed** - powerful but problematic\n3. **Technical challenges are substantial** - 6-10 weeks for MVP, ongoing maintenance\n4. **VS Code is adding native subagent support** - may be better to integrate with that\n5. **Communication limitations** make subagents \"fire-and-forget\" rather than true collaboration\n\n**Better alternatives:**\n- **Integrate with VS Code's native subagent API** (v1.105+) rather than building custom\n- **Enhance mode orchestration** for better task delegation\n- **Expand Cloud Agents** for specialized capabilities\n- **Add hierarchical workflow support** (requested in [Issue #6298](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code/issues/6298))\n\n**If you do build it:**\n- Start with VS Code's `runSubagent` tool integration\n- Focus on solving the communication gap (real-time updates)\n- Implement concurrency limits from day one\n- Make subagent selection automatic and intelligent\n- Provide clear UX for when subagents are running\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n### Claude Code Architecture & Documentation\n- [Create custom subagents - Claude Code Docs](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/sub-agents)\n- [Subagents in the SDK - Claude Docs](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agent-sdk/subagents)\n- [Best practices for Claude Code subagents](https://www.pubnub.com/blog/best-practices-for-claude-code-sub-agents/)\n- [How Sub-Agents Work in Claude Code: A Complete Guide](https://medium.com/@kinjal01radadiya/how-sub-agents-work-in-claude-code-a-complete-guide-bafc66bbaf70)\n- [Subagents in Claude Code: AI Architecture Guide](https://wmedia.es/en/writing/claude-code-subagents-guide-ai)\n\n### Real-World Use Cases\n- [How to Use Claude Code Subagents to Parallelize Development](https://zachwills.net/how-to-use-claude-code-subagents-to-parallelize-development/)\n- [GitHub - VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents](https://github.com/VoltAgent/awesome-claude-code-subagents)\n- [Claude Code: Best practices for agentic coding](https://www.anthropic.com/engineering/claude-code-best-practices)\n\n### Issues & Limitations\n- [Issues · anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues)\n- [Claude Code subagents miss context - Issue #237](https://github.com/obra/superpowers/issues/237)\n- [Subagent Selection Failure - Issue #5688](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/5688)\n- [Delegation problems - Issue #9417](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/9417)\n- [Parent-Child Communication - Issue #1770](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/1770)\n- [Context Bridging - Issue #5812](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/5812)\n\n### User Experiences\n- [Are Claude Code Subagents Useful?
