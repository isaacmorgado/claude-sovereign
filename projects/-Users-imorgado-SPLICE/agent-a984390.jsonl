That site had one job: to introduce a new design tool to the world. Fast forward to 2024, and things look pretty different. Figma has gone from a design tool to a platform for all kinds of product teams, and their web presence needed to keep up.(no content)As a designer on their Brand Studio team noted, the previous system was starting to show its limitations. They had many components in their library that were only slightly different from one another, making it challenging for designers and content authors to choose the right one. Their color system wasn't flexible enough, and typography wasn't optimized for the range of content they now produce.\n\n### CTA Button Design Focus\n\nOne big focus in the redesign was rethinking their call-to-action (CTA) buttons. It's such a small component, but it's everywhere. They knew if they could imbue a little bit of the brand there, it would be really special.(no content)They also used prototyping to work out more complex elements, like their new sign-up outro CTA that appears at the end of pages. They explored how a component like this could impact user flows and aid in product storytelling across different screen sizes. For product hero sections, prototyping let them fine-tune sizing and test different content orders with the wider team.\n\n### Figma's Hero Section CTA Strategy\n\nFigma's hero section features one compelling CTA: \"Get started for free,\" which aligns with the company's primary conversion goal. Figma's hero section shows how a single, well-crafted CTA can drive powerful results.(no content)Their \"Get started for free\" button stands out through strategic positioning and contrast, while the messaging reduces friction by emphasizing the risk-free nature of taking action. By focusing on just one conversion path, Figma creates a clear and confident user journey. The absence of additional CTAs doesn't limit options—instead, it streamlines decision-making and maintains momentum toward their primary goal.\n\n### Industry Best Practices Supporting This Approach\n\nAnalysis shows that too many CTAs can significantly impact conversion rates—with some studies showing decreases of up to 266% when multiple competing actions are presented.

That site had one job: to introduce a new design tool to the world. Fast forward to 2024, and things look pretty different. Figma has gone from a design tool to a platform for all kinds of product teams, and their web presence needed to keep up.(no content)As a designer on their Brand Studio team noted, the previous system was starting to show its limitations. They had many components in their library that were only slightly different from one another, making it challenging for designers and content authors to choose the right one. Their color system wasn't flexible enough, and typography wasn't optimized for the range of content they now produce.\n\n### CTA Button Design Focus\n\nOne big focus in the redesign was rethinking their call-to-action (CTA) buttons. It's such a small component, but it's everywhere. They knew if they could imbue a little bit of the brand there, it would be really special.(no content)They also used prototyping to work out more complex elements, like their new sign-up outro CTA that appears at the end of pages. They explored how a component like this could impact user flows and aid in product storytelling across different screen sizes. For product hero sections, prototyping let them fine-tune sizing and test different content orders with the wider team.\n\n### Figma's Hero Section CTA Strategy\n\nFigma's hero section features one compelling CTA: \"Get started for free,\" which aligns with the company's primary conversion goal. Figma's hero section shows how a single, well-crafted CTA can drive powerful results.(no content)Their \"Get started for free\" button stands out through strategic positioning and contrast, while the messaging reduces friction by emphasizing the risk-free nature of taking action. By focusing on just one conversion path, Figma creates a clear and confident user journey. The absence of additional CTAs doesn't limit options—instead, it streamlines decision-making and maintains momentum toward their primary goal.\n\n### Industry Best Practices Supporting This Approach\n\nAnalysis shows that too many CTAs can significantly impact conversion rates—with some studies showing decreases of up to 266% when multiple competing actions are presented. For maximum impact, keep your hero section focused with a single, clear CTA, or at most, a primary and secondary option that doesn't compete.(no content)A 2024 A/B testing study by VWO found that landing pages with clear text and call-to-action buttons increased conversions by up to 20% compared to image-heavy designs, as they reduce decision fatigue and align with users' natural scanning patterns.\n\n### Hero Image Best Practices from Figma's Dictionary\n\nHero images can be employed to display your unique selling point or value proposition. A high-quality image, coupled with a compelling tagline and a clear call-to-action (CTA) button, can effectively communicate your brand's core message and incite users to take the desired action."],"durationSeconds":31.8375652090013}}

Hero Section Design\n\n### Key Patterns Observed\n\n**Vercel:**\n- Headline: \"Build and deploy on the AI Cloud\" - action-oriented, benefit-focused\n- Dual CTAs: \"Start Deploying\" (primary) + \"Get a Demo\" (secondary)\n- Clean light/dark theme with toggle system\n\n**Stripe:**\n- Headline: \"Financial infrastructure to grow your revenue\" - outcome-focused\n- Angled/skewed background using CSS transforms for visual dynamism\n- Dual CTAs: \"Start now\" + \"Sign up with Google\" (friction-reduced paths)\n- Dark navy (#0a2540) with \"blurple\" (#635bff) accent\n\n**Notion:**\n- Headline: \"One workspace. Zero busywork.\" - concise, pain-point focused\n- Multi-colored bento grid layout with distinct color blocks\n- Dual CTAs: \"Get Notion free\" + \"Request a demo\"\n\n**Linear (from research):**\n- Dark mode with bold typography and complex gradients\n- Glassmorphism effects with high color contrast\n- 2025 evolution: monochrome black/white with fewer bold accent colors\n- Isolated UI component hero showcasing specific features rather than full screenshots\n\n**Figma:**\n- Single focused CTA: \"Get started for free\"\n- Studies show single CTAs can increase conversions vs multiple competing actions\n- Strategic positioning with strong contrast\n\n### Recommendations for SPLICE\n\n```\nHEADLINE FORMULA: [Action] + [Outcome] + [Time Saved]\nExample: \"Edit videos 10x faster with AI-powered silence removal\"\n\nCTA STRUCTURE:\n- Primary: \"Start Free Trial\" (high contrast button)\n- Secondary: \"Watch Demo\" (outline/ghost button)\n\nVISUAL APPROACH:\n- Dark theme (matches Premiere Pro aesthetic)\n- Single accent color (suggest vibrant blue or orange)\n- Show actual plugin UI in hero, not generic mockup\n```\n\n---\n\n## 2. Feature Presentation\n\n### Key Patterns Observed\n\n**Vercel:**\n- Use cases as cards: AI Apps, Web Apps, Commerce, Multi-tenant\n- Framework showcase with color-coded visual branding per framework\n- Live data/leaderboards for credibility\n\n**Stripe:**\n- Interactive card systems showing real dashboard mockups\n- Concrete visualization of actual product interfaces\n- Code editors demonstrating implementation simplicity\n\n**Notion:**\n- Bento grid layout with 4 main feature cards\n- Animated character illustrations paired with features\n- \"Coming soon\" labels create anticipation\n\n**Linear:**\n- Isolated UI components pulled from the app\n- Focus on specific features rather than overwhelming full screenshots\n- Bento box component patterns\n\n### Recommendations for SPLICE\n\n```\nFEATURE CARD STRUCTURE:\n1. Icon or mini-preview\n2. Feature name (bold)\n3. One-sentence benefit\n4. \"See it in action\" link\n\nSUGGESTED LAYOUT (Bento Grid):\n+------------------+------------------+\n|   SILENCE        |   AI TAKES       |\n|   REMOVAL        |   DETECTION      |\n|   (large card)   |   (large card)   |\n+------------------+------------------+\n|  J-CUTS  | MUSIC | CAPTIONS | ZOOM  |\n| (small)  |(small)| (small)  |(small)|\n+------------------+------------------+\n\nSHOWCASE APPROACH:\n- Use actual Premiere Pro screenshots with SPLICE panel visible\n- Short GIF/video loops showing before/after\n- Quantified benefits: \"Remove 47 silences in 3 seconds\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 3. Documentation Page Structure\n\n### Key Patterns (Stripe-style)\n\n**Three-Panel Layout:**\n```\n+-------------+------------------------+------------------+\n|  SIDEBAR    |    MAIN CONTENT        |  CODE EXAMPLES   |\n|  Navigation |    Documentation       |  (contextual)    |\n+-------------+------------------------+------------------+\n```\n\n**Hierarchy:**\n1. Getting Started (quick win in 5 minutes)\n2. Core Features (one page per major feature)\n3. API Reference (for advanced users)\n4. Troubleshooting / FAQ\n5. Changelog\n\n### Recommendations for SPLICE\n\n```\nDOCUMENTATION STRUCTURE:\n/docs\n  /getting-started\n    - installation.md\n    - first-edit.md (5-min quick start)\n    - presets.md\n  /features\n    - silence-removal.md\n    - take-detection.md\n    - j-cuts.md\n    - multitrack.md\n    - captions.md\n    - music-generation.md\n  /api (if exposing endpoints)\n  /troubleshooting\n  /changelog\n\nDESIGN ELEMENTS:\n- Persistent left sidebar with collapsible sections\n- Breadcrumbs at top\n- \"On this page\" table of contents on right\n- Video embeds for complex workflows\n- Copy-to-clipboard code blocks\n- \"Was this helpful?\" feedback at bottom\n```\n\n---\n\n## 4. CTA Placement and Design\n\n### Key Patterns\n\n**Placement Strategy (across all sites):**\n1. Hero section (primary conversion point)\n2. After each major feature section\n3. Sticky header CTA (appears on scroll)\n4. Footer CTA (last chance conversion)\n5. Documentation pages (contextual upgrade prompts)\n\n**Button Design:**\n- Primary: Solid, high contrast, bold text\n- Secondary: Outline/ghost style\n- Gradient buttons for premium actions (Stripe uses orange-to-red)\n\n**Friction Reducers:**\n- \"Get started for free\"\n- \"No credit card required\"\n- \"Start in 2 minutes\"\n- Social sign-in options\n\n### Recommendations for SPLICE\n\n```\nCTA PLACEMENT MAP:\n1. HERO: \"Start Free Trial\" + \"Watch Demo\"\n2. AFTER FEATURES: \"Try [Feature] Now\"\n3. STICKY HEADER: Appears after 300px scroll\n4. PRICING TABLE: \"Get Started\" per tier\n5. FOOTER: \"Ready to edit faster?\"\n\nBUTTON STYLING:\nPrimary: background: #3B82F6; color: white; font-weight: 600;\nSecondary: border: 2px solid #3B82F6; background: transparent;\nHover: Transform scale(1.02) + subtle shadow increase\n\nFRICTION REDUCERS TO ADD:\n- \"12 hours free processing included\"\n- \"Works with Premiere Pro 14.0+\"\n- \"No credit card for free tier\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## 5. Color Usage and Visual Hierarchy\n\n### Color Strategies Observed\n\n**Stripe:**\n- Dark navy (#0a2540) for authority\n- Blurple (#635bff) for interactivity\n- Gradient overlays (orange/red) for emphasis\n- White backgrounds with soft gray (#f6f9fc)\n\n**Vercel:**\n- Pure dark (#000) and light (#FAFAFA) themes\n- Minimal accent colors\n- Framework-specific color coding\n\n**Notion:**\n- Multi-colored bento blocks (teal, red, blue, yellow)\n- White/cream backgrounds\n- Playful illustrations soften enterprise feel\n\n**Linear:**\n- Monochrome black/white base\n- Very selective bold accent colors\n- High contrast for readability\n- Glassmorphism for depth\n\n### Recommendations for SPLICE\n\n```\nCOLOR PALETTE:\n\nPRIMARY DARK THEME (matches Premiere Pro):\n- Background: #1E1E1E (VS Code / Adobe dark)\n- Surface: #252526\n- Border: #3C3C3C\n- Text Primary: #FFFFFF\n- Text Secondary: #CCCCCC\n\nACCENT COLORS:\n- Primary Action: #0078D4 (Adobe blue) or #3B82F6 (modern blue)\n- Success: #10B981 (green for completed edits)\n- Warning: #F59E0B (orange for processing)\n- Error: #EF4444 (red)\n\nHIERARCHY RULES:\n1. Largest text = Benefits/Outcomes\n2. Medium text = Feature names\n3. Smallest text = Technical details\n4. Accent color = Interactive elements only\n5. White space = Group related content\n```\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Quick Implementation Checklist\n\n### Hero Section\n- [ ] Single focused headline with time-saved benefit\n- [ ] Dual CTAs (primary solid + secondary outline)\n- [ ] Actual product screenshot or video loop\n- [ ] Social proof logos below hero\n\n### Features\n- [ ] Bento grid with mixed card sizes\n- [ ] Before/after demonstrations\n- [ ] Quantified benefits on each card\n- [ ] \"See it in action\" micro-interactions\n\n### Documentation\n- [ ] Three-panel layout\n- [ ] 5-minute quick start guide\n- [ ] Video tutorials embedded\n- [ ] Search with autocomplete\n\n### CTAs\n- [ ] Sticky header after scroll\n- [ ] CTA after each feature section\n- [ ] Friction reducers near buttons\n- [ ] Consistent button styling\n\n### Colors\n- [ ] Dark theme primary\n- [ ] Single accent color for actions\n- [ ] High contrast for readability\n- [ ] Consistent use of white space\n\n---\n\n## Sources\n\n- [Linear Design Trend Analysis - LogRocket Blog](https://blog.logrocket.com/ux-design/linear-design/)\n- [Unsection - Linear Hero Section](https://www.unsection.com/section/linear-home-page-section-hero)\n- [2024 Design Trends - 5 Must Try Hero Layouts](https://designerup.co/blog/2024-design-trends-5-must-try-hero-layouts/)\n- [Figma Blog - Updating Our Web System For A New Era](https://www.figma.com/blog/updating-our-web-system-for-a-new-era/)\n- [Website Hero Section Best Practices - Prismic](https://prismic.io/blog/website-hero-section)\n- [Figma Hero Image Dictionary](https://www.figma.com/dictionary/hero-image/)\n- [GitHub - Rebuilding Linear.app](https://github.com/frontendfyi/rebuilding-linear.app)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":357,"cache_creation_input_tokens":561,"cache_read_input_tokens":33180,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":561,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWVjtEWuUEGeccJAd5yd5","type":"assistant","uuid":"b71ede89-e0a4-4dfc-82eb-00ed62834eb3","timestamp":"2025-12-26T18:05:17.611Z"}
