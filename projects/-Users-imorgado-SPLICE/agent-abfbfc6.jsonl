Modes are specialized AI agents focused on specific tasks like architecture, coding, testing, or documentation. Each mode has limited tool access to stay focused on its job. Modes are smart enough to request switching when a task falls outside their responsibilities, keeping work organized and efficient.(no content)Configuration profiles allow you to assign different AI models and settings to specific modes, like using o3 for architecture planning and Claude Sonnet 4 for code execution.(no content)Roo uses multi-agent, role-driven execution, while alternatives like Cline provide model-agnostic, stepwise planning.\n\n## AI Model Support\n\nOther tools are intrinsically bound by design to a specific provider (like Claude Code → Anthropic Models or Codex → OpenAI models). Roo on the other hand is model-agnostic, allowing you to choose the model that best fits your needs, according to your budget, skill profile, codebase and more. They support connecting to a wide range of model providers, giving you flexibility in how you access AI models.(no content)Roo isn't an LLM model itself; it needs an LLM provider to work. But it's compatible with dozens of providers and hundreds of models, so you're free to experiment, optimize and switch around, by design. No lock-ins in a world where \"the best model\" changes every other week.\n\n## Key Features\n\n- It's built for multi-file edits, so it can read, refactor, and update multiple files at once for holistic code changes. Its agentic abilities go beyond a typical AI autocomplete, enabling it to run tests, open a browser, and handle deeper tasks.\n\n- Roo Code VS Code Extension works locally in your VS Code IDE and gives you full control over your coding experience. It's great for deep or highly iterative solo development work. It's highly customizable and fits into your existing workflow.\n\n- The extension is free forever and works with your choice of AI models through a bring-your-own-key approach.

It goes beyond simple autocompletion by reading and writing across multiple files, executing commands, and adapting to your workflow—like having a whole dev team right inside your editor.\n\n### Key Features & Capabilities\n\n**Specialized Modes:**\nRoo Code features distinct specialized modes (Code, Architect, Ask, Debug, and Orchestrator) that tailor the assistant's behavior and permissions for specific development tasks.(no content)Roo's Modes keep models focused on a given task and limit their access to tools which are relevant to their role, keeping the context window clearer and avoiding surprises. Modes are even smart enough to ask to switch to another when stepping outside their responsibilities.\n\n**Model Agnostic Architecture:**\nRoo Code is open-source and fully customizable, letting you integrate any AI model you choose (e.g, OpenAI, Anthropic, local LLMs, etc.).(no content)It works great with tens of models, from frontier to open weight. Choose from the curated selection offered at-cost or bring your own key.\n\n**Extensibility via MCP:**\nMCP (Model Context Protocol) allows Roo-Code to connect with external tools and services, such as databases or APIs. This framework enables you to integrate Roo-Code into your existing workflows and even create your own custom development tools.\n\n**Memory & Context Management:**\nFor maintaining project understanding over time, Roo-Code can be used with a Memory Bank to remember important details. You can also use context mentions (typing @) to include specific files, terminal output, or other relevant information directly in your prompts.\n\n**Boomerang Tasks:**\nThe Boomerang Tasks feature helps break down complex coding challenges into smaller, more manageable subtasks, allowing Roo-Code to handle intricate workflows more effectively.\n\n**File Operations & Code Generation:**\nRoo-Code possesses the capability to directly access and manipulate files within the user's project workspace. This includes generating new code, modifying existing files, and performing other file-related operations. When changes are made to files, Roo-Code conveniently displays diffs, allowing developers to easily review the proposed modifications before accepting them.\n\n**2025 Updates:**\nVersion 3.23 (July 10, 2025) introduced stable codebase indexing and a new todo list feature.\n\n**Additional Capabilities:**\nThe extension excels at multi-file edits, terminal command execution, browser automation for testing, and intelligent task coordination across development phases.\n\n**Security & Open Source:**\nThe Roo Code Extension is open source so you can see for yourself exactly what it's doing and they don't use your data for training. Plus they're fully SOC2 Type 2 compliant and follow industry-standard security practices.\n\n**Pricing:**\nThe core Roo Code extension is completely free and open-source. You only pay for any paid LLM usage (e.g., OpenAI API costs) if you choose those models.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"142071fa-65ff-4113-bd83-b7ecf3c213c1","timestamp":"2026-01-10T16:01:15.668Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Roo Code VS Code extension 2025 features capabilities","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01APvH5RbhBnNeRvjWx28QoT","content":[{"title":"Roo Code - Visual Studio Marketplace","url":"https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=RooVeterinaryInc.roo-cline"},{"title":"Installing Roo Code | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/getting-started/installing"},{"title":"Roo-Code: AI-Powered Autonomous Coding in VSCode - regolo.ai","url":"https://regolo.ai/roo-code-ai-powered-autonomous-coding-in-vscode/"},{"title":"Roo Code – The AI dev team that gets things done","url":"https://roocode.com/"},{"title":"Roo Code Docs | Roo Code Documentation","url":"https://docs.roocode.com/"},{"title":"Roo Code - AI-Powered Dev Team in VS Code","url":"https://roo-code.net/"},{"title":"Roo Code review: A perspective on AI-powered coding - Qubika","url":"https://qubika.com/blog/roo-code/"},{"title":"GitHub - qpd-v/Roo-Code: Roo Code (prev.

When changes are made to files, Roo-Code conveniently displays diffs, allowing developers to easily review the proposed modifications before accepting them.\n\n**2025 Updates:**\nVersion 3.23 (July 10, 2025) introduced stable codebase indexing and a new todo list feature.\n\n**Additional Capabilities:**\nThe extension excels at multi-file edits, terminal command execution, browser automation for testing, and intelligent task coordination across development phases.\n\n**Security & Open Source:**\nThe Roo Code Extension is open source so you can see for yourself exactly what it's doing and they don't use your data for training. Plus they're fully SOC2 Type 2 compliant and follow industry-standard security practices.\n\n**Pricing:**\nThe core Roo Code extension is completely free and open-source. You only pay for any paid LLM usage (e.g., OpenAI API costs) if you choose those models."],"durationSeconds":27.699705749996006}}

What is Roo Code?\n\nRoo Code is an **open-source, AI-powered autonomous coding agent** that runs as a VS Code extension. Originally forked from Cline (previously known as Roo Cline), it goes beyond simple code autocompletion by providing a full \"dev team\" of AI agents directly in your editor.\n\n**Core Capabilities:**\n- Read, write, and refactor code across multiple files simultaneously\n- Execute terminal commands directly from the IDE\n- Browser automation for testing workflows\n- Natural language interaction for code generation, debugging, and documentation\n- Direct file manipulation in your workspace\n- Permission-based control (you approve all changes)\n\n**Specialized Modes:**\n- **Code Mode**: Routine coding tasks\n- **Architect Mode**: System design and planning\n- **Ask Mode**: Q&A and explanations\n- **Debug Mode**: Issue resolution\n- **Orchestrator Mode**: Task coordination\n- **Custom Modes**: User-defined for specific workflows\n\n---\n\n### 2. How Does It Work? (Architecture & AI Models)\n\n**Architecture:**\n- Roo Code uses a **multi-agent, role-driven execution** model\n- Specialized modes limit tool access to keep agents focused on their specific responsibilities\n- Modes are intelligent enough to request switching when tasks fall outside their domain\n- Supports **MCP (Model Context Protocol)** for connecting to external tools, databases, and APIs\n- Includes **Memory Bank** for maintaining project context over time\n- **Boomerang Tasks** feature breaks complex challenges into manageable subtasks\n\n**AI Model Support:**\nRoo Code is **completely model-agnostic** - unlike Claude Code (locked to Anthropic) or Codex (locked to OpenAI):\n- Compatible with **dozens of providers and hundreds of models**\n- Supports: OpenAI, Anthropic (Claude), Google Gemini, local LLMs, OpenRouter, and any OpenAI-compatible API\n- Configuration profiles allow assigning different models to different modes (e.g., o3 for architecture, Claude Sonnet for coding)\n- **Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)** approach - you connect directly to providers\n\n---\n\n### 3. Pricing Model\n\n| Plan | Cost | Features |\n|------|------|----------|\n| **Extension (Core)** | Free forever | Full extension functionality, open-source |\n| **Cloud Free** | $0/month | Token tracking, task sharing, community support |\n| **Pro** | $20/month + $5/hr cloud tasks | Cloud agents (PR Reviewer), Roomote Control, paid support |\n| **Team** | $99/month + $5/hr cloud tasks | Unlimited members (no per-seat fees), shared settings, centralized billing |\n\n**Key Pricing Notes:**\n- The extension itself is completely free and open-source\n- You pay only for AI model API usage at provider rates (no markups)\n- Cloud agents cost $5/hour while running (infrastructure cost)\n- No subscription fees required to use the core extension\n\n---\n\n### 4. Key Strengths\n\n1. **Free and Open Source**: No subscription fees, fully transparent codebase, SOC2 Type 2 compliant\n2. **Model Flexibility**: Not locked to any provider; switch models as needed\n3. **Active Development**: Near-daily updates, responsive team, large Discord community\n4. **Privacy-Focused**: Code stays local unless you connect to external APIs; your data is not used for training\n5. **Deep IDE Integration**: Works within your existing VS Code setup with all familiar tools\n6. **Multi-file Operations**: Holistic code changes across entire projects\n7. **Permission-Based Control**: You approve all file changes and command executions\n8. **Extensible via MCP**: Connect to databases, APIs, and custom tools\n\n---\n\n### 5. Key Limitations\n\n1. **High Token Consumption**: Complex tasks can use millions of tokens; one test reported ~$50 USD for entities/CRUD/UI changes\n2. **Single Session per Window**: Cannot run parallel tasks in the same VS Code window\n3. **Context Loss on Model Switch**: Changing models mid-task causes context loss and potential rework\n4. **No Automatic Testing**: Does not run tests unless explicitly prompted\n5. **Large Repository Challenges**: Scaling across large codebases requires manual @file or @dir hints\n6. **Terminal Configuration**: May require configuration adjustments (especially on Windows with Git Bash)\n7. **Experimental Features**: VS Code Language Model API integration is highly experimental\n\n---\n\n### 6.
