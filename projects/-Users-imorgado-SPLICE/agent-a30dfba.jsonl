It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.\n\n### Key TrackItem Methods\n\nFrom the UXP API type definitions:\n\nTrackItems have methods including `isDisabled()` which returns true if the trackitem is muted/disabled, and `createSetDisabledAction(disabled: boolean)` which returns an action that enables/disables the trackItem.(no content)Additional trackItem methods include:\n- `createSetNameAction(inName: string)` - Returns an action that renames the trackItem\n- `getMediaType()` - Returns UUID representing the underlying media type\n- `getTrackIndex()` - Returns the track index of the track this item belongs to\n- `getProjectItem()` - Returns the project item for this track item\n\n### Audio TrackItem Specific Methods\n\n`getComponentChain()` returns an AudioComponentChain, and there are methods like `createInsertComponentAction()` and `createAppendComponentAction()` for managing components.\n\n### Getting TrackItems from Tracks\n\nTo access trackItems inside of a track, you need input parameters: `trackItemType` and `includeEmptyTrackItem` for the `getTrackItems` API.\n\n### Selection Methods\n\n`getSelection()` returns currently-selected clips as an Array of trackItems.

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.\n\n### Key TrackItem Methods\n\nFrom the UXP API type definitions:\n\nTrackItems have methods including `isDisabled()` which returns true if the trackitem is muted/disabled, and `createSetDisabledAction(disabled: boolean)` which returns an action that enables/disables the trackItem.(no content)Additional trackItem methods include:\n- `createSetNameAction(inName: string)` - Returns an action that renames the trackItem\n- `getMediaType()` - Returns UUID representing the underlying media type\n- `getTrackIndex()` - Returns the track index of the track this item belongs to\n- `getProjectItem()` - Returns the project item for this track item\n\n### Audio TrackItem Specific Methods\n\n`getComponentChain()` returns an AudioComponentChain, and there are methods like `createInsertComponentAction()` and `createAppendComponentAction()` for managing components.\n\n### Getting TrackItems from Tracks\n\nTo access trackItems inside of a track, you need input parameters: `trackItemType` and `includeEmptyTrackItem` for the `getTrackItems` API.\n\n### Selection Methods\n\n`getSelection()` returns currently-selected clips as an Array of trackItems. Combined with `app.bind`, developers can get real-time events of what the selected item is.\n\n### API Design Philosophy\n\nIn UXP, a method call is asynchronous and does not block the UI thread. For a smooth transition between the ExtendScript DOM and the UXP DOM, all properties (get and set) in the API were designed to be synchronous and do not need to be awaited.\n\n### Sequence Editor Methods\n\nThe SequenceEditor class allows you to duplicate trackItem using an insert or overwrite edit method to a destination track. Target track and start time of trackItem is determined using an offset value from the original trackItem position.\n\n### Current Limitations\n\nThere is no current API method (DOM, QE, CEP, or UXP) that can move an existing clip vertically between tracks.(no content)Additionally, the Caption API is still under construction, and there is no available API to access and modify caption properties yet.\n\nFor complete documentation, you can visit the official Adobe UXP for Premiere Pro documentation at [developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)."],"durationSeconds":25.940893958002327}}

The signature is:\n```typescript\ngetMarkers(markerOwnerObject: Sequence | ClipProjectItem): Promise<Markers>\n```\n\n### Related Actions\nYou can also use `createMoveMarkerAction(marker: Marker, tickTime: TickTime)` to move a marker to a new time value, and `createAddMarkerAction(Name: string, markerType?, startTime?, duration?, comments?)` to add a new marker.\n\n### Important Notes\n\nIn Premiere Pro, all markers and metadata associated with trackItems are actually attached to the backing projectItem; it's not possible to have different markers and metadata for each trackItem.(no content)As of November 2025, Premiere Pro has moved to extensibility based on UXP (Unified Extensibility Platform). ExtendScript-based integrations are still supported through September 2026.\n\n### Getting Started with UXP Development\n\nThe Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/(no content)To develop UXP plugins, you'll need the Premiere Pro BETA build and the UXP Developer Tool, both available through Creative Cloud Desktop.\n\n### Example Usage Pattern (Based on API Signatures)\n\n```javascript\n// Get the require function for ppro module\nconst { app } = require(\"ppro\");\n\nasync function getSequenceMarkers() {\n    // Get the active sequence\n    const sequence = await app.project.getActiveSequence();\n    \n    // Get markers for the sequence\n    const markers = await app.getMarkers(sequence);\n    \n    // Work with the markers object\n    // (iterate, read properties, etc.)\n}\n```\n\nTo see TypeScript definitions for the API, you can add typescript definitions to the .js file in which you are working.

Blue (Iris) would be Video with Audio. Purple (Violet) would be Video without Audio. It's purely for visual reference and has no impact on how the video is exported or anything like that.\n\n**Using Label Colors via Scripting:**\nFor projectItems, you can use getColorLabel() / setColorLabel(). Note: trackItems created from a projectItem will not have their label color updated; any new trackItems created from those projectItems, will get the updated label.(no content)app.project.rootItem.children[index].getColorLabel() retrieves the project item's color label.(no content)setColorLabel(labelColor) sets the project item's color label.\n\n**Label Color Sorting:**\nA more accurate description is that Premiere sorts labels by blue first, then green, then red. I figured this out from the new file format Premiere uses to save label color presets.\n\n**Classic vs. New Palette:**\nSettings > Labels > Label Color Presets > Classic will restore you to the label colors from previous versions of PPro.\n\n**Some Known Label Color Names:**\nBased on the search results, some of the 16 label colors mentioned include:\n- Violet (Video without Audio default)\n- Iris (Video with Audio default)\n- Lavender\n- Rose\n- Mango\n- Forest\n- Green\n- Cerulean\n- Yellow\n- Tan\n- Teal\n- Caribbean\n\nUnfortunately, the specific mapping of index values 0-16 to their exact color names is not well-documented in publicly available resources. Adobe's official scripting documentation doesn't appear to explicitly list these index-to-color mappings. You may need to test the `setColorLabel()` function with values 0-16 in ExtendScript to determine the exact mapping for your version of Premiere Pro.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"2ec8f171-a971-407d-9e29-d4a73c8f6124","timestamp":"2025-12-19T18:49:13.385Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro label color index values 0-16","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01MiutyjLR8HqtcZRzi3jZbr","content":[{"title":"Premiere label colours have a order? - Adobe Product Community - 14735546","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-label-colours-have-a-order/td-p/14735546"},{"title":"Set label preferences in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere/desktop/get-started/preferences-and-settings/labels-preferences.html"},{"title":"(Premiere) Why aren’t my unsynced clips colored?","url":"https://support.maxon.net/hc/en-us/articles/232058347--Premiere-Why-aren-t-my-unsynced-clips-colored"},{"title":"Premiere CC pro 2015 Label color problem - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/premiere-cc-pro-2015-label-color-problem/"},{"title":"Solved: Premiere Pro 22.4.0 Color Labels Gone & Problem - Adobe Product Community - 12939726","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-pro-22-4-0-color-labels-gone-amp-problem/td-p/12939726"},{"title":"Solved: All the Label Colours of Premiere Pro are changed ... - Adobe Product Community - 14643775","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/all-the-label-colours-of-premiere-pro-are-changed-into-darker/td-p/14643775"},{"title":"Live Updating Label Color & Clip Name - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/live-updating-label-color-clip-name/"},{"title":"Understanding the new label color and icons in the 2024 Adobe Premiere Pro update by Scott Simmons - ProVideo Coalition","url":"https://www.provideocoalition.com/understanding-the-new-label-color-and-icons-in-the-2024-adobe-premiere-pro-update/"},{"title":"Solved: Re: Label colors in Premiere Pro 2025 not function... - Adobe Product Community - 14956635","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/label-colors-in-premiere-pro-2025-not-functioning-as-normal/m-p/14956705"},{"title":"Re: Premiere label colours have a order? - Adobe Product Community - 14735546","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/premiere-label-colours-have-a-order/m-p/14736476"}]},"Based on my search, I found information about Premiere Pro label colors, but the results don't specifically list the exact index values 0-16 for label colors.

Adding Markers (Available in UXP)\n\n**Methods:**\n- `createAddMarkerAction(Name: string, markerType?: string, startTime?: TickTime, duration?: TickTime, comments?: string): Action` - Add markers with custom text\n- `getMarkers(filters?: string[]): Marker[]` - Retrieve existing markers\n- `createMoveMarkerAction(marker: Marker, tickTime: TickTime): Action` - Reposition markers\n\n**Important Limitation:** Markers are attached to the backing **ProjectItem**, not to individual trackItems. This means you cannot have different markers for different instances of the same clip on the timeline. All trackItems from the same source ProjectItem share the same markers.\n\n**Usage Pattern:**\n```javascript\nconst { app } = require(\"ppro\");\n\nasync function addMarkerToSequence() {\n    const sequence = await app.project.getActiveSequence();\n    const markers = await app.getMarkers(sequence);\n    \n    // Create marker action\n    const tickTime = /* your time in ticks */;\n    const action = markers.createAddMarkerAction(\n        \"Take 2 - Best\",      // Name\n        \"Comment\",            // markerType\n        tickTime,             // startTime\n        0,                    // duration (0 for point marker)\n        \"Selected as best take\" // comments\n    );\n    \n    // Execute with transaction\n    await app.lockedAccess(async () => {\n        await app.executeTransaction(action);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Changing Label Colors (Available in UXP)\n\n**Methods on ProjectItem:**\n- `createSetColorLabelAction(inColorLabelIndex: number): Action` - Set color by index\n- `getColorLabelIndex(): Promise<number>` - Get current color index\n\n**Important Limitation:** You can only change the label color of **ProjectItems**, not trackItems directly. Existing trackItems on the timeline will NOT update their colors - only NEW trackItems created from the modified ProjectItem will show the new color.\n\n**Color Index Values:** Premiere Pro has 16 label colors (indices 0-15). The exact color names vary by version but include colors like Violet, Iris, Lavender, Rose, Mango, Forest, Green, Cerulean, Yellow, Tan, Teal, Caribbean, etc.\n\n**Usage Pattern:**\n```javascript\nconst { app } = require(\"ppro\");\n\nasync function setProjectItemColor(projectItem, colorIndex) {\n    const action = projectItem.createSetColorLabelAction(colorIndex);\n    await app.lockedAccess(async () => {\n        await app.executeTransaction(action);\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Renaming TrackItems (Available in UXP)\n\nAccording to the TypeScript definitions, there IS a method for renaming trackItems:\n- `createSetNameAction(inName: string): Action` - Returns an action that renames the trackItem\n\nThis may work for your use case to label clips with take numbers.\n\n### Practical Recommendations for SPLICE\n\nGiven your goal of visually marking different takes on the timeline:\n\n1. **Sequence Markers** - Add markers to the sequence at each take's position with take numbers and ratings in the marker name/comments. This is visible in the timeline and does not depend on individual clips.\n\n2. **TrackItem Renaming** - Try using `createSetNameAction()` on the trackItems to rename them with take information.\n\n3. **ProjectItem Color Labels** - Less useful for your case since colors only apply to new clips, not existing timeline clips.\n\n### Sources\n\n- [The Premiere UXP API](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Markers Class Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/markers/)\n- [ProjectItem Class Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/projectitem/)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro TypeScript Definitions](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)\n- [Adobe UXP Premiere Pro Samples](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [UXP Razor Tool and Marking Discussion](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-razor-tool-and-marking-clipped-sections/td-p/15547922)\n- [Set Label Preferences in Premiere Pro](https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere/desktop/get-started/preferences-and-settings/labels-preferences.html)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4478,"cache_read_input_tokens":18332,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4478,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGYeeNdpVwQkC1zg1LUo","type":"assistant","uuid":"a05a61eb-a642-40ba-801b-a006c80fae26","timestamp":"2025-12-19T18:49:40.531Z"}
