It optimizes your workflow by automatically cutting out bad takes, silent moments, filler words, and background noise, ensuring your content is polished and engaging.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### AI-Powered Editing\n- AI-Powered Editing automatically detects and removes bad takes, silences, and filler words, significantly reducing editing time. The AI Text-Based Trimmer lets you edit videos by modifying the transcribed text, providing a seamless and intuitive editing experience.\n- AI Captions & Subtitles automatically generate accurate captions and subtitles, enhancing accessibility and engagement. Noise Removal eliminates background noise to ensure clear and professional audio quality.\n\n### Text-Based Editing\nWhat sets Gling apart is its innovative text-based editing interface that transforms video editing into a process as simple as editing a Google Doc. Instead of scrubbing through timelines and manually cutting footage, creators can review an automatically generated transcript and delete unwanted sections by simply removing lines of text. This approach makes professional video editing accessible even to those without technical editing skills.\n\n### Integrations\nGling seamlessly integrates with popular editors like Final Cut Pro, DaVinci Resolve, and Adobe Premiere. Alternatively, you can export directly to MP4 or MP3 media files, accompanied by captions in SRT format.\n\n### Additional Features\n- Gling includes a text-based editor, captions, subtitles, automatic zooms, background noise reduction, and a chapter and title generator for enhancing organic reach.\n- Auto-generated timestamps break your video into chapters, making it easier for viewers to quickly find the parts they want to watch.\n\n## Pricing (2025)\n\nGling offers three pricing tiers:\n- **Free Plan ($0/month):** 1 hour of media processed per month, unlimited video export with watermark, basic editing features without premium support.\n- **Plus Plan ($20/month):** Up to 10 hours of media processed per month, unlimited video export without watermark, access to all AI editing features, no premium support.\n- **Pro Plan ($40/month):** Up to 30 hours of media processed per month, unlimited video export without watermark, premium support included, full access to all AI editing features.(no content)Paid plans start at $20/month with a 50% annual discount available.\n\n## Time Savings\nFor YouTubers who spend more than 2-3 hours per week editing talking-head videos, Gling AI easily justifies its $20/month price tag. The time savings (5-10x faster editing) means you can produce more content or focus on other aspects of your channel.\n\n## Limitations\n- Currently, Gling AI only supports English language content, which is its biggest limitation. The developers have acknowledged this constraint, but there's no confirmed timeline for multi-language support.\n- Gling AI is specifically designed for talking-head videos and isn't suitable for complex productions with multiple scenes, B-roll footage, or creative transitions. It excels at cleaning up single or multi-camera talking-head content but lacks advanced editing features.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"1c0a66b8-b425-4b12-b85a-0cf667dc9e98","timestamp":"2025-12-26T06:55:45.749Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Gling AI YouTube video editing features pricing 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01YUXVWAFKaABJQhGgc1rr8E","content":[{"title":"Gling - AI Video Editing Software for YouTube","url":"https://www.gling.ai"},{"title":"Gling AI Review 2025: Edit YouTube Videos 10x Faster?","url":"https://max-productive.ai/ai-tools/gling/"},{"title":"Gling AI Review: Edit YouTube Videos 10x Faster in 2025?","url":"https://www.fahimai.com/gling-ai"},{"title":"Gling Pricing, Alternatives & More 2025 | Capterra","url":"https://www.capterra.com/p/10003793/Gling/"},{"title":"Video Editing","url":"https://www.gling.ai/video-editing"},{"title":"Gling AI: The Video Editing Software for Talking-Head YouTubers {Review}","url":"https://creatingwithkaya.com/gling-ai-video-editing-review/"},{"title":"Gling AI Review – Cost, Use Cases & Alternatives [2025]","url":"https://aichief.com/ai-video-tools/gling-ai/"},{"title":"Gling Review: Features, Pricing, and Alternatives 2025","url":"https://findmyaitool.io/tool/gling/"},{"title":"How To Master Video Editing for YouTube (in 2025)","url":"https://www.gling.ai/blog/video-editing"},{"title":"Gling AI Reviews, Alternatives, and Pricing updated December 2025","url":"https://opentools.ai/tools/gling-ai"}]},"Based on my search results, here's a comprehensive overview of Gling AI's YouTube video editing features and pricing for 2025:\n\n## Gling AI Overview\n\nGling's AI video editing software is designed for YouTube creators.

Unlike traditional editing tools, Descript transcribes your videos and links the text to corresponding video segments, making it incredibly easy to edit videos and audio files.(no content)In Descript you can make any video you want, any way you want. All you need is an idea. With the world's first AI co-editor, Underlord, you can make a video just by describing your vision. It will create, edit, and design your video—all under your direction.\n\n## Key Features\n\n### Text-Based Editing\nDescript is an AI-powered podcast and video editor that blends video editing with transcript-based tools. Instead of only working on a timeline, it lets you edit directly through text.\n\n### AI-Powered Tools\n- **Overdub / AI Voice Cloning**: Fix mistakes without re-recording. Type the corrected word, and the AI generates the new audio in your own voice.\n- **Filler Word Removal**: Automatically detects words like \"um,\" \"uh,\" and \"you know,\" and removes them in bulk.\n- **Studio Sound**: Instantly improve audio quality of any recording with one click – remove background noise, enhance speech, and get studio-quality sound without a professional setup.\n- **Green Screen**: Instantly remove the background from any video without the need for a physical green screen or complicated chroma key editing.\n- **Eye Contact**: AI subtly adjusts your gaze so it appears that you are looking directly into the camera.\n\n### Additional Capabilities\n- Screen and webcam recording for tutorials and presentations.\n- Automatically create animated captions for your videos. Choose from stock caption styles or customize the font, colors, word highlighting, and positioning.\n- With Descript's AI video, you can create bespoke B-roll, whole scenes, avatars, voice clones, and more.\n- You can comment, share projects, and co-edit in real time — much like Google Docs. This makes it ideal for distributed teams or clients who want to leave feedback on specific timestamps.\n\n### New in 2025\nDescript has expanded its stock voice library to include 21 new voices with improved usability, providing a wider range of voice options to fit various creative needs, from casual to corporate tones.(no content)AI Actions enable users to repurpose their content efficiently.\n\n## Pricing Plans (2025)\n\n**Free Plan**: Serves as an entry point, offering basic editing features, transcription, screen recording, templates, and stock media. Users get 1 hour of transcription and remote recording per month. However, video export resolution is capped at 720p, and cloud storage is limited to 5GB.(no content)**Hobbyist Plan**: $24 per user each month, or $192 per user annually.(no content)**Creator Plan**: Costs $15 per user/month or $12 per user/month ($144 billed annually).(no content)**Business Plan**: $65 per user each month, or $600 per user annually (built for larger teams).(no content)**Education/Non-profit Plan**: $5 per user per month for non-profit organizations and accredited educational institutions' members. This plan includes the same features as the Creator Plan, such as advanced editing, Overdub, and screen recording, with a monthly transcription limit of 4 hours.\n\n### Usage Tracking\nMedia Hours refer to the number of hours of video or audio you can upload and process each month. AI Credits are used to power Descript's AI tools like Overdub, Remove Filler Words, Studio Sound, AI video generation, and custom voice cloning. Unused credits and hours do not roll over, but you can purchase top-ups if you exceed your monthly allowance.\n\n## What Makes Descript Special?\n\n1. For most projects, users are able to cut editing time by 60–70% compared to tools like Final Cut or Adobe Audition.\n\n2. \"If you can edit text, you can edit video with Descript.\" It's loaded with automated design tools, plus a friendly timeline editor, a built-in recorder, and hosted publishing that makes collaboration as easy as sending a link.\n\n3. AI video editing agents automatically remove filler words and awkward pauses, making the final cut sound polished without requiring hours working in the timeline.\n\n## Limitations to Consider\n\nIf your workflow involves advanced transitions, overlays, animations, or heavy color grading, Descript isn't the right tool. It's perfect for rough cuts, talking-head videos, and podcasts — but not for polished cinematic production.(no content)Once your project gets over an hour long or if you're using multiple tracks with effects, the app can start to lag or even crash.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"0d5378fa-fff7-407c-b719-61a846611e6d","timestamp":"2025-12-26T06:56:00.370Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Descript video editing features pricing what makes it special 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_019VJrouypuDc7xVqPgdXgQ1","content":[{"title":"Pricing & Plans | Descript","url":"https://www.descript.com/pricing"},{"title":"Descript Pricing: Is It Worth It in 2025? | Jamie","url":"https://www.meetjamie.ai/blog/descript-pricing"},{"title":"Descript Pricing 2025: Plans, Costs & Features Reviewed - Tekpon","url":"https://tekpon.com/software/descript/pricing/"},{"title":"A complete guide to Descript pricing in 2025 - eesel AI","url":"https://www.eesel.ai/blog/descript-pricing"},{"title":"Descript AI Review 2025: Features, Pricing, and Real Results After 100+ Hours of Use - Fritz ai","url":"https://fritz.ai/descript-ai-review/"},{"title":"Descript Pricing 2025","url":"https://www.g2.com/products/descript/pricing"},{"title":"Descript Review 2025: AI Video Editor Features, Pros, Cons & Filmora Alternative","url":"https://filmora.wondershare.com/video-editor-review/descript-ai.html"},{"title":"Descript Reviews 2025: Details, Pricing, & Features | G2","url":"https://www.g2.com/products/descript/reviews"},{"title":"Descript pricing overhaul — media minutes, AI credits & top-ups explained","url":"https://cotovan.com/post/descript-pricing-media-minutes-ai-credits-topups/"},{"title":"Descript AI Review 2025: Features, Pricing, Pros & Cons","url":"https://www.allaboutai.com/ai-reviews/descript-ai/"}]},"# Descript Video Editing: Features, Pricing & What Makes It Special in 2025\n\n## What is Descript?\n\nDescript is a revolutionary video and audio editing software that leverages cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology to simplify the editing process.

This frustrating issue usually comes from compatibility or installation glitches.\n\n### Crashes and Stability Issues\nSometimes AutoPod crashes mid-edit or messes up meticulously cut clips.(no content)Outdated software versions often lead to instability.\n\n### Social Clip Creator Problems\nAfter editing with multiple camera sources and mics, setting In and Out points for a vertical clip (1080×1920) results in the generator creating a new sequence of the entire length, ignoring marker points and using only the first video track.(no content)AutoPod has acknowledged this issue, attributing it to the latest Premiere Pro update (version 24.3.0 BETA).\n\n### Inconsistent Camera Switching\nIn simpler podcast layouts (e.g., one camera, two lavalier mics), Autopod often performs inconsistent automatic cuts. This can be a time killer in podcast video editing.(no content)Autopod assumes one mic = one angle.

This frustrating issue usually comes from compatibility or installation glitches.\n\n### Crashes and Stability Issues\nSometimes AutoPod crashes mid-edit or messes up meticulously cut clips.(no content)Outdated software versions often lead to instability.\n\n### Social Clip Creator Problems\nAfter editing with multiple camera sources and mics, setting In and Out points for a vertical clip (1080×1920) results in the generator creating a new sequence of the entire length, ignoring marker points and using only the first video track.(no content)AutoPod has acknowledged this issue, attributing it to the latest Premiere Pro update (version 24.3.0 BETA).\n\n### Inconsistent Camera Switching\nIn simpler podcast layouts (e.g., one camera, two lavalier mics), Autopod often performs inconsistent automatic cuts. This can be a time killer in podcast video editing.(no content)Autopod assumes one mic = one angle. When that math breaks, so does switching logic.\n\n### Complexity with Larger Projects\nAutopod is popular because it instantly creates talking-head sequences and handles simple switching. However, when projects become more complex (with multiple guests, long runtimes, and short-form repurposing), small errors compound quickly.\n\n### Workaround Suggestions\nFor some sync issues, users suggest lining up the start of the video and audio to start at 0:00 and trimming the ending with both video and audio to match its endpoints.

Autosave helps, but saving often is a must.\n- Descript is resource-intensive and unreliable, with frequent crashes and glitches that interrupt creative flow.\n\n### Buggy Software\n- \"Descript Rooms\" is noted as being \"so buggy.\" The tool is frequently described as having \"problems\" and being \"broken,\" particularly with new AI features.\n- \"There are far too many bugs for it to be useful. I'm not exaggerating when I say that I have to deal with multiple BIG problems every day.\"\n- A significant complaint is that Descript ships \"half-baked\" AI features that do not work as advertised. The company is perceived as constantly adding features but often introducing new problems or not fully resolving existing ones.\n\n### Learning Curve\n- Since the platform is feature-heavy, it's not easy to learn quickly.\n- Despite all that eventual ease of use, users are struggling with initial adoption. The learning curve hits hard at first with complexity concerns and general learning challenges. It's like Descript is too different from what people expect.\n\n### Limitations\n- Recording hours are limited monthly according to the plan you're on. The free plan only gets 1 hour of transcription per month, watermarked 720p exports, and restricted AI access.\n- One limitation of Descript is the absence of a mobile app for video editing on the go.\n- \"Despite claims of lossless quality, I found significant compression issues. For instance, a 500 MB file was reduced to 23 MB, compromising the video quality significantly.\"\n- Creators also report struggles with accent recognition, no mobile editing app, compression issues, and lackluster customer support.\n\n### Customer Service Issues\n- Poor customer service is a common complaint. Users report difficulty canceling accounts easily.\n- One user described reaching out to senior leadership on LinkedIn only to be met with \"total, deafening silence,\" claiming the company has \"ZERO respect for its customers.\"\n\n### Transcription Quality\n- Unreliable transcription accuracy and finicky speaker labeling hamper its potential.\n- Although the automatic version has a transcribing accuracy of roughly 95%, there are still grammatical problems. It takes longer than expected to look over transcriptions and revise them.\n\n### Pricing Concerns\n- Some users feel the AI features are \"disproportionately expensive\" with \"no justification for how much they are charging.\"\n\n### Not Suitable for Professional Video Editing\n- If you're expecting pro-level video editing or buttery-smooth performance, temper your expectations.\n- If your daily editing needs include multi-cam shoots, layered timelines, color grading, and intricate motion graphics, Descript's stripped-back editor will feel confining. Advanced audio routing, VFX, and frame-by-frame control are either limited or missing.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"4b036d13-9b7d-495e-83a6-eb214b428c95","timestamp":"2025-12-26T06:57:26.087Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Descript user complaints problems limitations Reddit 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01NFxdWr72nC1zbdhoxquKtP","content":[{"title":"Descript Review (2025): Genius Tool or Overhyped Frustration?","url":"https://workfromyourlaptop.com/descript-review/"},{"title":"9 Best Descript Alternatives and Competitors for Creators in 2026","url":"https://riverside.com/blog/descript-alternatives"},{"title":"Descript Review 2025 - Reddit Sentiment, Alternatives & More","url":"https://www.toksta.com/products/descript"},{"title":"Descript Review 2025: Text-Based Video Editing & More","url":"https://www.vidmetoo.com/descript-review/"},{"title":"An honest look at Descript reviews in 2025: Is it the right AI editor for you? - eesel AI","url":"https://www.eesel.ai/blog/descript-reviews"},{"title":"Descript Review 2025: Worth Buying Or Not?

Key Differentiators to Market\n\n1. **\"Zero-manual-step\" workflow** - No export/import cycle like Descript/Gling/TimeBolt\n2. **Frame-perfect precision** - RMS + frame alignment vs transcript-based guessing\n3. **Professional NLE integration** - Works with existing Premiere workflow\n4. **All-in-one solution** - Silences + takes + multitrack + zoom + chapters in one plugin\n5. **Transparent pricing** - No hidden credit traps like OpusClip\n\n---\n\nThis analysis shows SPLICE is well-positioned with unique technical advantages (RMS detection, DOM API speed, native UXP integration) but could benefit from adding AI B-roll, social clip repurposing, and one-click audio enhancement to match competitor feature parity."}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":1168,"cache_creation_input_tokens":2483,"cache_read_input_tokens":31711,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":2483,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWUs5pFYauyFSpzb7fepr","type":"assistant","uuid":"130bca1c-0613-4fe1-911c-72cd658346d7","timestamp":"2025-12-26T06:59:15.669Z"}
