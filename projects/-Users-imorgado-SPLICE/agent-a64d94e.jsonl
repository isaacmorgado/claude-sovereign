The `lockedAccess` method gets a read/upgrade locked access to the Project, ensuring the project state will not change during the execution of the callback function. You can call `executeTransaction` while having locked access.(no content)The `createSetNameAction(inName: string)` method returns an Action that renames the trackItem. This is available on both VideoClipTrackItem and AudioClipTrackItem objects.\n\n### Example Code Pattern\n\nBased on the community examples, here's the pattern for renaming a trackItem:\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"premierepro\");\n\nasync function renameTrackItem() {\n    try {\n        const project = await app.Project.getActiveProject();\n        const mainSequence = await project.getActiveSequence();\n        \n        // Get video tracks and find a track item\n        const videoTracks = await mainSequence.getVideoTracks();\n        const firstTrack = videoTracks[0];\n        const trackItems = firstTrack.getTrackItems(\n            app.Constants.TrackItemType.CLIP, \n            false\n        );\n        \n        if (trackItems.length > 0) {\n            const trackItem = trackItems[0];\n            \n            // Use lockedAccess and executeTransaction to rename\n            project.lockedAccess(() => {\n                project.executeTransaction((compoundAction) => {\n                    const renameAction = trackItem.createSetNameAction(\"New Clip Name\");\n                    compoundAction.addAction(renameAction);\n                }, \"Rename Track Item\");\n            });\n        }\n    } catch (err) {\n        console.error(\"Error:\", err);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points\n\n`lockedAccess` and `executeTransaction` are essential for making changes to the project. Users have confirmed that using these methods together is necessary for actions like `createInsertProjectItemAction` and `createAddMarkerAction` to work properly.(no content)Note that there was a forum discussion from May 2025 where a user couldn't find documentation for renaming videotrack clip items in UXP, but the `createSetNameAction` method that \"returns an action that renames the trackItem\" is documented in the VideoClipTrackItem API (available since version 25.0).\n\n### Resources\n\n- The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/\n- The 'premiere_api' UXP example plugin is the right starting point for any future integrations and shows how to clone and remove track items.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"27a03dc3-d3e6-435b-be0d-8c2fc5b56a43","timestamp":"2025-12-19T18:48:49.349Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"\"Premiere Pro\" UXP \"lockedAccess\" \"executeTransaction\" example rename trackItem","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_014N2RtfzrdxEcZYqF6kYqqo","content":[{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Premiere UXP - Basic methods - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/premiere-uxp-basic-methods/10276"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"Premiere Pro UXP | Unable to rename clips? - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/premiere-pro-uxp-unable-to-rename-clips/10924"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/"},{"title":"Request for Timeline Editing API Support (Clip Tra... - Adobe Product Community - 15624626","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-ideas/request-for-timeline-editing-api-support-clip-track-movement-flattening/idc-p/15625115"},{"title":"Understanding UXP APIs","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/resources/fundamentals/apis/"},{"title":"Update of UXP APIs inside of Premiere Pro - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/update-of-uxp-apis-inside-of-premiere-pro/10384"},{"title":"UXP - Now Available in Premiere Pro Beta! - Premiere Pro - Adobe Creative Cloud Developer Forums","url":"https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/uxp-now-available-in-premiere-pro-beta/8795"},{"title":"Issue Accessing Caption Items via CaptionTrack API in Premiere Pro UXP Scripting","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/issue-accessing-caption-items-via-captiontrack-api-in-premiere-pro-uxp-scripting/td-p/15432460"}]},"The initial search didn't return specific results for `lockedAccess` and `executeTransaction`.

It is powered by a modern JavaScript engine and offers the ability to access many Premiere functions at a programmatic level.\n\n- UXP is the current extensibility standard for Adobe Creative Cloud applications, supported by a constantly growing set of applications, including Premiere (version 25.6), Photoshop, and InDesign.\n\n- An important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while they were executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous, and does not block the UI thread.\n\nThe direct documentation for the VideoClipTrackItem class can be found at: https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/videocliptrackitem/\n\nHowever, the specific `createSetNameAction` method details were not included in the search snippet.

Both `VideoClipTrackItem` and `AudioClipTrackItem` have the method:\n\n```javascript\ncreateSetNameAction(inName: string): Action\n// Returns an action that renames the trackItem\n```\n\nThis method is available since Premiere Pro version 25.0.\n\n## How to Execute the Rename Action\n\nYou must use `lockedAccess` and `executeTransaction` together to execute the action:\n\n```javascript\nconst app = require(\"premierepro\");\n\nasync function renameTrackItem(trackItem, newName) {\n    try {\n        const project = await app.Project.getActiveProject();\n        \n        // Use lockedAccess and executeTransaction to rename\n        project.lockedAccess(() => {\n            project.executeTransaction((compoundAction) => {\n                const renameAction = trackItem.createSetNameAction(newName);\n                compoundAction.addAction(renameAction);\n            }, \"Rename Clip\"); // Optional undo string\n        });\n    } catch (err) {\n        console.error(\"Error renaming clip:\", err);\n    }\n}\n```\n\n## Key Points\n\n1. **Why setting `projectItem.name` does not work**: Setting the name on the project item only changes the source item in the Project panel. When multiple clips on the timeline share the same source footage, you need to rename the individual TrackItem, not the underlying ProjectItem.\n\n2. **Action-based pattern**: UXP uses immutable action objects that integrate with Premiere's undo/redo system. You create an action, add it to a compound action, then execute it via a transaction.\n\n3. **`lockedAccess` is required**: This ensures the project state does not change during the execution of your callback. You can call `executeTransaction` while having locked access.\n\n4. **Asynchronous execution**: Unlike ExtendScript/CEP which was synchronous and blocked the UI, UXP method calls are asynchronous and do not block the UI thread.\n\n## Historical Note\n\nThere was a forum discussion from May-June 2025 where developers noted that `getName` existed but `setName` was missing. Adobe confirmed that `createSetNameAction` would be included in an update. The method is now available in the current UXP API (version 25.0+).\n\n## Sources\n\n- [VideoClipTrackItem - Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/videocliptrackitem/)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro types.d.ts - GitHub](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)\n- [Premiere Pro UXP - Unable to rename clips? - Adobe Developer Forums](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/premiere-pro-uxp-unable-to-rename-clips/10924)\n- [Adobe UXP Premiere Pro Samples - GitHub](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [The Premiere UXP API - Adobe Developer](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":912,"cache_read_input_tokens":19328,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":912,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGYezdJ1cEYu9ey9jDWS","type":"assistant","uuid":"4942e69b-9372-4ad2-8cfa-ce31dfbc6020","timestamp":"2025-12-19T18:49:38.594Z"}
