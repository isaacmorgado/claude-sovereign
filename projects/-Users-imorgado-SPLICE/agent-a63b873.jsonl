You can also use `createMoveMarkerAction(marker: Marker, tickTime: TickTime)` to move a marker to a new time value, and `createAddMarkerAction()` to add new markers.\n\n## UXP API for Metadata\n\nFor metadata operations, the UXP API provides `createSetProjectMetadataAction(projectItem: ProjectItem, metadata: string, updatedFields: string[])` for setting project metadata, `createSetXMPMetadataAction(projectItem: ProjectItem, metadata: string)` for setting XMP metadata, `addPropertyToProjectMetadataSchema(name: string, label: string, type: number)` to add properties to the project metadata schema, and `getProjectColumnsMetadata(projectItem: ProjectItem)` to get project column metadata from a project item.\n\n## Important Limitation\n\n\"In PPro, all markers and metadata associated with trackItems, are actually attached to the backing projectItem; it's not possible to have different markers and metadata for each trackItem.\"(no content)Each projectItem has XMP metadata which includes markers, and width/height info is included in that.\n\n## Markers Panel in Premiere Pro\n\nThe Markers panel (Window > Markers) allows you to view and manage all markers in an open clip or sequence. You can double-click a marker to view its properties in detail.\n\n## Write Clip Markers to XMP\n\nThere's a preference setting called \"Write clip markers to XMP\" hiding in the preference panel under the \"Media\" tab. This is considered one of the most important features added to Premiere because it addresses backup, archive, project sharing, and helps with online/offline workflows.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"44f7008f-8ce5-4a33-bfce-0705b974814c","timestamp":"2025-12-19T18:49:47.800Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro UXP clip label color metadata marker","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01Pw5f2qadiUnoVMgcZPqwqp","content":[{"title":"uxp-premiere-pro/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts"},{"title":"Markers overview in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere/desktop/organize-media/apply-labeling/overview-of-markers.html"},{"title":"Solved: UXP: Razor tool and marking clipped sections - Adobe Product Community - 15547922","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-razor-tool-and-marking-clipped-sections/td-p/15547922"},{"title":"Quick way to Label clips? - Adobe Premiere Pro - Creative COW","url":"https://creativecow.net/forums/thread/quick-way-to-label-clipsae/"},{"title":"How to Label Clips in Premiere Pro (5 Quick Tips) | Envato Tuts+","url":"https://photography.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-label-clips-in-premiere-pro-5-quick-tips--cms-107801"},{"title":"Quick Tip: Using Label Colors to Manage Premiere Pro Projects","url":"https://www.premiumbeat.com/blog/using-clip-colors-premiere-pro/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Clip Markers – Solved!","url":"https://www.creativeimpatience.com/premiere-pro-clip-markers-solved/"},{"title":"Using Adobe Premiere Pro Markers to Organize and Label Key Moments in Video | Noble Desktop","url":"https://www.nobledesktop.com/learn/premiere-pro/using-adobe-premiere-pro-markers-to-organize-and-label-key-moments-in-video"},{"title":"UXP: How to read clip markers and cut timeline ite... - Adobe Product Community - 15510061","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-how-to-read-clip-markers-and-cut-timeline-items-at-those-positions/td-p/15510061"},{"title":"Set label preferences in Premiere Pro","url":"https://helpx.adobe.com/premiere/desktop/get-started/preferences-and-settings/labels-preferences.html"}]},"Here's what I found regarding Premiere Pro UXP APIs for clip labels, color, metadata, and markers:\n\n## UXP API for Labels and Colors\n\nThe Premiere Pro UXP API provides methods for working with clip label colors, including `getColorLabelIndex()` which returns a Promise<number> to get the color label index of a projectItem, and `createSetColorLabelAction(inColorLabelIndex: number)` which creates an action for setting a color label to a projectItem by index.\n\n## UXP API for Markers\n\nThe API includes `getMarkers(markerOwnerObject: Sequence | ClipProjectItem)` which returns the Markers object for a Sequence or ProjectItem.

Here's what I can tell you:\n\n## createSetColorLabelAction in Premiere Pro UXP\n\nThe `createSetColorLabelAction(inColorLabelIndex: number): Action` method is used to create an action for setting a color label to a projectItem by index.(no content)This method is available on ProjectItem objects (including FolderItem or ClipProjectItem cast to ProjectItem) and can be used to create an action for setting color labels.\n\n### API Context\n\nAn important difference between ExtendScript (and CEP) and UXP in Premiere is that all ExtendScript calls to Premiere were synchronous, meaning they blocked the Premiere UI while executing. In UXP, a method call is asynchronous and does not block the UI thread.\n\n### How to Use (General Pattern)\n\nBased on the TypeScript definitions found in the UXP documentation, here's how you would typically use this method:\n\n```javascript\nconst { app } = require(\"premierepro\");\n\n// Get the active project and a project item\nconst project = await app.getActiveProject();\nconst rootItem = await project.getRootItem();\nconst children = await rootItem.getChildren();\nconst projectItem = children[0]; // Get first project item\n\n// Create the color label action (color index 0-16)\nconst setColorAction = projectItem.createSetColorLabelAction(3); // e.g., index 3 for a specific color\n\n// Execute the action\nawait setColorAction.execute();\n```\n\n### Resources for More Examples\n\nAdobe provides sample UXP plugins for Premiere Pro development. The Premiere Pro UXP API documentation is available at https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/.(no content)Adobe has updated their sample code in the Sample SDK, which provides practical examples of how to interact with the Premiere API using UXP.\n\nFor complete working examples, I recommend checking:\n- The [UXP Premiere Pro Samples repository](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- The [official Premiere UXP API documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/projectitem/)\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"c2d729da-e7d5-460a-9091-6a87e275390a","timestamp":"2025-12-19T18:50:38.719Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"Premiere Pro UXP createSetColorLabelAction example code","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01NM3jwU1JkoroRQ3UUwL2UV","content":[{"title":"uxp-premiere-pro/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts"},{"title":"GitHub - AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples"},{"title":"The Premiere UXP API","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/"},{"title":"Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/"},{"title":"Premiere API—UXP for Adobe Premiere","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/"},{"title":"uxp-premiere-pro-samples/README.md at main · AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples","url":"https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples/blob/main/README.md"},{"title":"UXP Arrives in Premiere: A New Era for Plugin Development","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2025/12/uxp-arrives-in-premiere-a-new-era-for-plugin-development"},{"title":"ProjectItem","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/projectitem/"},{"title":"Offline Docs - Premiere Pro Scripting Guide","url":"https://ppro-scripting.docsforadobe.dev/print_page/"},{"title":"Building your first UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/"}]},"Based on my search results, I found information about the `createSetColorLabelAction` method in Premiere Pro's UXP API, though I didn't find a complete example code snippet.

Let me compile a summary of the findings.\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Premiere Pro UXP API for Modifying Clip Properties\n\nBased on my research, here are the key findings for working with clips on the timeline in Premiere Pro UXP:\n\n### Renaming Clips on the Timeline\n\nThe official Adobe sample code shows the pattern for renaming track items:\n\n```typescript\nexport async function renameFirstSelectedTrackItem(\n    project: Project,\n    sequence: Sequence\n) {\n    const selection = await sequence.getSelection();\n    const items = await selection.getTrackItems();\n    if (items.length == 0) {\n        log(\"No trackItem is selected for rename\");\n        return false;\n    }\n    let success = false;\n    try {\n        project.lockedAccess(() => {\n            const renameAction = items[0].createSetNameAction(\"TrackItem 1\");\n            success = project.executeTransaction((compoundAction) => {\n                compoundAction.addAction(renameAction);\n            }, \"rename trackItem to TrackItem 1\");\n        });\n    } catch (error) {\n        log(error, \"red\");\n    }\n    return success;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Methods for Track Items (VideoClipTrackItem / AudioClipTrackItem)\n\n| Method | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `createSetNameAction(inName: string)` | Returns an action that renames the trackItem |\n| `getName()` | Returns display name for trackItem (Promise) |\n| `getMatchName()` | Returns internal matchname value (Promise) |\n| `createSetDisabledAction(disabled: boolean)` | Enable/disable items |\n| `createSetInPointAction()` / `createSetOutPointAction()` | Modify media in/out points |\n| `createSetStartAction()` / `createSetEndAction()` | Modify sequence timing |\n| `createMoveAction()` | Shift item by time offset |\n\n### Key Methods for Project Items\n\n| Method | Description |\n|--------|-------------|\n| `createSetNameAction(inName: string)` | Renames the projectItem |\n| `createSetColorLabelAction(inColorLabelIndex: number)` | Sets color label by index (0-16) |\n| `getColorLabelIndex()` | Gets current color label index |\n\n### Setting Marker Colors\n\n```typescript\nasync function setFirstSequenceMarkerColor(project, sequence) {\n    const markers = await getMarkerObjects(sequence);\n    // Change the first marker's color to blue\n    project.lockedAccess(() => {\n        const colorAction = markers[0].createSetColorAction(Constants.MarkerColor.Blue);\n        project.executeTransaction((compoundAction) => {\n            compoundAction.addAction(colorAction);\n        }, \"set marker color\");\n    });\n}\n```\n\n### Important Pattern: lockedAccess + executeTransaction\n\nAll modifications in UXP must follow this pattern:\n1. **`project.lockedAccess(callback)`** - Ensures project state doesn't change during execution\n2. **`project.executeTransaction(callback, description)`** - Creates an undoable action\n3. **`compoundAction.addAction(action)`** - Adds individual actions to the transaction\n\n### Important Limitation\n\n**Track items do not have their own color labels or metadata** - In Premiere Pro, markers and metadata associated with trackItems are actually attached to the backing projectItem. You cannot have different markers and metadata for each trackItem.\n\n### Sources\n\n- [AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples (GitHub)](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro-samples)\n- [Premiere UXP API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/)\n- [Premiere API Reference](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/)\n- [UXP Premiere Pro TypeScript Definitions](https://github.com/AdobeDocs/uxp-premiere-pro/blob/main/src/pages/ppro_reference/types.d.ts)\n- [How to use 'Action' in PremierePro UXP (Forum)](https://forums.creativeclouddeveloper.com/t/how-to-use-action-in-premierepro-uxp/8867)\n- [ProjectItem API Documentation](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/ppro_reference/classes/projectitem/)\n- [UXP: Razor tool and marking clipped sections (Forum)](https://community.adobe.com/t5/premiere-pro-discussions/uxp-razor-tool-and-marking-clipped-sections/td-p/15547922)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":0,"cache_creation_input_tokens":768,"cache_read_input_tokens":28356,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":768,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWGYrEkASHfX23Z7ZykpK","type":"assistant","uuid":"403125c4-4e22-4958-ba50-b2aad5caa61e","timestamp":"2025-12-19T18:52:14.855Z"}
