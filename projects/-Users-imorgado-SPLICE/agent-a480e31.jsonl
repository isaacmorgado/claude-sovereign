When you install Mac apps, plug-ins, and installer packages from outside the App Store, macOS checks the Developer ID signature to verify that the software is from an identified developer and that it has not been altered.(no content)By default, macOS Catalina and later also requires software to be notarized, so you can be confident that the software you run on your Mac doesn't contain known malware.\n\n### macOS Sequoia (15.x) Changes\nThe most notable change in macOS Sequoia is the removal of the long-standing Control-click (right-click) override option for untrusted software. Previously, users could bypass Gatekeeper warnings by right-clicking an app and selecting \"Open.\"(no content)Starting with macOS 15 (Sequoia) the user additionally has to go to \"System Settings / Privacy & Security\" then scroll down to the bottom and select \"Open Anyway\".\n\n### Distributing Without Developer ID Signing\nEverything you make is adhoc signed automatically by the infrastructure. You don't need a developer account to run things on your own machine, you do if you want to distribute to other machines without a Gatekeeper popup.(no content)gcc main.c results in an ad hoc signed binary in Mac land. It runs on your machine with no issues, but if you send it someone else then they will be blocked running it until they go to Security to enable it.\n\n### Workarounds for Unsigned Software\nGatekeeper will only verify applications that have the quarantine flag. As this flag is added by other applications and not by the system, any neglect or failure to do so does not trigger Gatekeeper. The flag is also not added if the application came from a different source, like network shares and USB flash drives.(no content)If you don't care about notarisation / Gatekeeper, but just want to test other parts of your app, you should distribute the app in a way that doesn't set quarantine (I typically use scp for this) or, if that's not appropriate, either manually remove the quarantine or just bypass Gatekeeper.\n\n### Removing Quarantine Attribute\nUsers can remove the quarantine extended attribute from downloaded files using Terminal:\n```bash\nxattr -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/plugin\n```\n\n### Official Recommendation\nMake sure to sign any apps, plug-ins, or installer packages that you distribute to let Gatekeeper know they're safe to install.\n\nFor CEP plugins specifically, users distributing without Apple Developer signing will need to instruct their users to either:\n1.

In addition, CEP checks for a valid certificate each time a host application tries to run an extension.\n\n## macOS Gatekeeper Issues\n\nUsually when you see install errors on macOS, Gatekeeper is often to blame.(no content)One workaround is by right-clicking the installer, going to \"Show Package Contents\" and then drilling down into `Contents/MacOS/NameOfInstaller` and double-clicking whatever is inside that `Contents` folder. However, this isn't ideal for end users.\n\n## Installation Methods\n\nAnastasiy's extension manager is a third-party developed tool that can help you install extensions packaged in .zxp format. You can download and install it from Anastasiy's extension manager download page.(no content)ZXP installer for Mac during installation of extension asks user to enter password so the installation can be continued. By the script you may only copy files to CEP if previously user gave permission to that folder manually.\n\n## Known Cross-Platform Signing Issues (2024)\n\nZXP files signed on macOS are failing when installed and run on Windows machines, and vice versa. For the time being, the workaround is to sign ZXPs on the platform they are expected to be run on. Sign ZXPs for use with macOS on a macOS machine, and ZXPs intended for Windows on Windows devices.(no content)When CEP attempts to load a plugin in the host application, it relies on a library called ZXPSignLib to verify the plugin package's signature. If the plugin package is installed via UPIA – or an installer that uses UPIA, such as \"ZXPInstaller\", the signature verification fails, preventing the plugin from loading.\n\n## Manual Installation Alternative\n\nIt is possible to un-archive the ZXP and manually place the folder structure in /Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions.(no content)Do not use Adobe Extension Manager for CC2015 or later compatible Adobe apps. It is no longer supported and may create install issues.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"e130a575-3fe8-4edb-9766-c5ebd9637440","timestamp":"2026-01-10T03:08:54.515Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"ZXP file format Adobe CEP extension install macOS Gatekeeper warning","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01WjeBhGwEbVDhqQADKoTUF1","content":[{"title":"Solved: zxp installs on win10 but not on Mac - Adobe Support Community - 10548974","url":"https://community.adobe.com:443/t5/exchange-discussions/zxp-installs-on-win10-but-not-on-mac/td-p/10548974"},{"title":"how to install the CEP extension properly · Issue #47 · Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/issues/47"},{"title":"Cross-platform ZXP Signing Compatibility Known Iss... - Adobe Product Community - 14961412","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/exchange-bugs/cross-platform-zxp-signing-compatibility-known-issue-and-workaround-2024/idi-p/14961412"},{"title":"Getting-Started-guides/Package Distribute Install/readme.md at master · Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/blob/master/Package%20Distribute%20Install/readme.md"},{"title":"Getting-Started-guides/Package Distribute Install at master · Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/tree/master/Package%20Distribute%20Install"},{"title":"Solved: Installing ZXP Extensions on CC Enterprise - Adobe Product Community - 10425284","url":"https://community.adobe.com/t5/photoshop-ecosystem-discussions/installing-zxp-extensions-on-cc-enterprise/td-p/10425284"},{"title":"ZXP/UXP Installer FAQ - aescripts.com","url":"https://aescripts.com/faq/article/view/faq/zxp-installer-faq/"},{"title":"Distribute as a zxp file | autoEdit 2 Documentation","url":"https://autoedit.gitbook.io/documentation/distributing-adobe-cep-extensions/distribute-as-a-zxp-file"},{"title":"ExManCmd library issues on Mac · Issue #66 · Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources","url":"https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/issues/66"},{"title":"Packaging signing Adobe CEP Panel in details | autoEdit 2 Documentation","url":"https://autoedit.gitbook.io/documentation/adobe-panel/packaging-adobe-cep-extensions/packaging-signing-adobe-cep-panel-in-details"}]},"Based on the search results, here's information about ZXP file format, Adobe CEP extension installation on macOS, and Gatekeeper warnings:\n\n## ZXP File Format and Adobe CEP Extensions\n\nAfter you have successfully built your extension, you should package the extension in the ZXP format and sign the extension with a valid certificate in order to distribute your extension properly.(no content)The signature verifies that the package has not been altered since it was packaged.

For this to work, the script name must match the application name and they must not create an Info.plist file. When the dmg is mounted and the application is double-clicked, the combination of a script-based application with no Info.plist file executes without any quarantine, signature or notarization verification.(no content)This vulnerability affects devices with macOS version 10.15 to 11.2 but has been patched as of 11.3.\n\n### Curl/Wget Bypass Method\n\nFiles pulled down by curl do not have the quarantine attribute appended.(no content)You can also download the application using a tool that doesn't set the quarantine attribute. curl or wget should work for this. This is how Steam and update frameworks like Sparkle are able to download and run applications without requiring them to be signed.\n\n### CVE-2021-30853 - Shebang Bypass\n\nCreating an app that uses a script starting with a shebang (!#) character but leaving the rest of the line empty tells the Unix shell to run the script without specifying a shell command interpreter. This leads to a Gatekeeper bypass because the syspolicyd daemon no longer gets triggered for inspection when launching a script without specifying an interpreter.\n\n### Legitimate Bypass Methods\n\nThere are tools available to remove app from GateKeeper quarantine and self-sign apps.(no content)The command `sudo spctl --master-disable` can be used to globally disable Gatekeeper.\n\n### Malware Exploitation\n\nThe bug is currently being used in the wild by the Shlayer malware which is an adware that injects ads into web pages.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"9f6fb22d-7e68-4108-8c73-1155edabf9c6","timestamp":"2026-01-10T03:09:18.266Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"shell script .sh installer macOS Gatekeeper quarantine bypass","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_01FcmHtPenoRpsDyKST6Dxh9","content":[{"title":"macOS Gatekeeper Bypass (2021 Edition) | by Cedric Owens | Medium","url":"https://cedowens.medium.com/macos-gatekeeper-bypass-2021-edition-5256a2955508"},{"title":"How To Run a Script To Bypass Security Bug for macOS (versions 10.15 to 11.2) | Addigy","url":"https://addigy.com/blog/how-to-run-a-script-to-bypass-security-bug-for-macos-versions-10-15-to-11-2/"},{"title":"Shlayer malware abusing Gatekeeper bypass on macOS","url":"https://www.jamf.com/blog/shlayer-malware-abusing-gatekeeper-bypass-on-macos/"},{"title":"Bypassing the macOS Gatekeeper","url":"https://breakpoint.sh/posts/bypassing-the-macos-gatekeeper"},{"title":"Bypass MacOS Gatekeeper for specific apps & executables on command line · GitHub","url":"https://gist.github.com/kennwhite/814ff7ed1fd62b921144035c877c3e4c"},{"title":"macOS Sequoia: Bypassing Gatekeeper to install unsigned apps - TechBloat","url":"https://www.techbloat.com/macos-sequoia-bypassing-gatekeeper-to-install-unsigned-apps.html"},{"title":"Disable Gatekeeper on macOS Catalina (10.15)","url":"https://disable-gatekeeper.github.io/"},{"title":"GitHub - wynioux/macOS-GateKeeper-Helper: Simple macOS GateKeeper script.","url":"https://github.com/wynioux/macOS-GateKeeper-Helper"},{"title":"How to Bypass Gatekeeper & Exploit macOS 10.14.5 & Earlier :: Null Byte","url":"https://null-byte.wonderhowto.com/how-to/bypass-gatekeeper-exploit-macos-10-14-5-earlier-0198089/"},{"title":"Apple fixes macOS security flaw behind Gatekeeper bypass","url":"https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/apple/apple-fixes-macos-security-flaw-behind-gatekeeper-bypass/"}]},"Based on the search results, here's what I found about shell script installers, macOS Gatekeeper, and quarantine bypass:\n\n## Key Findings\n\n### CVE-2021-30657 - Gatekeeper Bypass via Script-Based Applications\n\nThis bug essentially allows a downloaded application bundle to bypass all of Apple's security mechanisms (File Quarantine, Gatekeeper, Application Notarization) and execute an arbitrary script.(no content)The vulnerability works by having an attacker manually craft an application bundle by using a script as the main executable (example: myapplication.app/Contents/MacOS/myapplication where \"myapplication\" is a bash script).

The signature allows the customer to verify that the downloaded disk image is exactly as you created it, that it has not been maliciously modified, and that it was created by a valid Mac developer registered with Apple's Developer ID program.(no content)Gatekeeper does not require a signed DMG. However, it isn't necessary to sign disk images. The notary service will accept an unsigned disk image and the resulting ticket will then cover just the disk image's content.\n\n### App Translocation for Unsigned DMGs\n\nIf the disk image is not signed, an application stored on it will be subject to Gatekeeper Path Randomization (a.k.a. App Translocation). That is, macOS will copy it to a read-only, random location prior to launch. The app will not be able to update itself or access its external resources, and it can lose privacy permissions that you had granted.(no content)macOS stops using path randomization on an app when the user moves it (via Finder—other ways of moving the file don't work). However, neither the failure mode nor the remedy is made clear to the user, so it's best to avoid potential problems entirely by using a signed disk image.\n\n### Notarization Requirements\n\nSeparate from code signing, Apple recommends that applications and disk images be notarized. Notarization is required for new developers starting with macOS 10.14.5 and for all developers starting with macOS 10.15. (\"Required\" means that, without notarization, macOS will prevent launching the app and will show a scary alert window saying that it couldn't check the app for malware.)\n\n### Future Restrictions\n\nAt WWDC 2019, Apple announced that \"in a future version of macOS, unsigned code will not run by default anymore\". However, unsigned code causes problems on current versions of macOS. For example, the system uses the app's code signature to determine its access to keychain items.\n\n### Security Considerations for Unsigned DMGs\n\nDMG files can be safe if signed and verified. Unsigned or third-party DMGs should be treated with caution.(no content)macOS's Gatekeeper security feature checks these signatures.

If not set, After Effects will list the extension but show an error on opening, or it may not list it at all if unsigned.(no content)To set the Player Debug Mode flag on Windows, add a registry key `PlayerDebugMode=1` under `HKEY_CURRENT_USER/Software/Adobe/CSXS.<version>` (e.g., CSXS.10 for CEP 10). On macOS, run: `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.<version> PlayerDebugMode 1`. Use the CEP version matching your Adobe app release (AE 2022+ uses CSXS.11).(no content)If it is an unsigned version of extension installed, then you will have to switch on the debug mode for the new version of CSXS.\n\n### Distribution Without ZXP (For Non-Exchange Distribution)\nAccording to Adobe documentation: \"If you aren't distributing on Adobe Exchange or the Admin Console, ZXP may not be required.\" You can package and install a CEP extension without packaging it as a ZXP file.\n\n### Signing and Packaging for Official Distribution\nAdobe provides a command-line tool, ZXPSignCmd, that can be used to package and sign extensions. They provide a guide as a reference on packaging and signing.(no content)Adobe recommends using the updated ZXP Sign Command tool available at: https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/ZXPSignCMD/4.1.3\n\n### Current Signing Challenges (2024-2025)\nThere's a widespread issue where all major certificate authorities have recently restricted the ability to export .p12 and .pfx files due to private key security protocols. This has effectively blocked traditional signing methods required for Adobe Exchange. Developers are now exploring cloud-based code signing options as a potential workaround.(no content)There are concerns that these new signing methods won't be usable with ZXPSignCmd unless the ZXPSignCmd developers contact DigiCert and collaborate on adding support for DigiCert's SMCTL and/or PKCS11/KSP, as well as other CAs.\n\n### CEP Platform Updates\nCEP 12 shipped with Photoshop 25.12, Premiere Pro 25.0, and After Effects 25.0. CEP 12 will be the last major update to CEP, although critical security issues will continue to be addressed. There are no new features planned further.(no content)CEP 12 now supports a newer version of Chromium 99, updated v8 to 9.9.115, and updated the deprecated OpenGL APIs to Metal on Mac. CEP 12 works with NodeJS 17.7.1, so some extensions built on older versions of NodeJS may need to be updated in order to continue to load.\n\n### Best Practices for Marketplace Distribution\nYou should always use the same Adobe ID to submit CEP and UXP plugins.

On macOS, run: `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.<version> PlayerDebugMode 1`. Use the CEP version matching your Adobe app release (AE 2022+ uses CSXS.11).(no content)If it is an unsigned version of extension installed, then you will have to switch on the debug mode for the new version of CSXS.\n\n### Distribution Without ZXP (For Non-Exchange Distribution)\nAccording to Adobe documentation: \"If you aren't distributing on Adobe Exchange or the Admin Console, ZXP may not be required.\" You can package and install a CEP extension without packaging it as a ZXP file.\n\n### Signing and Packaging for Official Distribution\nAdobe provides a command-line tool, ZXPSignCmd, that can be used to package and sign extensions. They provide a guide as a reference on packaging and signing.(no content)Adobe recommends using the updated ZXP Sign Command tool available at: https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/ZXPSignCMD/4.1.3\n\n### Current Signing Challenges (2024-2025)\nThere's a widespread issue where all major certificate authorities have recently restricted the ability to export .p12 and .pfx files due to private key security protocols. This has effectively blocked traditional signing methods required for Adobe Exchange. Developers are now exploring cloud-based code signing options as a potential workaround.(no content)There are concerns that these new signing methods won't be usable with ZXPSignCmd unless the ZXPSignCmd developers contact DigiCert and collaborate on adding support for DigiCert's SMCTL and/or PKCS11/KSP, as well as other CAs.\n\n### CEP Platform Updates\nCEP 12 shipped with Photoshop 25.12, Premiere Pro 25.0, and After Effects 25.0. CEP 12 will be the last major update to CEP, although critical security issues will continue to be addressed. There are no new features planned further.(no content)CEP 12 now supports a newer version of Chromium 99, updated v8 to 9.9.115, and updated the deprecated OpenGL APIs to Metal on Mac. CEP 12 works with NodeJS 17.7.1, so some extensions built on older versions of NodeJS may need to be updated in order to continue to load.\n\n### Best Practices for Marketplace Distribution\nYou should always use the same Adobe ID to submit CEP and UXP plugins. This makes it easier to track plugin performance, manage your listings, and respond to user comments.(no content)Users can trust that plugins listed on the Marketplace are both secure and usable, because they have gone through a formal review process."],"durationSeconds":26.519470499999997}}

Under the hood, this is a zip file.\n\n## Creating CCX Packages\n\nThe UXP Developer Tool (UDT) simplifies the process of creating, loading, managing, and debugging plugins for Adobe's UXP-powered applications. It lets you package plugins into a .ccx installable file, ready for distribution.(no content)Open the UXP Developer Tool and make sure the plugin you intend to package is listed in the workspace—it doesn't need to be loaded in the host application. Click on the ••• icon to open the flyout menu and select Package. This will open a dialog where you can select the folder where the package will be stored. If everything goes to plan, the package will be created and named after the plugin's ID, e.g., Test-xjluvc_premierepro.ccx.\n\n## Installation Methods\n\n### Double-Click Installation\nIf you have developed or acquired a UXP plugin from a third-party, you can install it by double-clicking on the .ccx file. If not already open, the Creative Cloud Desktop application will launch. You will be prompted with an additional warning dialog since the plugin doesn't come from the Creative Cloud Marketplace; click on the Install button to continue.\n\n### Command Line Installation (UPIA)\nWe have added the ability to install UXP plugins, that is to say, .CCX and .XDX files for Photoshop and Adobe XD, using the Universal Plugin Installer Agent (UPIA) via the command line, for users with Creative Cloud Desktop App (CCD) 5.7 or higher.(no content)Under the hood, the Creative Cloud Desktop application uses a command-line utility called the Unified Plugin Installer Agent (UPIA) to manage UXP plugins. Please refer to the UPIA tool documentation for a detailed usage guide for both macOS and Windows. The UPIA tool can install, uninstall, and list plugins.\n\n## Plugin File Locations\n\nUXP plugins are installed by default in the user level folder: Windows: C:\\Users\\<USERNAME>\\AppData\\Roaming\\Adobe\\UXP\\Plugins · macOS: ~/Users/<username>/Library/Application Support/Adobe/UXP/Plugins. You cannot write UXP plugins directly into the directories above like you could with CEP panels. UXP plugins must be installed via either double-click or UPIA in order to correctly update a database file.\n\n## Enterprise Distribution\n\nThere are two primary ways to deploy UXP plugins at scale: Via the Admin Console with Creative Cloud Marketplace integration Add plugins directly to your deployment packages or make them available for self-service installation. By bundling plugin installers (.ccx files) into managed packages Manually place plugin files in package folders and deploy them alongside Creative Cloud apps.\n\n## Important Considerations\n\nUXP plugin .ccx installers can target only one host application at a time; in fact, the host property in the manifest.json file must be a single object of type HostDefinition.(no content)When you initiate the CCX installer, it will \"look\" for a certain file directory to install in. Adobe will only allow CCX installers to search the directory that it is currently stored on. So, in order to successfully install the new UXP panels, be sure to run the installation file (.CCX) from the same drive that Adobe Photoshop and Creative Cloud App are installed on.\n\n\nREMINDER: You MUST include the sources above in your response to the user using markdown hyperlinks."}]},"uuid":"2f26e904-e61a-4e5d-b27c-565fbdf33a29","timestamp":"2026-01-10T03:09:28.191Z","toolUseResult":{"query":"CCX UXP plugin format Adobe Creative Cloud distribution install 2024 2025","results":[{"tool_use_id":"srvtoolu_013cMcDQjfMd2ZnTfQCngRVj","content":[{"title":"Package a UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/package/"},{"title":"Install a UXP plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/install/"},{"title":"Packaging Your Plugin","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/distribution/packaging-your-plugin/"},{"title":"Enterprise Distribution","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/enterprise-distribution/"},{"title":"UXP Panels installation troubleshooting – Retouching Academy Lab","url":"https://retouchingacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6470828122381-UXP-Panels-installation-troubleshooting"},{"title":"How to Install UXP Plugins Using Command Line Tools","url":"https://blog.developer.adobe.com/en/publish/2022/03/how-to-install-uxp-plugins-using-command-line-tools"},{"title":"Share & Distribute","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/indesign/uxp/introduction/next-steps/distribution/distribution-options/"},{"title":"Essential Development Tools for UXP","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/introduction/essentials/dev-tools/"},{"title":"Distribution Options","url":"https://developer.adobe.com/photoshop/uxp/2022/guides/distribution/distribution-options/"},{"title":"How to Install the Plugin for Photoshop (Uxp version) :","url":"https://pixelexpand.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/153000182709-how-to-install-the-plugin-for-photoshop-uxp-version-"}]},"Based on my search results, here's what I found about the CCX UXP plugin format for Adobe Creative Cloud distribution and installation:\n\n## CCX File Format Overview\n\nThe .ccx format is installed directly by the Creative Cloud Desktop application, which has proved to be more reliable than the ExManCmd utility—easier for the final users to install, and less error prone.(no content)UXP plugins for Photoshop are distributed in the form of a .ccx file.

ZXP Format Distribution\n\n**Does it trigger Gatekeeper?** No, ZXP files themselves don't trigger Gatekeeper because they are installed via Adobe tools, not executed directly by macOS.\n\n**Installation Steps:**\n1. User downloads the .zxp file\n2. User installs using Anastasiy's Extension Manager, aescripts ZXP Installer, or ExManCmd\n3. Extension appears in Premiere Pro under Window > Extensions\n\n**Pros:**\n- Industry standard for CEP distribution\n- No Gatekeeper warnings during installation\n- Multiple free installer tools available\n- Cross-platform (same file works on Windows/Mac)\n\n**Cons:**\n- Requires users to install a third-party tool first\n- [Known signing issues in 2024](https://community.adobe.com/t5/exchange-bugs/cross-platform-zxp-signing-compatibility-known-issue-and-workaround-2024/idi-p/14961412) - ZXP signed on macOS may fail on Windows and vice versa\n- Still requires ZXP signing (self-signed certificate works, not Apple Developer)\n\n**Implementation Effort:** Medium - Use Adobe's [ZXPSignCmd tool](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/CEP-Resources/tree/master/ZXPSignCMD) to create and sign ZXP\n\n---\n\n### 2. Anastasiy's Extension Manager\n\n**Does it trigger Gatekeeper?** The manager itself may trigger Gatekeeper on first launch, but users can right-click > Open to bypass.\n\n**Installation Steps:**\n1. User downloads [Anastasiy's Extension Manager](https://install.anastasiy.com/) (v4.2, supports CC 2024)\n2. On macOS Catalina+, right-click the app and choose Open\n3. Drag and drop .zxp file into the manager\n4. Extension installs automatically for all supported Adobe apps\n\n**Pros:**\n- Free, well-maintained tool\n- Widely recommended by Adobe community\n- Simple drag-and-drop interface\n- Supports CC 2024\n\n**Cons:**\n- Users must install the manager first\n- Manager itself needs Gatekeeper bypass on first run\n\n**Implementation Effort:** Low - Just provide the .zxp file\n\n---\n\n### 3. aescripts ZXP/UXP Installer\n\n**Does it trigger Gatekeeper?** Similar to Anastasiy's - the installer app may need first-run bypass.\n\n**Installation Steps:**\n1. Download [aescripts ZXP/UXP Installer](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer/)\n2. Drag and drop .zxp file onto installer window\n3. Extension appears in Window > Extensions menu\n\n**Pros:**\n- Free, designed to work when other installers fail\n- Also supports newer UXP format\n- Well-known in the Adobe community\n\n**Cons:**\n- Requires third-party tool installation\n- The installer app needs Gatekeeper bypass\n\n**Implementation Effort:** Low - Just provide the .zxp file\n\n---\n\n### 4. Adobe ExManCmd / UPIA Command Line\n\n**Does it trigger Gatekeeper?** Yes, the ExManCmd tool itself needs quarantine removal.\n\n**Installation Steps:**\n1. Download [ExManCmd](https://partners.adobe.com/exchangeprogram/creativecloud/support/exman-com-line-tool.html) or use UPIA (included with CC Desktop 5.5+)\n2. Remove quarantine: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/Contents/MacOS/ExManBridgeTalkCmd`\n3. Run: `./ExManCmd --install extension.zxp`\n\n**Note:** ExManCmd is being replaced by [UPIA (Unified Plugin Installer Agent)](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/new-command-line-tool-for-plugin-installation-replaces-exmancmd-c38b4bf9d8e4), which is bundled with Creative Cloud Desktop.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Official Adobe tool\n- Good for enterprise/IT deployment\n- UPIA is pre-installed with Creative Cloud\n\n**Cons:**\n- Command-line knowledge required\n- ExManCmd being deprecated\n- Still requires quarantine removal\n\n**Implementation Effort:** Medium - Provide installation script\n\n---\n\n### 5. CCX/UXP Format (Modern Alternative)\n\n**Does it trigger Gatekeeper?** No - installed via Creative Cloud Desktop app.\n\n**Important:** [UXP is the future of Adobe extensibility](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/package/). CEP is legacy and CEP 12 is the final major version.\n\n**Installation Steps:**\n1. Double-click the .ccx file\n2. Creative Cloud Desktop launches\n3. User clicks \"Install\" in the warning dialog\n4. Plugin installs automatically\n\n**Pros:**\n- No Gatekeeper issues - handled entirely by Creative Cloud\n- Officially supported by Adobe\n- More reliable installation than ZXP\n- Future-proof (UXP is the new standard)\n\n**Cons:**\n- Only works for UXP plugins, not CEP\n- Must be built for UXP from scratch\n- [Single host application per .ccx file](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/install/)\n\n**Implementation Effort:** High if you need to port from CEP to UXP\n\n---\n\n### 6. DMG with Manual Installation\n\n**Does it trigger Gatekeeper?** Yes, both the DMG and the app inside it will trigger warnings if unsigned.\n\n**User Workaround:** \n- macOS Sonoma and earlier: Right-click > Open\n- macOS Sequoia 15.1+: [Must go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > \"Open Anyway\"](https://hackaday.com/2024/11/01/apple-forces-the-signing-of-applications-in-macos-sequoia-15-1/)\n\n**Important:** Even if you use a DMG, the app inside is subject to [App Translocation](https://c-command.com/dropdmg/help/signing) - macOS copies it to a random read-only location before launching, breaking many apps.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Familiar Mac installation experience\n- Can include drag-to-Applications instructions\n\n**Cons:**\n- Still triggers Gatekeeper warnings\n- App Translocation can break functionality\n- Sequoia 15.1+ makes bypass even harder\n\n**Implementation Effort:** Low\n\n---\n\n### 7. Shell Script Installer\n\n**Does it trigger Gatekeeper?** Yes, but with caveats.\n\n**How it works:**\n- Downloaded .sh scripts get quarantine attribute\n- Users must run `chmod +x install.sh && ./install.sh`\n- The script copies files to `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/`\n\n**Pros:**\n- No app bundle to sign\n- Can automate quarantine removal for plugin files\n- Full control over installation process\n\n**Cons:**\n- Requires Terminal usage (intimidating for some users)\n- Script itself may be blocked\n- [Past Gatekeeper bypass vulnerabilities](https://cedowens.medium.com/macos-gatekeeper-bypass-2021-edition-5256a2955508) using scripts have been patched\n\n**Implementation Effort:** Medium\n\n---\n\n### 8. ZIP Archive with Manual Instructions\n\n**Does it trigger Gatekeeper?** The ZIP itself doesn't trigger warnings, but files inside may have quarantine.\n\n**Installation Steps:**\n1. Download ZIP file\n2. Extract contents\n3. Remove quarantine: `xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine /path/to/extracted/folder`\n4. Copy to `/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/`\n5. Enable debug mode: `defaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11 PlayerDebugMode 1`\n\n**Important:** [Remove quarantine BEFORE extracting](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/clearing-the-quarantine-extended-attribute-from-downloaded-applications/) - otherwise extracted files inherit it.\n\n**Pros:**\n- Simplest distribution method\n- No special tools required\n- Works on any macOS version\n\n**Cons:**\n- Requires Terminal commands\n- Requires enabling [debug mode](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/issues/47) unless ZXP-signed\n- Multi-step manual process\n\n**Implementation Effort:** Very Low\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Approach\n\nBased on my research, here's the best strategy:\n\n### Option A: ZXP via Third-Party Installers (Best Balance)\n\n1. **Create a self-signed ZXP** using ZXPSignCmd (no Apple Developer ID needed)\n2. **Distribute the .zxp file** with instructions to use:\n   - [Anastasiy's Extension Manager](https://install.anastasiy.com/) (recommended)\n   - [aescripts ZXP/UXP Installer](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer/)\n   - [ZXPInstaller.com](https://zxpinstaller.com/)\n\n**Why this works:**\n- ZXP signing uses Adobe's certificate system, not Apple's\n- Third-party installers are free and well-known\n- No Gatekeeper issues with the plugin itself\n- Industry standard approach\n\n### Option B: ZIP with Automated Install Script (For Technical Users)\n\nProvide a ZIP containing:\n- Extension folder\n- `install.sh` script that:\n  1. Removes quarantine from files\n  2. Copies to CEP extensions folder\n  3. Enables debug mode\n  4. Provides clear terminal output\n\n```bash\n#!/bin/bash\nEXTENSION_NAME=\"YourExtension\"\nTARGET=\"/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/$EXTENSION_NAME\"\n\n# Remove quarantine\nxattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine \"$(dirname \"$0\")\"\n\n# Copy extension\nsudo mkdir -p \"$TARGET\"\nsudo cp -R \"$(dirname \"$0\")/$EXTENSION_NAME\" \"$TARGET/\"\n\n# Enable unsigned extensions (CEP 11 for Premiere Pro 2022+)\ndefaults write com.adobe.CSXS.11 PlayerDebugMode 1\n\necho \"Installation complete. Restart Premiere Pro.\"\n```\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaways\n\n| Method | Gatekeeper Issues | User Difficulty | Recommended |\n|--------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------|\n| ZXP + Anastasiy | Minimal (tool only) | Easy | Yes |\n| ZXP + aescripts Installer | Minimal (tool only) | Easy | Yes |\n| CCX/UXP | None | Very Easy | Yes (if UXP) |\n| ZIP + Manual | Quarantine removal needed | Medium | For tech users |\n| DMG | Full Gatekeeper block | Hard | No |\n| PKG (current) | Full Gatekeeper block | Hard | No |\n\n**Bottom line:** Switch from .pkg to .zxp format and recommend users install via [Anastasiy's Extension Manager](https://install.anastasiy.com/) or the [aescripts ZXP/UXP Installer](https://aescripts.com/learn/zxp-installer/). This is what most CEP developers do and avoids Apple Developer signing entirely.\n\n---\n\nSources:\n- [Adobe CEP Getting Started - Package Distribute Install](https://github.com/Adobe-CEP/Getting-Started-guides/blob/master/Package%20Distribute%20Install/readme.md)\n- [Anastasiy's Extension Manager](https://install.anastasiy.com/)\n- [aescripts ZXP/UXP Installer FAQ](https://aescripts.com/faq/article/view/faq/zxp-installer-faq/)\n- [Adobe UXP Plugin Distribution](https://developer.adobe.com/premiere-pro/uxp/plugins/distribution/install/)\n- [UPIA Replaces ExManCmd](https://blog.developer.adobe.com/new-command-line-tool-for-plugin-installation-replaces-exmancmd-c38b4bf9d8e4)\n- [Clearing macOS Quarantine Attribute](https://derflounder.wordpress.com/2012/11/20/clearing-the-quarantine-extended-attribute-from-downloaded-applications/)\n- [Apple Support - Safely Open Apps](https://support.apple.com/en-us/102445)\n- [macOS Sequoia Signing Changes](https://hackaday.com/2024/11/01/apple-forces-the-signing-of-applications-in-macos-sequoia-15-1/)"}],"stop_reason":null,"stop_sequence":null,"usage":{"input_tokens":938,"cache_creation_input_tokens":4926,"cache_read_input_tokens":30520,"cache_creation":{"ephemeral_5m_input_tokens":4926,"ephemeral_1h_input_tokens":0},"output_tokens":1,"service_tier":"standard"}},"requestId":"req_011CWxxp2ikBza6S6nLiMCqh","type":"assistant","uuid":"38f27ee9-974c-48a0-9f82-d3c8d9549c84","timestamp":"2026-01-10T03:10:57.610Z"}
