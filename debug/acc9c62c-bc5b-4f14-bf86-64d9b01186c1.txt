  What's Done:
  - ✅ ReflexionAgent LLM integration complete (think() method + filename context)
  - ✅ All autonomous stress tests passing (6/6, 100%)

  Current State: Committed improvements to typescript-integration branch (bd84614). Goal validation now working - detects when actions affect wrong files.

  Next Step: Monitor ReflexionAgent performance in production /auto tasks, or test multi-iteration scenarios (30-50 iterations) with real LLM reasoning.

  Key Files:
  - src/core/agents/reflexion/index.ts (LLM-powered reasoning)
  - tests/agents/reflexion-autonomous-stress.test.ts (validation suite)

  Key Context:
  - think() now routes through LLM router with context-aware prompts
  - observe() includes filenames enabling file-specific goal validation
  - Tests validate stagnation detection (5+ iterations), repetition detection (3+ identical thoughts)

  Approach: Check CLAUDE.md for implementation details. ReflexionAgent is production-ready for autonomous tasks.", isSkillFormat: false)

  What's Done:
  - ✅ ReflexionAgent LLM integration complete (think() method + filename context)
  - ✅ All autonomous stress tests passing (6/6, 100%)

  Current State: Committed improvements to typescript-integration branch (bd84614). Goal validation now working - detects when actions affect wrong files.

  Next Step: Monitor ReflexionAgent performance in production /auto tasks, or test multi-iteration scenarios (30-50 iterations) with real LLM reasoning.

  Key Files:
  - src/core/agents/reflexion/index.ts (LLM-powered reasoning)
  - tests/agents/reflexion-autonomous-stress.test.ts (validation suite)

  Key Context:
  - think() now routes through LLM router with context-aware prompts
  - observe() includes filenames enabling file-specific goal validation
  - Tests validate stagnation detection (5+ iterations), repetition detection (3+ identical thoughts)

  Approach: Check CLAUDE.md for implementation details. ReflexionAgent is production-ready for autonomous tasks.", isSkillFormat: false)

  What's Done:
  - ✅ ReflexionAgent LLM integration complete (think() method + filename context)
  - ✅ All autonomous stress tests passing (6/6, 100%)

  Current State: Committed improvements to typescript-integration branch (bd84614). Goal validation now working - detects when actions affect wrong files.

  Next Step: Monitor ReflexionAgent performance in production /auto tasks, or test multi-iteration scenarios (30-50 iterations) with real LLM reasoning.

  Key Files:
  - src/core/agents/reflexion/index.ts (LLM-powered reasoning)
  - tests/agents/reflexion-autonomous-stress.test.ts (validation suite)

  Key Context:
  - think() now routes through LLM router with context-aware prompts
  - observe() includes filenames enabling file-specific goal validation
  - Tests validate stagnation detection (5+ iterations), repetition detection (3+ identical thoughts)

  What's Done:
  - ✅ ReflexionAgent LLM integration complete (think() method + filename context)
  - ✅ All autonomous stress tests passing (6/6, 100%)

  Current State: Committed improvements to typescript-integration branch (bd84614). Goal validation now working - detects when actions affect wrong files.

  Next Step: Monitor ReflexionAgent performance in production /auto tasks, or test multi-iteration scenarios (30-50 iterations) with real LLM reasoning.

  Key Files:
  - src/core/agents/reflexion/index.ts (LLM-powered reasoning)
  - tests/agents/reflexion-autonomous-stress.test.ts (validation suite)

  Key Context:
  - think() now routes through LLM router with context-aware prompts
  - observe() includes filenames enabling file-specific goal validation
  - Tests validate stagnation detection (5+ iterations), repetition detection (3+ identical thoughts)
