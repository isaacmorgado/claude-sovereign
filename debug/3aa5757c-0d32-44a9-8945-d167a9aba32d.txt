  What's Done: ReflexionCommand CLI integration (Phase 1) - CLI command, integration tests, documentation complete

  Current State: Phase 1 complete (4/4 acceptance criteria met). ReflexionCommand can be invoked via bun run kk reflexion execute --goal "..." --output-json for orchestrator consumption.

  Next Step: Wait for API quota reset (24h from 2026-01-13 21:34), then run ./run-edge-case-tests.sh to validate 30-50 iteration performance with GLM-4.7

  Key Files:
  - src/cli/commands/ReflexionCommand.ts
  - tests/integration/reflexion-command.test.ts
  - REFLEXION-ORCHESTRATOR-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md

  Key Context: CLI outputs JSON parseable by jq. Always use --preferred-model glm-4.7 for tests to avoid Kimi-K2 rate limits. Phase 2 (orchestrator integration) ready to begin after edge case test validation.

  Approach: After quota reset, validate edge case tests. Then proceed to Phase 2: integrate ReflexionCommand into autonomous-orchestrator-v2.sh decision tree using the integration plan.", isSkillFormat: false)

  What's Done: ReflexionCommand CLI integration (Phase 1) - CLI command, integration tests, documentation complete

  Current State: Phase 1 complete (4/4 acceptance criteria met). ReflexionCommand can be invoked via bun run kk reflexion execute --goal "..." --output-json for orchestrator consumption.

  Next Step: Wait for API quota reset (24h from 2026-01-13 21:34), then run ./run-edge-case-tests.sh to validate 30-50 iteration performance with GLM-4.7

  Key Files:
  - src/cli/commands/ReflexionCommand.ts
  - tests/integration/reflexion-command.test.ts
  - REFLEXION-ORCHESTRATOR-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md

  Key Context: CLI outputs JSON parseable by jq. Always use --preferred-model glm-4.7 for tests to avoid Kimi-K2 rate limits. Phase 2 (orchestrator integration) ready to begin after edge case test validation.

  Approach: After quota reset, validate edge case tests. Then proceed to Phase 2: integrate ReflexionCommand into autonomous-orchestrator-v2.sh decision tree using the integration plan.", isSkillFormat: false)

  What's Done: ReflexionCommand CLI integration (Phase 1) - CLI command, integration tests, documentation complete

  Current State: Phase 1 complete (4/4 acceptance criteria met). ReflexionCommand can be invoked via bun run kk reflexion execute --goal "..." --output-json for orchestrator consumption.

  Next Step: Wait for API quota reset (24h from 2026-01-13 21:34), then run ./run-edge-case-tests.sh to validate 30-50 iteration performance with GLM-4.7

  Key Files:
  - src/cli/commands/ReflexionCommand.ts
  - tests/integration/reflexion-command.test.ts
  - REFLEXION-ORCHESTRATOR-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md

  Key Context: CLI outputs JSON parseable by jq. Always use --preferred-model glm-4.7 for tests to avoid Kimi-K2 rate limits. Phase 2 (orchestrator integration) ready to begin after edge case test validation.

  Approach: After quota reset, validate edge case tests. Then proceed to Phase 2: integrate ReflexionCommand into autonomous-orchestrator-v2.sh decision tree using the integration plan.", isSkillFormat: false)

  Next Step: Wait for API quota reset (24h from 2026-01-13 21:34), then run ./run-edge-case-tests.sh to validate 30-50 iteration performance with GLM-4.7

  Current State: Phase 1 complete (4/4 acceptance criteria met). ReflexionCommand can be invoked via bun run kk reflexion execute --goal "..." --output-json for orchestrator consumption.

  Next Step: Wait for API quota reset (24h from 2026-01-13 21:34), then run ./run-edge-case-tests.sh to validate 30-50 iteration performance with GLM-4.7

  Key Files:
  - src/cli/commands/ReflexionCommand.ts
  - tests/integration/reflexion-command.test.ts
  - REFLEXION-ORCHESTRATOR-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md

  Key Context: CLI outputs JSON parseable by jq. Always use --preferred-model glm-4.7 for tests to avoid Kimi-K2 rate limits. Phase 2 (orchestrator integration) ready to begin after edge case test validation.

  Approach: After quota reset, validate edge case tests. Then proceed to Phase 2: integrate ReflexionCommand into autonomous-orchestrator-v2.sh decision tree using the integration plan.", isSkillFormat: false)

  What's Done: ReflexionCommand CLI integration (Phase 1) - CLI command, integration tests, documentation complete

  Current State: Phase 1 complete (4/4 acceptance criteria met). ReflexionCommand can be invoked via bun run kk reflexion execute --goal "..." --output-json for orchestrator consumption.

  Next Step: Wait for API quota reset (24h from 2026-01-13 21:34), then run ./run-edge-case-tests.sh to validate 30-50 iteration performance with GLM-4.7

  Key Files:
  - src/cli/commands/ReflexionCommand.ts
  - tests/integration/reflexion-command.test.ts
  - REFLEXION-ORCHESTRATOR-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md

  Key Context: CLI outputs JSON parseable by jq. Always use --preferred-model glm-4.7 for tests to avoid Kimi-K2 rate limits. Phase 2 (orchestrator integration) ready to begin after edge case test validation.

  Approach: After quota reset, validate edge case tests. Then proceed to Phase 2: integrate ReflexionCommand into autonomous-orchestrator-v2.sh decision tree using the integration plan.", isSkillFormat: false)
