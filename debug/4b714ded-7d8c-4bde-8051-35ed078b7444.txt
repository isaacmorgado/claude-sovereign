  **Current State**: Core autonomy and safety structures complete. Branch `typescript-integration`, commit 65967b5 pushed to GitHub.

  - hooks/debug-orchestrator.sh (bash reference implementation)

  **What's Done**: Bounded Autonomy (5 modules) and Swarm Orchestration (6 modules) implemented in TypeScript. Both compile successfully (81.1 KB, 0 errors).

  **Current State**: Core autonomy and safety structures complete. Branch `typescript-integration`, commit 65967b5 pushed to GitHub.

  **Next Step**: Implement Debug Orchestrator with regression detection at src/core/debug/orchestrator/

  **Key Files**:
  - plans/ULTIMATE-TOOL-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md (lines 572-597: Debug Orchestrator spec)
  - hooks/debug-orchestrator.sh (bash reference implementation)
  - src/core/safety/bounded-autonomy/index.ts (pattern reference)

  **Key Context**: Debug Orchestrator needs 5 modules (Snapshotter, Memory, Searcher, Verifier, Recommender). Pattern similar to Bounded Autonomy and Swarm - core structure first, LLM integration later.

  **Approach**: Read plan spec and bash hook first. Follow same implementation pattern used for Bounded Autonomy and Swarm. Build compiles at 81.1 KB currently.", isSkillFormat: false)

  **What's Done**: Bounded Autonomy (5 modules) and Swarm Orchestration (6 modules) implemented in TypeScript. Both compile successfully (81.1 KB, 0 errors).

  **Current State**: Core autonomy and safety structures complete. Branch `typescript-integration`, commit 65967b5 pushed to GitHub.

  **Next Step**: Implement Debug Orchestrator with regression detection at src/core/debug/orchestrator/

  **Key Files**:
  - plans/ULTIMATE-TOOL-INTEGRATION-PLAN.md (lines 572-597: Debug Orchestrator spec)
  - hooks/debug-orchestrator.sh (bash reference implementation)
  - src/core/safety/bounded-autonomy/index.ts (pattern reference)

  **Key Context**: Debug Orchestrator needs 5 modules (Snapshotter, Memory, Searcher, Verifier, Recommender). Pattern similar to Bounded Autonomy and Swarm - core structure first, LLM integration later.

  **Approach**: Read plan spec and bash hook first. Follow same implementation pattern used for Bounded Autonomy and Swarm. Build compiles at 81.1 KB currently.", isSkillFormat: false)
