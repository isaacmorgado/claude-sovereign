Did you mean:\n\n- **Google Cloud (GCP)** - cloud platform services\n- **Google Workspace** - Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc.\n- **Gemini** - Google's AI model\n- Something else?\n\nOnce I understand what you're trying to connect, I can help you figure out the best approach with Claude Code.\n\nUser: gemini\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: ## Connecting Gemini to Claude Code\n\nClaude Code is designed to work with Claude models only, but you can integrate Gemini through **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**.\n\n### Recommended: Install a Gemini MCP Server\n\nThe easiest option is **RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp**:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/gemini-mcp\n```\n\nOr check out these community options:\n- **[RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp](https://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp)** - Direct Gemini queries and code analysis\n- **[PAL MCP Server](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server)** - Multi-model support (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)\n- **[jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool](https://github.com/jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool)** - Wraps Gemini CLI\n\n### How It Works\n\nOnce installed, Claude Code can delegate tasks to Gemini as a tool. This is useful for:\n- Leveraging Gemini's **1M+ token context window** for large codebases\n- Getting a \"second opinion\" on code analysis\n- Collaborative brainstorming between models\n\n### What You Can't Do\n\nYou cannot replace Claude as the primary model in Claude Code - it will always be the orchestrator. Gemini works as an auxiliary tool through MCP.\n\nWant help setting up a specific Gemini MCP server?\n\nUser: install the following:\nhttps://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: To install the Gemini MCP server, you'll need a **Gemini API key** from Google.\n\n**Do you have a Gemini API key?**\n\nIf yes, I can run the installation command for you:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -s user -- env GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY npx -y https://github.com/rlabs-inc/gemini-mcp.git\n```\n\nIf not, you can get one free at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey\n\nLet me know your API key (or if you'd prefer to run the command yourself with the key).\n\nUser: Spawn an explore agent to see if there is a gemini CLI that I can use? since I have a gemini ultra\n\nUser: \n\nUser: [Request interrupted by user]\n\nUser: there is this that I found as well https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Good find! That's the Google Cloud documentation for the same Gemini CLI. Here's the summary:\n\n## Gemini CLI Installation\n\n**It's the same tool** - just documented in two places. Install it with:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen launch with:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n## Authentication with Gemini Ultra\n\nSince you have **Gemini Ultra** (Google One AI Premium), you can authenticate with your Google account directly:\n\n1. Run `gemini`\n2. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n3. Authenticate in browser with your Google account that has the Ultra subscription\n\nThis gives you access to the premium models without needing a separate API key.\n\n---\n\nWant me to run the install command for you?\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nUser: I found this as well  https://geminicli.com/\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: That's the official site. Here's the key info:\n\n## Gemini CLI (Official)\n\n**Latest version uses Gemini 3** (Flash and Pro models)\n\n### Features\n- Query and edit large codebases\n- Generate apps from images/PDFs\n- Automate complex workflows\n- 1M+ token context window\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen run:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n### Authentication (for your Gemini Ultra)\nWhen you first run `gemini`, choose **\"Login with Google\"** and sign in with the Google account that has your Ultra subscription.\n\n---\n\nShould I install it now?\n\nUser: install it\n\nUser: \n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Gemini CLI installed successfully. **Version 0.22.4**\n\n### Next Steps\n\nRun `gemini` in your terminal to start it, then:\n1. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n2. Sign in with your Google account that has Gemini Ultra\n\nOnce authenticated, you can use it directly or integrate it with Claude Code via an MCP server if you want both tools working together.\n\nUser: I want to use gemini subscription so that you can spawn sub agents that use gemini instead of anthropic for the research instead but still follow those system prompts? How could we make that? Would we use Roo Code? Ollama? Deepseek-o1? what is the best way to achieve this. I don't want to use API keys but instead use my exsisting subscriptions\n\nRespond with the title for the conversation and nothing else."

Did you mean:\n\n- **Google Cloud (GCP)** - cloud platform services\n- **Google Workspace** - Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc.\n- **Gemini** - Google's AI model\n- Something else?\n\nOnce I understand what you're trying to connect, I can help you figure out the best approach with Claude Code.\n\nUser: gemini\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: ## Connecting Gemini to Claude Code\n\nClaude Code is designed to work with Claude models only, but you can integrate Gemini through **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**.\n\n### Recommended: Install a Gemini MCP Server\n\nThe easiest option is **RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp**:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/gemini-mcp\n```\n\nOr check out these community options:\n- **[RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp](https://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp)** - Direct Gemini queries and code analysis\n- **[PAL MCP Server](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server)** - Multi-model support (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)\n- **[jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool](https://github.com/jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool)** - Wraps Gemini CLI\n\n### How It Works\n\nOnce installed, Claude Code can delegate tasks to Gemini as a tool. This is useful for:\n- Leveraging Gemini's **1M+ token context window** for large codebases\n- Getting a \"second opinion\" on code analysis\n- Collaborative brainstorming between models\n\n### What You Can't Do\n\nYou cannot replace Claude as the primary model in Claude Code - it will always be the orchestrator. Gemini works as an auxiliary tool through MCP.\n\nWant help setting up a specific Gemini MCP server?\n\nUser: install the following:\nhttps://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: To install the Gemini MCP server, you'll need a **Gemini API key** from Google.\n\n**Do you have a Gemini API key?**\n\nIf yes, I can run the installation command for you:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -s user -- env GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY npx -y https://github.com/rlabs-inc/gemini-mcp.git\n```\n\nIf not, you can get one free at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey\n\nLet me know your API key (or if you'd prefer to run the command yourself with the key).\n\nUser: Spawn an explore agent to see if there is a gemini CLI that I can use? since I have a gemini ultra\n\nUser: \n\nUser: [Request interrupted by user]\n\nUser: there is this that I found as well https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Good find! That's the Google Cloud documentation for the same Gemini CLI. Here's the summary:\n\n## Gemini CLI Installation\n\n**It's the same tool** - just documented in two places. Install it with:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen launch with:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n## Authentication with Gemini Ultra\n\nSince you have **Gemini Ultra** (Google One AI Premium), you can authenticate with your Google account directly:\n\n1. Run `gemini`\n2. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n3. Authenticate in browser with your Google account that has the Ultra subscription\n\nThis gives you access to the premium models without needing a separate API key.\n\n---\n\nWant me to run the install command for you?\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nUser: I found this as well  https://geminicli.com/\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: That's the official site. Here's the key info:\n\n## Gemini CLI (Official)\n\n**Latest version uses Gemini 3** (Flash and Pro models)\n\n### Features\n- Query and edit large codebases\n- Generate apps from images/PDFs\n- Automate complex workflows\n- 1M+ token context window\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen run:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n### Authentication (for your Gemini Ultra)\nWhen you first run `gemini`, choose **\"Login with Google\"** and sign in with the Google account that has your Ultra subscription.\n\n---\n\nShould I install it now?\n\nUser: install it\n\nUser: \n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Gemini CLI installed successfully. **Version 0.22.4**\n\n### Next Steps\n\nRun `gemini` in your terminal to start it, then:\n1. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n2. Sign in with your Google account that has Gemini Ultra\n\nOnce authenticated, you can use it directly or integrate it with Claude Code via an MCP server if you want both tools working together.\n\nUser: I want to use gemini subscription so that you can spawn sub agents that use gemini instead of anthropic for the research instead but still follow those system prompts? How could we make that? Would we use Roo Code? Ollama? Deepseek-o1? what is the best way to achieve this. I don't want to use API keys but instead use my exsisting subscriptions\n\nRespond with the title for the conversation and nothing else."

Did you mean:\n\n- **Google Cloud (GCP)** - cloud platform services\n- **Google Workspace** - Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc.\n- **Gemini** - Google's AI model\n- Something else?\n\nOnce I understand what you're trying to connect, I can help you figure out the best approach with Claude Code.\n\nUser: gemini\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: ## Connecting Gemini to Claude Code\n\nClaude Code is designed to work with Claude models only, but you can integrate Gemini through **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**.\n\n### Recommended: Install a Gemini MCP Server\n\nThe easiest option is **RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp**:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/gemini-mcp\n```\n\nOr check out these community options:\n- **[RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp](https://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp)** - Direct Gemini queries and code analysis\n- **[PAL MCP Server](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server)** - Multi-model support (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)\n- **[jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool](https://github.com/jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool)** - Wraps Gemini CLI\n\n### How It Works\n\nOnce installed, Claude Code can delegate tasks to Gemini as a tool. This is useful for:\n- Leveraging Gemini's **1M+ token context window** for large codebases\n- Getting a \"second opinion\" on code analysis\n- Collaborative brainstorming between models\n\n### What You Can't Do\n\nYou cannot replace Claude as the primary model in Claude Code - it will always be the orchestrator. Gemini works as an auxiliary tool through MCP.\n\nWant help setting up a specific Gemini MCP server?\n\nUser: install the following:\nhttps://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: To install the Gemini MCP server, you'll need a **Gemini API key** from Google.\n\n**Do you have a Gemini API key?**\n\nIf yes, I can run the installation command for you:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -s user -- env GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY npx -y https://github.com/rlabs-inc/gemini-mcp.git\n```\n\nIf not, you can get one free at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey\n\nLet me know your API key (or if you'd prefer to run the command yourself with the key).\n\nUser: Spawn an explore agent to see if there is a gemini CLI that I can use? since I have a gemini ultra\n\nUser: \n\nUser: [Request interrupted by user]\n\nUser: there is this that I found as well https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Good find! That's the Google Cloud documentation for the same Gemini CLI. Here's the summary:\n\n## Gemini CLI Installation\n\n**It's the same tool** - just documented in two places. Install it with:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen launch with:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n## Authentication with Gemini Ultra\n\nSince you have **Gemini Ultra** (Google One AI Premium), you can authenticate with your Google account directly:\n\n1. Run `gemini`\n2. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n3. Authenticate in browser with your Google account that has the Ultra subscription\n\nThis gives you access to the premium models without needing a separate API key.\n\n---\n\nWant me to run the install command for you?\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nUser: I found this as well  https://geminicli.com/\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: That's the official site. Here's the key info:\n\n## Gemini CLI (Official)\n\n**Latest version uses Gemini 3** (Flash and Pro models)\n\n### Features\n- Query and edit large codebases\n- Generate apps from images/PDFs\n- Automate complex workflows\n- 1M+ token context window\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen run:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n### Authentication (for your Gemini Ultra)\nWhen you first run `gemini`, choose **\"Login with Google\"** and sign in with the Google account that has your Ultra subscription.\n\n---\n\nShould I install it now?\n\nUser: install it\n\nUser: \n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Gemini CLI installed successfully. **Version 0.22.4**\n\n### Next Steps\n\nRun `gemini` in your terminal to start it, then:\n1. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n2. Sign in with your Google account that has Gemini Ultra\n\nOnce authenticated, you can use it directly or integrate it with Claude Code via an MCP server if you want both tools working together.\n\nUser: I want to use gemini subscription so that you can spawn sub agents that use gemini instead of anthropic for the research instead but still follow those system prompts? How could we make that? Would we use Roo Code? Ollama? Deepseek-o1? what is the best way to achieve this. I don't want to use API keys but instead use my exsisting subscriptions\n\nRespond with the title for the conversation and nothing else."

Your role is to explore the codebase and design implementation plans.\n\n=== CRITICAL: READ-ONLY MODE - NO FILE MODIFICATIONS ===\nThis is a READ-ONLY planning task. You are STRICTLY PROHIBITED from:\n- Creating new files (no Write, touch, or file creation of any kind)\n- Modifying existing files (no Edit operations)\n- Deleting files (no rm or deletion)\n- Moving or copying files (no mv or cp)\n- Creating temporary files anywhere, including /tmp\n- Using redirect operators (>, >>, |) or heredocs to write to files\n- Running ANY commands that change system state\n\nYour role is EXCLUSIVELY to explore the codebase and design implementation plans. You do NOT have access to file editing tools - attempting to edit files will fail.\n\nYou will be provided with a set of requirements and optionally a perspective on how to approach the design process.\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand Requirements**: Focus on the requirements provided and apply your assigned perspective throughout the design process.\n\n2. **Explore Thoroughly**:\n   - Read any files provided to you in the initial prompt\n   - Find existing patterns and conventions using Glob, Grep, and Read\n   - Understand the current architecture\n   - Identify similar features as reference\n   - Trace through relevant code paths\n   - Use Bash ONLY for read-only operations (ls, git status, git log, git diff, find, cat, head, tail)\n   - NEVER use Bash for: mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv, git add, git commit, npm install, pip install, or any file creation/modification\n\n3. **Design Solution**:\n   - Create implementation approach based on your assigned perspective\n   - Consider trade-offs and architectural decisions\n   - Follow existing patterns where appropriate\n\n4. **Detail the Plan**:\n   - Provide step-by-step implementation strategy\n   - Identify dependencies and sequencing\n   - Anticipate potential challenges\n\n## Required Output\n\nEnd your response with:\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\nList 3-5 files most critical for implementing this plan:\n- path/to/file1.ts - [Brief reason: e.g., \"Core logic to modify\"]\n- path/to/file2.ts - [Brief reason: e.g., \"Interfaces to implement\"]\n- path/to/file3.ts - [Brief reason: e.g., \"Pattern to follow\"]\n\nREMEMBER: You can ONLY explore and plan. You CANNOT and MUST NOT write, edit, or modify any files. You do NOT have access to file editing tools.\n\n\nNotes:\n- Agent threads always have their cwd reset between bash calls, as a result please only use absolute file paths.\n- In your final response always share relevant file names and code snippets. Any file paths you return in your response MUST be absolute. Do NOT use relative paths.\n- For clear communication with the user the assistant MUST avoid using emojis.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/imorgado\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: darwin\nOS Version: Darwin 25.1.0\nToday's date: 2025-12-29\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Opus 4.5.

You do NOT have access to file editing tools - attempting to edit files will fail.\n\nYour strengths:\n- Rapidly finding files using glob patterns\n- Searching code and text with powerful regex patterns\n- Reading and analyzing file contents\n\nGuidelines:\n- Use Glob for broad file pattern matching\n- Use Grep for searching file contents with regex\n- Use Read when you know the specific file path you need to read\n- Use Bash ONLY for read-only operations (ls, git status, git log, git diff, find, cat, head, tail)\n- NEVER use Bash for: mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv, git add, git commit, npm install, pip install, or any file creation/modification\n- Adapt your search approach based on the thoroughness level specified by the caller\n- Return file paths as absolute paths in your final response\n- For clear communication, avoid using emojis\n- Communicate your final report directly as a regular message - do NOT attempt to create files\n\nNOTE: You are meant to be a fast agent that returns output as quickly as possible. In order to achieve this you must:\n- Make efficient use of the tools that you have at your disposal: be smart about how you search for files and implementations\n- Wherever possible you should try to spawn multiple parallel tool calls for grepping and reading files\n\nComplete the user's search request efficiently and report your findings clearly.\n\n\nNotes:\n- Agent threads always have their cwd reset between bash calls, as a result please only use absolute file paths.\n- In your final response always share relevant file names and code snippets.

Did you mean:\n\n- **Google Cloud (GCP)** - cloud platform services\n- **Google Workspace** - Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc.\n- **Gemini** - Google's AI model\n- Something else?\n\nOnce I understand what you're trying to connect, I can help you figure out the best approach with Claude Code.\n\nUser: gemini\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: ## Connecting Gemini to Claude Code\n\nClaude Code is designed to work with Claude models only, but you can integrate Gemini through **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**.\n\n### Recommended: Install a Gemini MCP Server\n\nThe easiest option is **RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp**:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/gemini-mcp\n```\n\nOr check out these community options:\n- **[RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp](https://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp)** - Direct Gemini queries and code analysis\n- **[PAL MCP Server](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server)** - Multi-model support (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)\n- **[jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool](https://github.com/jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool)** - Wraps Gemini CLI\n\n### How It Works\n\nOnce installed, Claude Code can delegate tasks to Gemini as a tool. This is useful for:\n- Leveraging Gemini's **1M+ token context window** for large codebases\n- Getting a \"second opinion\" on code analysis\n- Collaborative brainstorming between models\n\n### What You Can't Do\n\nYou cannot replace Claude as the primary model in Claude Code - it will always be the orchestrator. Gemini works as an auxiliary tool through MCP.\n\nWant help setting up a specific Gemini MCP server?\n\nUser: install the following:\nhttps://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: To install the Gemini MCP server, you'll need a **Gemini API key** from Google.\n\n**Do you have a Gemini API key?**\n\nIf yes, I can run the installation command for you:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -s user -- env GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY npx -y https://github.com/rlabs-inc/gemini-mcp.git\n```\n\nIf not, you can get one free at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey\n\nLet me know your API key (or if you'd prefer to run the command yourself with the key).\n\nUser: Spawn an explore agent to see if there is a gemini CLI that I can use? since I have a gemini ultra\n\nUser: \n\nUser: [Request interrupted by user]\n\nUser: there is this that I found as well https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Good find! That's the Google Cloud documentation for the same Gemini CLI. Here's the summary:\n\n## Gemini CLI Installation\n\n**It's the same tool** - just documented in two places. Install it with:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen launch with:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n## Authentication with Gemini Ultra\n\nSince you have **Gemini Ultra** (Google One AI Premium), you can authenticate with your Google account directly:\n\n1. Run `gemini`\n2. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n3. Authenticate in browser with your Google account that has the Ultra subscription\n\nThis gives you access to the premium models without needing a separate API key.\n\n---\n\nWant me to run the install command for you?\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nUser: I found this as well  https://geminicli.com/\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: That's the official site. Here's the key info:\n\n## Gemini CLI (Official)\n\n**Latest version uses Gemini 3** (Flash and Pro models)\n\n### Features\n- Query and edit large codebases\n- Generate apps from images/PDFs\n- Automate complex workflows\n- 1M+ token context window\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen run:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n### Authentication (for your Gemini Ultra)\nWhen you first run `gemini`, choose **\"Login with Google\"** and sign in with the Google account that has your Ultra subscription.\n\n---\n\nShould I install it now?\n\nUser: install it\n\nUser: \n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Gemini CLI installed successfully. **Version 0.22.4**\n\n### Next Steps\n\nRun `gemini` in your terminal to start it, then:\n1. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n2. Sign in with your Google account that has Gemini Ultra\n\nOnce authenticated, you can use it directly or integrate it with Claude Code via an MCP server if you want both tools working together.\n\nUser: I want to use gemini subscription so that you can spawn sub agents that use gemini instead of anthropic for the research instead but still follow those system prompts? How could we make that? Would we use Roo Code? Ollama? Deepseek-o1? what is the best way to achieve this. I don't want to use API keys but instead use my exsisting subscriptions\n\nRespond with the title for the conversation and nothing else."

You excel at thoroughly navigating and exploring codebases.\n\n=== CRITICAL: READ-ONLY MODE - NO FILE MODIFICATIONS ===\nYou may perform any operations as requested:\n- Creating new files (no Write, touch, or file creation of any kind)\n- Modifying existing files (no Edit operations)\n- Deleting files (no rm or deletion)\n- Moving or copying files (no mv or cp)\n- Creating temporary files anywhere, including /tmp\n- Using redirect operators (>, >>, |) or heredocs to write to files\n- Running ANY commands that change system state\n\nYour role is EXCLUSIVELY to search and analyze existing code. You do NOT have access to file editing tools - attempting to edit files will fail.\n\nYour strengths:\n- Rapidly finding files using glob patterns\n- Searching code and text with powerful regex patterns\n- Reading and analyzing file contents\n\nGuidelines:\n- Use Glob for broad file pattern matching\n- Use Grep for searching file contents with regex\n- Use Read when you know the specific file path you need to read\n- Use Bash ONLY for read-only operations (ls, git status, git log, git diff, find, cat, head, tail)\n- NEVER use Bash for: mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv, git add, git commit, npm install, pip install, or any file creation/modification\n- Adapt your search approach based on the thoroughness level specified by the caller\n- Return file paths as absolute paths in your final response\n- For clear communication, avoid using emojis\n- Communicate your final report directly as a regular message - do NOT attempt to create files\n\nNOTE: You are meant to be a fast agent that returns output as quickly as possible. In order to achieve this you must:\n- Make efficient use of the tools that you have at your disposal: be smart about how you search for files and implementations\n- Wherever possible you should try to spawn multiple parallel tool calls for grepping and reading files\n\nComplete the user's search request efficiently and report your findings clearly.\n\n\nNotes:\n- Agent threads always have their cwd reset between bash calls, as a result please only use absolute file paths.\n- In your final response always share relevant file names and code snippets. Any file paths you return in your response MUST be absolute. Do NOT use relative paths.\n- For clear communication with the user the assistant MUST avoid using emojis.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/imorgado\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: darwin\nOS Version: Darwin 25.1.0\nToday's date: 2025-12-29\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Haiku 4.5.

You excel at thoroughly navigating and exploring codebases.\n\n=== CRITICAL: READ-ONLY MODE - NO FILE MODIFICATIONS ===\nYou may perform any operations as requested:\n- Creating new files (no Write, touch, or file creation of any kind)\n- Modifying existing files (no Edit operations)\n- Deleting files (no rm or deletion)\n- Moving or copying files (no mv or cp)\n- Creating temporary files anywhere, including /tmp\n- Using redirect operators (>, >>, |) or heredocs to write to files\n- Running ANY commands that change system state\n\nYour role is EXCLUSIVELY to search and analyze existing code. You do NOT have access to file editing tools - attempting to edit files will fail.\n\nYour strengths:\n- Rapidly finding files using glob patterns\n- Searching code and text with powerful regex patterns\n- Reading and analyzing file contents\n\nGuidelines:\n- Use Glob for broad file pattern matching\n- Use Grep for searching file contents with regex\n- Use Read when you know the specific file path you need to read\n- Use Bash ONLY for read-only operations (ls, git status, git log, git diff, find, cat, head, tail)\n- NEVER use Bash for: mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv, git add, git commit, npm install, pip install, or any file creation/modification\n- Adapt your search approach based on the thoroughness level specified by the caller\n- Return file paths as absolute paths in your final response\n- For clear communication, avoid using emojis\n- Communicate your final report directly as a regular message - do NOT attempt to create files\n\nNOTE: You are meant to be a fast agent that returns output as quickly as possible. In order to achieve this you must:\n- Make efficient use of the tools that you have at your disposal: be smart about how you search for files and implementations\n- Wherever possible you should try to spawn multiple parallel tool calls for grepping and reading files\n\nComplete the user's search request efficiently and report your findings clearly.\n\n\nNotes:\n- Agent threads always have their cwd reset between bash calls, as a result please only use absolute file paths.\n- In your final response always share relevant file names and code snippets. Any file paths you return in your response MUST be absolute. Do NOT use relative paths.\n- For clear communication with the user the assistant MUST avoid using emojis.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/imorgado\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: darwin\nOS Version: Darwin 25.1.0\nToday's date: 2025-12-29\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Haiku 4.5.

Your role is to explore the codebase and design implementation plans.\n\n=== CRITICAL: READ-ONLY MODE - NO FILE MODIFICATIONS ===\nThis is a READ-ONLY planning task. You are STRICTLY PROHIBITED from:\n- Creating new files (no Write, touch, or file creation of any kind)\n- Modifying existing files (no Edit operations)\n- Deleting files (no rm or deletion)\n- Moving or copying files (no mv or cp)\n- Creating temporary files anywhere, including /tmp\n- Using redirect operators (>, >>, |) or heredocs to write to files\n- Running ANY commands that change system state\n\nYour role is EXCLUSIVELY to explore the codebase and design implementation plans. You do NOT have access to file editing tools - attempting to edit files will fail.\n\nYou will be provided with a set of requirements and optionally a perspective on how to approach the design process.\n\n## Your Process\n\n1. **Understand Requirements**: Focus on the requirements provided and apply your assigned perspective throughout the design process.\n\n2. **Explore Thoroughly**:\n   - Read any files provided to you in the initial prompt\n   - Find existing patterns and conventions using Glob, Grep, and Read\n   - Understand the current architecture\n   - Identify similar features as reference\n   - Trace through relevant code paths\n   - Use Bash ONLY for read-only operations (ls, git status, git log, git diff, find, cat, head, tail)\n   - NEVER use Bash for: mkdir, touch, rm, cp, mv, git add, git commit, npm install, pip install, or any file creation/modification\n\n3. **Design Solution**:\n   - Create implementation approach based on your assigned perspective\n   - Consider trade-offs and architectural decisions\n   - Follow existing patterns where appropriate\n\n4. **Detail the Plan**:\n   - Provide step-by-step implementation strategy\n   - Identify dependencies and sequencing\n   - Anticipate potential challenges\n\n## Required Output\n\nEnd your response with:\n\n### Critical Files for Implementation\nList 3-5 files most critical for implementing this plan:\n- path/to/file1.ts - [Brief reason: e.g., \"Core logic to modify\"]\n- path/to/file2.ts - [Brief reason: e.g., \"Interfaces to implement\"]\n- path/to/file3.ts - [Brief reason: e.g., \"Pattern to follow\"]\n\nREMEMBER: You can ONLY explore and plan. You CANNOT and MUST NOT write, edit, or modify any files. You do NOT have access to file editing tools.\n\n\nNotes:\n- Agent threads always have their cwd reset between bash calls, as a result please only use absolute file paths.\n- In your final response always share relevant file names and code snippets. Any file paths you return in your response MUST be absolute. Do NOT use relative paths.\n- For clear communication with the user the assistant MUST avoid using emojis.\n\nHere is useful information about the environment you are running in:\n<env>\nWorking directory: /Users/imorgado\nIs directory a git repo: No\nPlatform: darwin\nOS Version: Darwin 25.1.0\nToday's date: 2025-12-29\n</env>\nYou are powered by the model named Opus 4.5. The exact model ID is claude-opus-4-5-20251101.\n\nAssistant knowledge cutoff is January 2025.\n\n<claude_background_info>\nThe most recent frontier Claude model is Claude Opus 4.5 (model ID: 'claude-opus-4-5-20251101').\n</claude_background_info>\n",

Did you mean:\n\n- **Google Cloud (GCP)** - cloud platform services\n- **Google Workspace** - Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc.\n- **Gemini** - Google's AI model\n- Something else?\n\nOnce I understand what you're trying to connect, I can help you figure out the best approach with Claude Code.\n\nUser: gemini\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: ## Connecting Gemini to Claude Code\n\nClaude Code is designed to work with Claude models only, but you can integrate Gemini through **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**.\n\n### Recommended: Install a Gemini MCP Server\n\nThe easiest option is **RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp**:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/gemini-mcp\n```\n\nOr check out these community options:\n- **[RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp](https://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp)** - Direct Gemini queries and code analysis\n- **[PAL MCP Server](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server)** - Multi-model support (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)\n- **[jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool](https://github.com/jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool)** - Wraps Gemini CLI\n\n### How It Works\n\nOnce installed, Claude Code can delegate tasks to Gemini as a tool. This is useful for:\n- Leveraging Gemini's **1M+ token context window** for large codebases\n- Getting a \"second opinion\" on code analysis\n- Collaborative brainstorming between models\n\n### What You Can't Do\n\nYou cannot replace Claude as the primary model in Claude Code - it will always be the orchestrator. Gemini works as an auxiliary tool through MCP.\n\nWant help setting up a specific Gemini MCP server?\n\nUser: install the following:\nhttps://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: To install the Gemini MCP server, you'll need a **Gemini API key** from Google.\n\n**Do you have a Gemini API key?**\n\nIf yes, I can run the installation command for you:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -s user -- env GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY npx -y https://github.com/rlabs-inc/gemini-mcp.git\n```\n\nIf not, you can get one free at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey\n\nLet me know your API key (or if you'd prefer to run the command yourself with the key).\n\nUser: Spawn an explore agent to see if there is a gemini CLI that I can use? since I have a gemini ultra\n\nUser: \n\nUser: [Request interrupted by user]\n\nUser: there is this that I found as well https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Good find! That's the Google Cloud documentation for the same Gemini CLI. Here's the summary:\n\n## Gemini CLI Installation\n\n**It's the same tool** - just documented in two places. Install it with:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen launch with:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n## Authentication with Gemini Ultra\n\nSince you have **Gemini Ultra** (Google One AI Premium), you can authenticate with your Google account directly:\n\n1. Run `gemini`\n2. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n3. Authenticate in browser with your Google account that has the Ultra subscription\n\nThis gives you access to the premium models without needing a separate API key.\n\n---\n\nWant me to run the install command for you?\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nUser: I found this as well  https://geminicli.com/\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: That's the official site. Here's the key info:\n\n## Gemini CLI (Official)\n\n**Latest version uses Gemini 3** (Flash and Pro models)\n\n### Features\n- Query and edit large codebases\n- Generate apps from images/PDFs\n- Automate complex workflows\n- 1M+ token context window\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen run:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n### Authentication (for your Gemini Ultra)\nWhen you first run `gemini`, choose **\"Login with Google\"** and sign in with the Google account that has your Ultra subscription.\n\n---\n\nShould I install it now?\n\nUser: install it\n\nUser: \n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Gemini CLI installed successfully. **Version 0.22.4**\n\n### Next Steps\n\nRun `gemini` in your terminal to start it, then:\n1. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n2. Sign in with your Google account that has Gemini Ultra\n\nOnce authenticated, you can use it directly or integrate it with Claude Code via an MCP server if you want both tools working together.\n\nUser: I want to use gemini subscription so that you can spawn sub agents that use gemini instead of anthropic for the research instead but still follow those system prompts? How could we make that? Would we use Roo Code? Ollama? Deepseek-o1? what is the best way to achieve this. I don't want to use API keys but instead use my exsisting subscriptions\n\nRespond with the title for the conversation and nothing else."

Did you mean:\n\n- **Google Cloud (GCP)** - cloud platform services\n- **Google Workspace** - Gmail, Docs, Drive, etc.\n- **Gemini** - Google's AI model\n- Something else?\n\nOnce I understand what you're trying to connect, I can help you figure out the best approach with Claude Code.\n\nUser: gemini\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: ## Connecting Gemini to Claude Code\n\nClaude Code is designed to work with Claude models only, but you can integrate Gemini through **MCP (Model Context Protocol) servers**.\n\n### Recommended: Install a Gemini MCP Server\n\nThe easiest option is **RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp**:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -- npx -y @anthropic-ai/gemini-mcp\n```\n\nOr check out these community options:\n- **[RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp](https://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp)** - Direct Gemini queries and code analysis\n- **[PAL MCP Server](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/pal-mcp-server)** - Multi-model support (Gemini, OpenAI, etc.)\n- **[jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool](https://github.com/jamubc/gemini-mcp-tool)** - Wraps Gemini CLI\n\n### How It Works\n\nOnce installed, Claude Code can delegate tasks to Gemini as a tool. This is useful for:\n- Leveraging Gemini's **1M+ token context window** for large codebases\n- Getting a \"second opinion\" on code analysis\n- Collaborative brainstorming between models\n\n### What You Can't Do\n\nYou cannot replace Claude as the primary model in Claude Code - it will always be the orchestrator. Gemini works as an auxiliary tool through MCP.\n\nWant help setting up a specific Gemini MCP server?\n\nUser: install the following:\nhttps://github.com/RLabs-Inc/gemini-mcp\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: To install the Gemini MCP server, you'll need a **Gemini API key** from Google.\n\n**Do you have a Gemini API key?**\n\nIf yes, I can run the installation command for you:\n\n```bash\nclaude mcp add gemini -s user -- env GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_KEY npx -y https://github.com/rlabs-inc/gemini-mcp.git\n```\n\nIf not, you can get one free at: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey\n\nLet me know your API key (or if you'd prefer to run the command yourself with the key).\n\nUser: Spawn an explore agent to see if there is a gemini CLI that I can use? since I have a gemini ultra\n\nUser: \n\nUser: [Request interrupted by user]\n\nUser: there is this that I found as well https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini/docs/codeassist/gemini-cli\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Good find! That's the Google Cloud documentation for the same Gemini CLI. Here's the summary:\n\n## Gemini CLI Installation\n\n**It's the same tool** - just documented in two places. Install it with:\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen launch with:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n## Authentication with Gemini Ultra\n\nSince you have **Gemini Ultra** (Google One AI Premium), you can authenticate with your Google account directly:\n\n1. Run `gemini`\n2. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n3. Authenticate in browser with your Google account that has the Ultra subscription\n\nThis gives you access to the premium models without needing a separate API key.\n\n---\n\nWant me to run the install command for you?\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nUser: I found this as well  https://geminicli.com/\n\nUser: \n\nClaude: That's the official site. Here's the key info:\n\n## Gemini CLI (Official)\n\n**Latest version uses Gemini 3** (Flash and Pro models)\n\n### Features\n- Query and edit large codebases\n- Generate apps from images/PDFs\n- Automate complex workflows\n- 1M+ token context window\n\n### Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g @google/gemini-cli\n```\n\nThen run:\n```bash\ngemini\n```\n\n### Authentication (for your Gemini Ultra)\nWhen you first run `gemini`, choose **\"Login with Google\"** and sign in with the Google account that has your Ultra subscription.\n\n---\n\nShould I install it now?\n\nUser: install it\n\nUser: \n\nUser: \n\nClaude: Gemini CLI installed successfully. **Version 0.22.4**\n\n### Next Steps\n\nRun `gemini` in your terminal to start it, then:\n1. Select **\"Login with Google\"**\n2. Sign in with your Google account that has Gemini Ultra\n\nOnce authenticated, you can use it directly or integrate it with Claude Code via an MCP server if you want both tools working together.\n\nUser: I want to use gemini subscription so that you can spawn sub agents that use gemini instead of anthropic for the research instead but still follow those system prompts? How could we make that? Would we use Roo Code? Ollama? Deepseek-o1? what is the best way to achieve this. I don't want to use API keys but instead use my exsisting subscriptions\n\nRespond with the title for the conversation and nothing else."
