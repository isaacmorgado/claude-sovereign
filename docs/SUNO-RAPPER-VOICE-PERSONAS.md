## 🎯 KEY TECHNIQUES FOR RAPPER VOCALS IN SUNO AI

### 1. Vocal Descriptor Layering

Combine multiple elements for precision:
```
[Genre] + [Vocal Range] + [Vocal Texture] + [Delivery Style] + [Effects]

Example: [melodic trap] [male tenor] [auto-tuned robotic] [laid-back slurred] [heavy reverb]
```

### 2. Production Effects Integration

Match vocal processing to genre:
- **Drake:** Clean, crisp, subtle autotune, reverb/delay on separate track
- **Future:** Heavy autotune (fast retune), robotic, non-negotiable signature
- **ASAP Rocky:** Reverb/delay heavy, lo-fi muffled, psychedelic atmospheric

### 3. Delivery Style Keywords

Be specific about flow:
- **Conversational, intimate, vulnerable** (Drake emotional)
- **Confident, assertive, commanding** (Drake flex)
- **Laid-back, slurred, hypnotic** (Future)
- **Rapid-fire, aggressive, manic** (Future dark)
- **Smooth, effortless, cool** (Rocky fashion)
- **Punchy, rhythmic, swagger** (Rocky hard)

### 4. Ad-Lib Specification

Include ad-lib style:
- **Call-&-response, vocal chops** (Drake club)
- **Repetitive phrases, vocal runs** (Future melodic)
- **Trippy, atmospheric, reverb-drenched** (Rocky psychedelic)

### 5. Vocal Range Precision

Specify exact range:
- **Tenor-baritone** (Drake)
- **Tenor** (Future)
- **Deep baritone** (ASAP Rocky)

### 6. Match Vocals to BPM/Energy

Vocal delivery should match tempo:
- **70-90 BPM:** Laid-back, smooth, melodic delivery
- **100-120 BPM:** Moderate, balanced rap-sing style
- **130-150 BPM:** Rapid, energetic, aggressive delivery

### 7. Use Bypass Techniques

Apply lyrical bypasses naturally:
- **To → 2, For → 4, And → &** (maintains flow)
- **No → know, Be → b, You → u** (phonetic similarity)

## 🔧 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "Vocals don't sound like the artist"
- Add more specific vocal descriptors (deep, smooth, robotic)
- Match delivery style to BPM (laid-back for slow, rapid for fast)
- Specify effects clearly (autotune, reverb, delay)
- Include production characteristics in style prompt

### "Autotune isn't strong enough" (Future style)
- Use phrases like "heavily auto-tuned," "robotic," "fast retune speed"
- Emphasize "non-negotiable signature element"
- Add "processed, pitch-corrected, vocoder-like"

### "Voice isn't deep enough" (ASAP Rocky style)
- Specify "deep baritone," "low-pitched," "bass-heavy vocals"
- Add "commanding resonance," "muffled lo-fi quality"
- Use "sub-bass vocal tone"

### "Delivery sounds generic"
- Be specific: "slurred," "hypnotic," "confident swagger"
- Add artist references: "similar to [artist]"
- Describe flow: "conversational," "rapid-fire," "melodic sing-rap"
