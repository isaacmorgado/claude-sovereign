# Terminal Scripts & Hacks

Mark Complete

Practical scripts your coding agent can build and run. DNS benchmarking, network diagnostics, system optimization, and more.

IntroStepsTroubleshootPrerequisitesResourcesFAQQuiz

### What This Is

A collection of practical scripts and automation that your coding agent can build and execute directly in your terminal. These aren't theoretical exercises - they're tools that solve real problems. Test which DNS server is fastest for you, monitor your network, automate tedious tasks, and more.

### What You'll Learn

* How to ask your coding agent to build and run diagnostic scripts
* DNS benchmarking to find the fastest servers for your location
* Network monitoring and troubleshooting tools
* System information and optimization scripts
* Automation for repetitive tasks

### Why It Matters

Most people don't realize their coding agent can do more than write code - it can run scripts, analyze output, and iterate until the problem is solved. These examples show you what's possible when you start thinking of your agent as a tool that can interact with your system.

# Web Scraping & Data Extraction

Mark Complete

Have your coding agent build scrapers for any website. Extract data, handle pagination, export to CSV/JSON.

IntroStepsTroubleshootPrerequisitesResourcesFAQQuiz

### What This Is

Web scraping is extracting data from websites programmatically. Instead of manually copying information, your coding agent can build scripts that pull exactly the data you need - product prices, job listings, contact info, research data, whatever. The agent handles the technical complexity while you describe what you want.

### What You'll Learn

* How to describe scraping tasks to your coding agent
* Extracting structured data from any website
* Handling pagination, authentication, and dynamic content
* Exporting data to CSV, JSON, or databases
* Respecting rate limits and robots.txt

### Why It Matters

Data is everywhere, but it's often trapped in websites without APIs. Scraping lets you unlock that data for analysis, monitoring, research, or building your own tools. With a coding agent, you don't need to learn the technical details - you just describe what data you want.

# API Reverse Engineering

Mark Complete

Figure out how apps communicate with their servers. Discover undocumented APIs and build your own clients.

IntroStepsTroubleshootPrerequisitesResourcesFAQQuiz

### What This Is

Every app that shows you data is fetching it from somewhere. API reverse engineering is figuring out how apps talk to their servers - what endpoints they hit, what data they send, what comes back. Once you understand the API, your coding agent can build tools that interact with it directly.

### What You'll Learn

* Intercepting network traffic with proxy tools
* Understanding API request/response patterns
* Authenticating with undocumented APIs
* Building custom clients for any service
* When to use this vs official APIs or scraping

### Why It Matters

Official APIs are limited or don't exist for many services. But if there's an app, there's an API behind it. Reverse engineering lets you access data and functionality that isn't officially exposed - building integrations, automations, or tools the company never intended.

# Browser Automation

Mark Complete

Automate anything you do in a browser. Your coding agent builds Playwright scripts that click, type, and navigate for you.

IntroStepsTroubleshootPrerequisitesResourcesFAQQuiz

### What This Is

Browser automation is scripting a real browser to do things automatically - clicking buttons, filling forms, navigating pages, taking screenshots. Tools like Playwright control Chrome/Firefox/Safari programmatically. Your coding agent writes the scripts. You just describe what you want to automate.

### What You'll Learn

* Describing browser tasks for your coding agent
* Automating repetitive web workflows
* Handling logins, forms, and dynamic content
* Taking screenshots and generating PDFs
* Running automations on a schedule

### Why It Matters

We spend hours doing repetitive browser tasks - checking things, filling forms, downloading reports, updating spreadsheets. Browser automation handles the tedium so you can focus on work that matters. If you can do it manually, your agent can automate it.
